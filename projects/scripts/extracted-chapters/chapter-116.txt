Chapter 116
The Dark Ministry of Evil Angels
================================

Against whom do we wrestle? “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world,
against spiritual wickedness in high places." Ephesians 6:12
When the evil angels first sinned, where were they cast and why? “For if God
spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into
chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment." 2 Peter 2:4.
What is Satan himself called? “The god of this world." 2 Corinthians 4:4. "The
prince of this world." John 14:30 "The prince of the power of the air." Ephesians 2:2.
What is the chief work of the devil and his angels? How earnestly does he
carryon this work? “And he [Jesus] was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of
Satan." Mark 1:13. "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour." 1 Peter 5:8. (See Revelation 12:9, 12;
16:14.)
What are we warned not to do? “Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down
upon your wrath: neither give place to the devil." Ephesians 4:26, 27.
As we near the close of human probation and the end of time, why may we
expect an increase in demon manifestations? “Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of
the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that
he hath but a short time." Revelation 12:12.
What warning has been especially given to us who live in these last days?
“Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith,
giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils." 1 Timothy 4:1.
What will be the final doom of Satan, his angels, and all the wicked of earth?
“Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:" Matthew 25:41 "For, behold, the
day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly,
shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that
it shall leave them neither root nor branch." Malachi 4:1
