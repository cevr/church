Chapter 7
Chapter 7
=========

chapter 7 is Babylon (605-538 B.C.). The bear is Medo-Persia (538-334 B.C.). The
leopard beast is Grecia (334-301 B.C., at which time it becomes divided into four
kingdoms which continue on until around 168 B.C.). The terrible beast is Pagan Rome (168
B.C. to the 5th Century A.D., when it becomes broken into ten kingdoms). The little horn is
Papal Rome, which gained full power by 538 A.D., after uprooting three kingdoms (the
Heruli, Vandals and Ostrogoths).
DANIEL 8 is composed of two major parts. The first is an EVENT prophecy that
closely parallels the prophecy of Daniel 7. This prophecy is about two beasts and a little
horn that follows them (Dan 8:1-12, 20-25). The first beast, a ram, is Medo-Persia
(538-334 B.C.), and the he-goat which struck it down was Grecia (334-168 B.C.). The
"notable horn" was Alexander the Great who, before his death in 323, carved out the largest
empire in history up to that time - in only ten years. When he was broken off in the prime of
life, the empire divided into four sections. The little horn is Pagan Rome which, historians
tell us, was taken over by Papal Rome. Much of Daniel 7 and 8 (7:8, 19-26 and 8:9-12,
23-25) is given to a concern over this power which would speak blasphemies (7:8, 20;
8:11), and seek to kill God's people (7:21, 25; 8:10, 24-25), cast down the truth (8:12, 25),
tear God's Sanctuary down from heaven (8:11), and even try to change the Law of God
(7:25). Revelation 13 (read verses 6-7, for example) deals with this same little horn power
- the Papacy.
But there is a second part to Daniel 8: This is a TIME prophecy (Dan. 8: 13-14, 26).
The prophecy itself is given in Daniel 8: 14. "Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." Careful reading of this chapter reveals that while the
angel Gabriel was told to explain the vision of Daniel 8 to the prophet (8:16), yet only the
event prophecy was explained (8:17-25), while the time prophecy was only referred to
(8:26). Daniel nearly fainted under the burden (8:27), and the prayer of Daniel 9 is the
result.
DANIEL 9 begins with the prophet's prayer for guidance and help for his people
(Dan 9:1-19). Gabriel, the one whom he had seen in his earlier vision of Daniel 8 (9:21), is
then sent in answer to his prayer (9:20), and in order to complete the explanation (9:22-23).
The SEVENTY WEEK PROPHECY is then given (Dan 9:24-27). Seventy
weeks are "determined" ("cut off' in Hebrew-cut off from the larger 2300 day [year]
prophecy) for the Jews. Therefore, the first part of the 2300 Day prophecy of Daniel 8:14 is
time allocated to the Jews to conclude their probation as God's specially favored nation.
In Bible prophecy, a day equals a year (Num 14:34; Ezek 4:6). The decree of
Artaxerxes, given in his seventh year as king-in 457 B.C. (Dan 9:25; Ezra 6:14; 7:6-8),
restoring the Jewish government, begins this vast time prophecy of 2300 years. The first 70
weeks (Dan 9:24-27) of this prophecy, cut off or allotted to the Jews, equals 490 years. The
walls of Jerusalem were rebuilt in 1 week or 49 years (408 B.C.). Another 62 weeks brings
us to the anointing of Christ for His mission in 27 A.D. 483 years are now past; only 1 week
remains of the 70. In the midst of this week (Dan 9:26-27), 31 A.D., Messiah is cut off or
crucified. A second half-week of 3 1/2 years brings us to 34 A.D., when at the stoning of
Stephen the gospel is taken to the Gentiles.
In 34 A.D. the 70 weeks, or 490 years, is completed. 1810 years remains to be
fulfilled in this longest of Bible time prophecies - the 2300 year prophecy of Daniel 8:14.
At its termination in 1844 A.D. began the "cleansing of the sanctuary" predicted in this
important passage, Daniel 8:14.
Jesus is our High Priest in the heavenly Sanctuary (that the earthly was patterned
after). In 1844 began His final work within it, prior to His Second Advent to the earth for
His people.
