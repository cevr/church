How long has sin reigned? “He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil
sinneth from the beginning." 1 John 3:8.
What others sinned with Satan? “God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto
judgment." 2 Peter 2:4.
Can there be sin where there is no law? “Because the law worketh wrath; for
where no law is, there is no transgression." Rom. 4:15.
How was the first death brought about? “And Cain talked with Abel his brother;
and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him." Gen. 4:8.
What was the difference between the characters of the two men? “Not as Cain,
who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because
his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous." 1 John 3:12.
Did the Lord impute sin to Cain for taking the life of his brother? “If thou
doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door...
And he [God] said,"... the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground...
now art thou cursed from the earth." Gen. 4:7-11.
In what condition was mankind before the flood? “The earth also was corrupt
before God; and the earth was filled with violence." Gen. 6:11.
What did God purpose to do with the people of that day?” And God said unto
Noah, The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth is filled with violence through
them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth." Gen. 6:13.
What was Noah called? “And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth
person, a preacher of righteousness." 2 Peter 2:5.
Why did the Lord destroy Sodom? “The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners
before the Lord exceedingly." Gen. 13:13. "We will destroy this place, because the cry of
them is waxen great before the face of the Lord." Gen. 19:13.
By what standard were their deeds weighed? “And delivered just Lot, vexed
with the filthy conversation of the wicked; for that righteous man dwelling among them, in
seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds." 2

I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" Gen. 39:9.

following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before
the children of Israel." 1 Kings 21:26.

shall therefore keep all My statutes, and all My judgments and do them: that the land,
whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. And ye shall not walk in the manners
of the nation, which I cast out before you; for they committed all these things, and therefore
I abhorred them." Lev. 20:22, 23.

Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham." John 8:39.
