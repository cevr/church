Chapter 75
Not Justified by the Law
========================

What positive statement does the apostle make concerning the law? “Therefore
by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight." Rom. 3:20.
What does the law do? “I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known
lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. Rom. 7:7 (Rom. 3:20, last clause).
Will the law do this work for others besides the Jews? “Now we know that what
things soever. the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may
be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God." Rom. 3:19.
What is the nature of God's law? “Wherefore the law is holy, and the
commandment holy, and just, and good." Rom. 7:12.
It is manifest that a law, the office of which is to point out sin, can never justify
one from the transgressions of that law. How, then, can man be justified? “Being
justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus." Rom. 3:24.
But does the fact that we are subjects of God's grace, give us license to sin?
“What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to
whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?" Rom. 6:15,
16.
How must those walk who would be free from condemnation? “There is
therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the
flesh, but after the Spirit." Rom. 8:1.
