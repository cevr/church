The Prophetic Symbols of Daniel 8
=================================

Where was Daniel at the time that this vision was given to him? “I saw in a
vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the
province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai." Daniel 8:2.
In this vision, what did Daniel see first? “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw,
and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns." Verse 3.
What was next shown to him? “As I was considering, behold, an he goat came
from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had
a notable horn between his eyes. And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had
seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power. And I saw him
come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram,
and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast
him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the
ram out of his hand. Therefore the he goat waxed very great." Verses 5-8.
When the notable horn was broken, what came up next? “When he was strong,
the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds."
Verse 8.
What important horn came out of one of these horns? “Out of one of them came
forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
toward the pleasant land. And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them." Verses 9-10.
What command was then given to an angel that stood nearby? “I heard a man's
voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to
understand the vision." Verse 16.
What were the first words that the angel then spoke to the prophet?
“Understand, a son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision." Verse 17.
Did the angel then explain about the ram and the he-goat? "The ram which
thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the
king of Grecia." Verses 20-21.
What is represented by the four horns that come up in place of the broken
one? “Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up
out of the nation, but not in his power." Verse 22.
What is the meaning of the "little horn" in verse 9? "In the latter time of their
[successors of Alexander] kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of
fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up." Verse 23.
What was this little horn to do to God's sanctuary? "Yea, he magnified himself
even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place
of his sanctuary was cast down." Daniel 8:11.
What was finally to happen to this persecuting power? “The judgment shall sit,
and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end." Daniel
7:26.
At what time, according to this important prophecy, was the sanctuary to be
cleansed? “He said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the
sanctuary be cleansed." Daniel 8:14.
How did this view of desolation and persecution by the little horn power affect
the prophet? “I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the
king's business." Daniel 8:27.
