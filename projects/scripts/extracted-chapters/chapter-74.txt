Chapter 74
The End of the Law
==================

To the believer what does Christ become? “For Christ is the end of the law for
righteousness to everyone that believeth." Rom. 10:4.
In what sense is the word end (Greek, telos) sometimes used in the Scriptures?
Object, intention, or design? "Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end
of the Lord." James 5:11.
What was the object of the law?” And the commandment, which was ordained to
life, I found to be unto death." Rom. 7:10.
What further is the end, or object, of the law? “Now the end of the
commandment is charity out of a pure heart." 1 Tim. 1:5.
What is charity, or love? “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is
the fulfilling of the law." Rom. 13:10 (1 John 5:3).
Why did God send His Son to the world?” For what the law could not do, in that
it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and
for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in
us." Rom. 8:3, 4.
Then what is one enabled to do through Christ? “That the requirement of the
law might be fulfilled in us." Rom. 8:4 (see margin of Revised Version).
