Chapter 82
Penalty for Transgression
=========================

In the old dispensation, how was an idolater punished? “And thou shalt stone
him with stones, that he die; be- cause he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy
God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage." Deut.
13:6-10.
What was done to a blasphemer? “And he that blasphemeth the name of the
Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him, as
well the stranger, as he that is born in the land." Lev. 24:16.
How was a perverse son punished? “If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son,
which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother,... all the men of his
city shall stone him with stones, that he die." Deut. 21:18-21.
What punishment was inflicted upon an adulterer? “The adulterer and the
adulteress shall surely be put to death." Lev. 20:10.
Has the death penalty for sin really been abolished? “For the wages of sin is
death." Rom. 6:23.
Why is not the old penalty executed in this dispensation by gospel ministers?
“Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us." 2 Cor.
5:20.
To whom does vengeance belong? “Vengeance is Mine. I will repay, saith the
Lord." Rom. 12:19.
To whom has the execution of the death penalty for sin been committed? “For
as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and
hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man." John
5:26, 27.
And when will He execute it? “And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam,
prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to
execute judgment upon all." Jude 14-15.
