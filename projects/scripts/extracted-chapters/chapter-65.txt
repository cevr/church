Chapter 65
Events Connected with the Millennium
====================================

What great event will take place at the coming of Christ? “For the Lord Himself
shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump
of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air." 1 Thess. 4:16, 17.
Where will the saints then be taken? “In My Father's house are many mansions;
if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself." John 14:2, 3.
In what condition will the earth be after the coming of Christ? “I beheld the
earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens and they had no light." "I
beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken
down at the presence of the Lord, and by His fierce anger." Jer. 4:23, 26 (Isa. 24:1-3).
Will any man be living on the earth at that time?” I beheld, and, lo, there was no
man, and all the birds of the heavens were fled." Jer. 4:25 (Zeph. 1:3).
What is to become of those who are not caught up to heaven with the Lord?
“The Lord hath a controversy with the nations; He will plead with all flesh; He will give
them that are wicked to the sword, saith the Lord." Jer. 25:31 (2 Thess. 1:7, 8).
How long will these resurrected saints reign with Christ in heaven? “And I saw
thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of
them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had
not worshiped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their
foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years." Rev.
20:4.
When were these made to live? “Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and
of Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years." Rev. 20:6.
How long will the wicked remain in their graves? “But the rest of the dead lived
not again until the thou- sand years were finished." Rev. 20:5.
What will be Satan's condition during the thousand years? “And He laid hold
on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand
years." Rev. 20:2.
Where will he be kept? “And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up,
and set a seal upon him." Rev 20:3.
Where is the bottomless pit? “And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a
smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened
by reason of the smoke of the pit." Rev. 9:2.
What is Satan's occupation up to the time of his binding? “Be sober, be
vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom
he may devour." 1 Peter 5:8.
In what sense are we to understand the binding of Satan? The saints are taken
to heaven at the coming of Christ, and the wicked fall dead at His presence, to remain thus
during the thousand years. Satan's occupation is gone; there is nothing left for him to do but
to wander over the desolate earth, and view the terrible work of which he is the author.
There is now no one for him to tempt, and he is therefore bound in his operations.
What will release Satan from this condition? “But the rest of the dead lived not
again until the thousand years were finished." "And when the thousand years are expired,
Satan shall be loosed out of his prison." Rev. 20:5, 7.
For how long a period will he be loosed? “That he should deceive the nations no
more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little
season." Rev. 20:3.
In what work will he immediately engage? “And shall go out to deceive the
nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together
to battle, the number of whom is as the sand of the sea." Rev. 20:8.
What will be the result of their effort to take the city? “And they went up on the
breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and
fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them." Rev. 20:9.
What statement will thus be fulfilled? “Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and
He shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it." Ps.
37:34.
How many will escape this second death? “Blessed and holy is he that hath part
in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power." Rev. 20:6.
What will be the effect of the fire? “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn
as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day
that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root
nor branch." Mal. 4:1.
What, besides the wicked, will feel the effect of this fire? “But the heavens
[atmosphere heavens] and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store,
reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." 2 Peter 3:7.
What will be the result?” And the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth
also; and the works that are therein shall be burned up." 2 Peter 3:10.
Then what will come? “Never the less we, according to His promise, look for new
heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness." 2 Peter 3:13.
Who will inherit the new earth?” For evil doers shall be cut off; but those that
wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth." Ps. 37:9.
What will be their condition there? “But the meek shall inherit the earth; and
shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace." Ps. 37:11.
How will every intelligent creature in the universe then show his appreciation
of the gift of eternal life?” And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing,
and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
Lamb forever and ever." Rev. 5:13.
THE BIBLICAL MILLENNIUM
We live in the last days of history. The end of life as men now know it is nearly ended. Soon Jesus
will return. We only have one period of probation and that is during our present life. The Millennium will not
be a thousand years of glory and peace here on earth. And it will not be an age of technological progress or a
"second chance" for the wicked. All mankind will not be converted before it, during it, or after it. And neither
Christ nor His redeemed ones will be on the earth during that thousand years. Here is the truth about the
Millennium and the events that mark its beginning and end: 1. Jesus is going to return for His people: He
promised us that He would (John 14:1-3), and so we can know that He will. 2. There are four identifying
marks of His Second Advent that cannot be counterfeited by false Christs:(a) He will come so that all alive on
the earth at that time can see Him return (Rev.1:7; Acts 1:9; Matt. 24:30, 23.27).(b) He will come so all can
hear Him as He returns (Matt. 24:31; 1 Thess. 4:16). (c) He will come in immense glory, that of His own and
the millions of angels that will come with Him (Luke 9:26; Matt. 28:2-4; Matt. 25:31; Rev. 6:14-17).(d) He
will come unexpectedly (Matt. 24:44; 24:36).3. His Second Coming will mark the beginning of the
Millennium. Six events will take place: (a) He will raise the righteous dead (1 Thess. 4:16). (b) He will catch
up the righteous living together with the resurrected righteous dead-to meet Him in the clouds (1 Thess.
4:17).(c) He will change their vile bodies to be like unto His glorious body (Phil. 3:20-21) and translate them
(1 Cor. 15:51-55; Isa. 25:9).(d) Having gathered all the righteous (1 Thess. 4:17-18; Matt. 25:34-40; 24:30,
31), He will take His redeemed ones to heaven (John 14:1-3; 17:24; 1 Thess. 4:16-18).(e) He will destroy the
living wicked with the brightness of His coming (Luke 17:26-30; 2 Thess. 2:8). (f) He will bind Satan to this
earth (Rev. 20:2, 3).4. During the Millennium, the earth will be desolate (Rev. 20:3; Jer 4:23-26; Isa. 24:1, 3),
the wicked are dead (2 Thess. 2:8), there is no man left (Isa. 24:20-22; Jer 4:25, 26; 25:31-33), Satan is bound
on a desolate earth (Rev. 20:1-3), and the righteous are in heaven (Rev. 20:4, 6; Dan. 7:22) engaged in a work
of judgment (Rev. 20:4; 1 Cor. 6:1-3; Acts 24:25; Jude 6).5. At the close of the Millennium, the Holy City
descends from heaven (Rev. 20:9; 21:1-5; Zech. 14:4,9); the wicked are raised, the "second resurrection"
(Rev. 20:5, first part), and Satan is thus loosed to deceive them again (Rev. 20:7-8); Satan and the wicked
surround the City to take it (Rev. 20:8, 9); all of the wicked are destroyed (Rev. 20:9), and this earth is made
new (Rev. 20:1-5; 2 Pet. 3:10-14).
