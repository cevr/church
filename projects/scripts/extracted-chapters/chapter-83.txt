Chapter 83
Institution of the Sabbath
==========================

In his mention of the "little horn," what does the prophet say that power
should think to do?” And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall
wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws." Dan. 7:25.
What does Paul say the "man of sin" should do? “Except there come a falling
away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth
himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped." 2 Thess. 2:3, 4.
NOTE. - There is only one way by which any power could exalt itself above God. Although it might
enact numberless ceremonies, the observance of which would be demanded as strictly as God requires His
commandments to be obeyed, yet as long as the people felt obliged to obey God also, no power could be said
to be elevated above God. It would only be equal with Him. In order, then, for this power to exalt itself above
God, it must of necessity seek to change God's law, or some portion of it, and require obedience to his own
law instead of God's.
What power has attempted to change the law of God? The papacy; as proved by
history and the admissions of the Catholic writers themselves, such as the following:
Question - "Have you any other way of proving that the church has power to
institute festivals of precept?"
Answer - "Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all
modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of
Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change
for which there is not scriptural authority." Doctrinal Catechism (Catholic), page 174. See
