Study Title: The Word of God as Light

Question: What does the Bible say the Word of God does for us?

Biblical Answer: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.” (Psalm 119:105)

Explanation: The text uses the image of a lamp guiding one’s steps. In ancient times, lamps illuminated only a short distance ahead. Likewise, Scripture gives just enough light for each step of life.

[DYK] Oil lamps in biblical times were small clay vessels—practical, personal, and always carried close. The metaphor implies God’s guidance is intimate, near, and continuous.

Question: What does "light" represent in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: [Scripture references if available in source text, or derived explanation]

Progressive Disclosure: • moral clarity • truth • direction • safety • God’s presence

[ILL] Just as headlights don’t show the entire highway at once but give enough visibility to drive safely, God’s Word gives enough clarity to move forward day by day.

Term Definition: “Path” in Hebrew often refers to one’s life‑journey—our decisions, values, and direction. Scripture does not merely inform; it shapes the route we take.

Deeper Insight: Scripture as “light” links back to Creation (“Let there be light”) and forward to Christ (“I am the light of the world”). The written Word and the Living Word operate together to guide humanity.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion: • The sanctuary lampstand as a symbol of God’s continual presence • Early Adventist use of the “path and the light” metaphor (e.g., early Millerite imagery) • Light in the prophetic writings (Isaiah’s Servant Songs) • Christ as Light in John’s Gospel • The closing theme in Revelation: no night, for the Lamb is the Light

Practical Application: Where do we need light today? • personal decisions • family challenges • moral clarity in a confused world • hope in dark moments God offers the lamp of His Word freely.
