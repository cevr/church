## Introduction (5 min)

### The Great Limitation

- Most Christians live far below their spiritual potential
- [RQ]: What if our greatest enemy isn't Satan, but our own limited expectations
  of God's power? (Matt 17:20)
- [WB]: "Faith Ceiling" = Self-Imposed Limits on God's Power

### Heaven's Perspective vs. Human Perspective

- God's view: "Nothing shall be impossible unto you" (Matt 17:20)
- Our view: "That's too good to be true"
- [Aside]: A child asks their wealthy parent for a bicycle, never dreaming they
  could ask for a car. We often do the same with our infinitely wealthy Heavenly
  Father.

## I. The Mighty Works of Believing Prayer (10 min)

### Biblical Examples of Limitless Faith

- Elijah: Shut up heaven for 3½ years (1 Kings 17:1, James 5:17)
- [WB]: Elijah = "Ordinary man" + Extraordinary Faith = Heaven Obeys (James
  5:17)
- Moses: Parted the Red Sea (Exodus 14:21-22)
- Joshua: Sun stood still (Joshua 10:12-14)
- [RQ]: If these were "ordinary" men like us, what extraordinary things might
  God do through us if we believed without limits? (James 5:17)

### The Pattern of Mighty Works

- They asked specifically and boldly
- They believed God's power exceeded natural laws
- They acted on their faith before seeing results
- [EB]: Daniel 3:17-18 (Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego - faith without conditions)

### Modern Applications

- [EGW]: "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend. Not that it
  is necessary in order to make known to God what we are, but in order to enable
  us to receive Him." (SC 93.1)
- [WB]: Prayer Formula: Specific Request + Unwavering Faith + Action = God's
  Glory

## II. The Foundation: Believing God Can Do Great Things (12 min) [*]

### In the World Around Us

- Mark 11:24 - "Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye
  pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them."
- [RQ]: Do we truly believe God can transform our communities, heal the sick,
  convert the hardest hearts? (Mark 11:24)
- [WB]: God's Power in the World: Salvation + Healing + Transformation = No
  Limits

### In Our Personal Lives

- Romans 12:2 - "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind"
- [RQ]: Do we believe God can completely transform our character, break every
  chain, restore His image in us? (Rom 12:2)
- The restoration process requires believing it's possible
- [EB]: 2 Corinthians 3:18 (Changed from glory to glory)
- [EB]: Philippians 4:13 (I can do all things through Christ)

### Overcoming Self-Imposed Limitations

- Our imagination becomes our ceiling
- [Aside]: Henry Ford said, "Whether you think you can or you think you can't,
  you're right." This applies powerfully to spiritual growth and prayer.
- [EGW]: "We are to be distinguished from the world because God has placed His
  seal upon us, because He manifests His own character in us." (6T 384.2)

## III. The Requirement: We Must Ask (12 min)

### The Divine Prerequisite

- Matthew 7:7-8 - "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
  knock, and it shall be opened unto you"
- [WB]: ASK = Acknowledge + Seek + Keep Knocking (Matt 7:7-8)
- God waits for our invitation to work

### The Burden-Bearing Invitation

- Matthew 11:28-30 - "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and
  I will give you rest"
- [RQ]: How many "burdens" are we carrying that Jesus already offered to bear?
  (Matt 11:28)
- We often struggle with things we've never presented to God in believing prayer

### Paul's Example: The Thorn

- 2 Corinthians 12:7-9 - Paul asked three times, received an answer
- [RQ]: Before accepting something as "God's will," have we earnestly asked for
  deliverance? (2 Cor 12:8)
- [EB]: 1 Kings 3:5 (God said to Solomon, "Ask what I shall give thee")
- Even when the answer is "no," we received a response and grace sufficient

### Trust in Divine vs. Human Wisdom

- Exodus 4:11 - "Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or
  the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?"
- [RQ]: Do we exhaust human remedies before turning to the Creator of all
  healing? (Ex 4:11)
- [WB]: Prayer First → Human Instruments Second → Glory to God Always

## IV. The Standard: Believing in Perfection (12 min)

### God's View of Perfection

- Job 1:8 - "Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in
  the earth, a perfect and an upright man?"
- [RQ]: If God called Job perfect, and we have greater light and Christ's
  completed sacrifice, what might He say of us? (Job 1:8)
- [WB]: Job's Perfection + Christ's Greater Light = Our Potential

### Faith That Receives vs. Doubt That Blocks

- James 1:6-7 - "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
  wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let
  not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord"
- [RQ]: Are we "double-minded" - asking for victory while expecting defeat?
  (James 1:6-7)
- If we don't believe perfection is possible, we'll never strive for it

### The Final Generation Standard

- Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
  keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus"
- Revelation 7:14 - "These are they which... have washed their robes, and made
  them white in the blood of the Lamb"
- [EGW]: "Those who are living upon the earth when the intercession of Christ
  shall cease in the sanctuary above are to stand in the sight of a holy God
  without a mediator." (GC 425.1)
- [RQ]: If these verses don't describe us, where will we be when Jesus comes?
  (Rev 14:12, 7:14)

### The Character Restoration Process

- [WB]: Perfection Process: Believe It's Possible → Pray Specifically →
  Cooperate with God → Character Transformed
- [EB]: Matthew 5:48 (Be ye therefore perfect)
- [EB]: 2 Corinthians 7:1 (Perfecting holiness in the fear of God)

## Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

### Think Higher - Much Higher

- Isaiah 55:8-9 - "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
  my ways, saith the LORD"
- We've been thinking too small about God's power
- We've been thinking too small about our potential in Christ

### The Faith of Jesus

- Revelation 14:12 speaks of having "the faith of Jesus"
- [RQ]: What did Jesus believe was possible? Everything! (Matt 17:20)
- [WB]: Jesus' Faith = No Impossibilities + Complete Trust in Father + Perfect
  Obedience

### Personal Commitment

- Will you expand your prayer life to match God's unlimited power?
- Will you believe that character perfection is not only possible but essential?
- Will you ask specifically for the transformation needed for the final
  generation?
