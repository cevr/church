### Introduction (6 min)

- Exodus 25:8 - God's stated purpose: dwelling with His people
- [WB]: "TABERNACLE = Blueprint for Character Restoration" (Exod 25:8)
- [RQ]: What does it mean that the God of infinite holiness desires to dwell
  with fallen humanity? (Exod 25:8)
- Theme: The tabernacle's construction reveals God's pattern for restoring His
  image in sinful hearts
- Connection to restoration: Just as God gave exact specifications for the
  physical sanctuary, He provides clear instruction for rebuilding His image in
  us
- Roadmap: Willing heart (foundation), Obedient life (mark), Glory-filled
  character (result)

### The Foundation: A Willing Heart's Sacrifice and Devotion (12 min)

#### God Initiates, We Respond

- Exodus 25:8 - "let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"
- [WB]: "God's Initiative: 'That I may DWELL among them'" (Exod 25:8)
- Key truth: God doesn't wait for our perfection—He provides the way and invites
  willing cooperation
- [RQ]: According to this verse, whose desire comes first—God's to dwell with
  us, or ours to have Him? (Exod 25:8)

#### The Willing Heart Demonstrates Sacrifice

- Exodus 35:21-22 - "every one whose heart stirred him up...came, both men and
  women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings,
  and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold"
- [WB]: "Willing Heart = COSTLY SACRIFICE" (Exod 35:21-22)
- Truth: They gave their precious jewelry—what was costly and dear to them
- This wasn't giving leftovers; this was genuine sacrifice of treasured
  possessions
- [Aside]: Like releasing grip on what we value most—time, comfort, pride,
  cherished sins. God's restoration work requires we willingly place our
  treasures on His altar, trusting His work is worth more than what we
  surrender.
- [RQ]: What "precious jewelry" of your life—habits, relationships, ambitions—is
  God asking you to willingly sacrifice for His indwelling? (Exod 35:22)
- [EB]: Mark 10:21-22 (Rich young ruler unwilling to sacrifice his treasure)

#### The Willing Heart Demonstrates Devotion

- Exodus 36:5-7 - "The people bring much more than enough...So the people were
  restrained from bringing. For the stuff they had was sufficient"
- [WB]: "Willing Heart = OVERFLOWING DEVOTION" (Exod 36:5-7)
- Truth: Their giving didn't stop at "enough"—they gave until restrained
- This reveals hearts fully devoted, not calculating minimum acceptable offering
- Connection to education/restoration: God seeks this same devotion in our
  character development—not grudging minimum compliance, but eager, overflowing
  cooperation with His transforming work
- [EGW]: "Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in
  preparing a dwelling place for the Most High." (PP 343.3)
- [RQ]: Does our cooperation with God's sanctifying work reflect "just enough"
  or overflowing devotion? (Exod 36:5-7)
- [EB]: 2 Corinthians 8:1-5 (Macedonian churches' devotion beyond their ability)

#### Summary: The Educational Foundation

- Romans 12:1 - "present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto
  God, which is your reasonable service"
- [WB]: "Foundation for Restoration: WILLING + SACRIFICIAL + DEVOTED" (Rom 12:1)
- Truth: This willing, sacrificial, devoted heart provides the foundation upon
  which God builds His dwelling place within us
- This is the starting point of True Education—willingness to unlearn attachment
  to worldly treasures and learn the value of being God's temple

### The Mark: Obedience as Evidence of God's Indwelling (13 min) [*]

#### The Sabbath Sign of Sanctification

- Exodus 31:13 - "it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations;
  that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you"
- [WB]: "SABBATH = SIGN that GOD SANCTIFIES" (Exod 31:13)
- Truth: The Sabbath isn't merely a command to keep—it's a visible sign to the
  world that God is actively sanctifying us
- This sign marks us as those in whom God dwells and works His restorative
  education
- [RQ]: How does our faithful Sabbath observance serve as evidence to others
  that God is dwelling within and sanctifying us? (Exod 31:13)
- [EB]: Ezekiel 20:12, 20 (Sabbath as perpetual sign between God and His people)

#### Exact Obedience: Proof of Divine Presence

- Exodus 39:42-43 - "According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
  children of Israel made all the work...as the LORD had commanded, even so had
  they done it: and Moses blessed them"
- [WB]: "EXACT OBEDIENCE = PROOF of God's Spirit Within" (Exod 39:42-43)
- Key insight: Their precise obedience wasn't mere human willpower—it was
  evidence that God's Spirit was actively working within them
- Connection to education: This is the learning side of restoration—accurately
  following God's revealed will because His Spirit teaches and empowers us
- [RQ]: What does Israel's exact obedience to God's specifications teach us
  about how the Holy Spirit works in our sanctification? (Exod 39:42-43)

#### Obedience Makes God's Dwelling Visible

- 1 John 3:24 - "he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
  him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath
  given us"
- [WB]: "KEEPING Commandments = VISIBLE MARK of God's Indwelling" (1 John 3:24)
- Truth: Our loyal obedience becomes the visible mark that identifies us as
  God's dwelling place
- Just as the glory cloud visibly marked the tabernacle as God's dwelling, our
  character obedience visibly marks us as His temples
- [EB]: John 14:15, 21 (Love demonstrated through obedience; obedience results
  in manifestation)
- [RQ]: In what practical ways does our obedience serve as a "mark" that reveals
  to the world that God dwells within us? (1 John 3:24)

#### The Mind Renewal Process

- Romans 12:2 - "be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the
  renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable,
  and perfect, will of God"
- [WB]: "Mind Renewal → Proves God's Will → MARKS Us as His" (Rom 12:2)
- Truth: Sanctification is God's educational process—unlearning conformity to
  the world's ways, learning His perfect will, proving it through our
  transformed choices
- This mental transformation becomes visible through our obedient choices—the
  mark of God's indwelling
- [EB]: Colossians 3:9-10 (Put off old man, renewed in knowledge after image of
  Creator)

### The Result: Glory-Filled Character (8 min)

#### The Glory Fills the Prepared Temple

- Exodus 40:34-35 - "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
  glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into
  the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
  of the LORD filled the tabernacle"
- [WB]: "Willing Heart → Marked Obedience → GLORY FILLS" (Exod 40:34-35)
- [EGW]: "With deep emotion the people beheld the token that the work of their
  hands was accepted...they murmured low, earnest words of gratitude that God
  had condescended to abide with them." (PP 349.2)
- Truth: When the preparation is complete—willing sacrifice, devoted
  cooperation, exact obedience—God's glory fills the dwelling He has been
  building
- This is the goal of True Education: a character so fully prepared through the
  unlearning of sin and learning of righteousness that God's glory can fully
  inhabit it
- [RQ]: How does this vision of God's glory filling the completed tabernacle
  shape our understanding of what God desires to accomplish in our character?
  (Exod 40:34-35)

#### Christ: The Perfect Example

- John 1:14 - "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld
  his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and
  truth"
- [WB]: "Christ = Perfect MARK of God Dwelling in Humanity" (John 1:14)
- Greek connection: "dwelt" = literally "tabernacled"
- Truth: Christ's life was the perfect demonstration of God dwelling fully in
  human flesh—willing sacrifice, complete devotion, exact obedience,
  glory-filled character
- He is both our pattern and our power for this same restoration
- [EB]: Philippians 2:6-8 (Christ's willing sacrifice and obedient devotion unto
  death)
- [RQ]: How does Christ's perfect example of God "tabernacling" in humanity give
  us hope for our own character restoration? (John 1:14)

#### The Ultimate Purpose: Eternal Dwelling

- 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the
  glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even
  as by the Spirit of the Lord"
- [WB]: "Beholding His Glory → Changed to His Image → From Glory to Glory" (2
  Cor 3:18)
- Truth: The entire restoration process—willing heart, marked obedience,
  glory-filled character—is preparing us to dwell eternally with God, fully
  restored to His image
- This is why character preparation matters urgently in these last days—God is
  completing His sanctuary work in His people

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

#### Summary of the Blueprint

- God's pattern revealed: Willing, sacrificial, devoted heart → Marked by exact
  obedience → Filled with His glory
- [WB]: "The MARK of God's Temple: LOYAL OBEDIENCE" (Exod 31:13, 1 John 3:24)
- This isn't merely outward conformity—it's the visible evidence that God's
  Spirit dwells within, actively sanctifying and restoring His image in us

#### The Character Focus

- Our obedience to God's commands—especially the sign of the Sabbath—becomes the
  visible mark to the world that we are His dwelling place
- This mark is being formed through True Education: unlearning the world's ways,
  learning God's ways, proving His perfect will through transformed choices

#### The Urgent Appeal

- [RQ]: What area of your life is God asking for willing sacrifice today—what
  "precious jewelry" must you place on His altar? (Exod 35:22)
- [RQ]: Is your cooperation with His sanctifying work characterized by "just
  enough" or overflowing devotion? (Exod 36:5-7)
- [RQ]: What specific aspect of obedience will you surrender this week as a
  visible mark that God dwells within you? (Exod 31:13)
- [WB]: "Let My OBEDIENCE Mark Me as YOUR TEMPLE" (Exod 25:8)

#### Final Hope

- [EGW]: "So Christ set up His tabernacle in the midst of our human encampment.
  He pitched His tent by the side of the tents of men, that He might dwell among
  us, and make us familiar with His divine character and life." (DA 23.3)
- As Christ's perfect obedience marked Him as the Father's dwelling place, our
  loyal obedience—empowered by His Spirit—marks us as His living temples
- The same glory that filled the completed tabernacle will fill our completed
  characters when His restorative work is finished
- God is building His dwelling place in you—will you offer willing sacrifice,
  devoted cooperation, and marked obedience so His glory may fill your
  character?
