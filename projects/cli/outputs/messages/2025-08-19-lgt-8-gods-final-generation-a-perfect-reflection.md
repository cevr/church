### Introduction (5 min)

- The core issue of the Great Controversy: Satan's charge that God's law is
  unjust and cannot be kept by fallen beings. (Gen 3:1-5; Isa 14:13-14)
- God's plan culminates in a final generation that, through Christ, will fully
  vindicate His character and government.
- This is not about human achievement, but divine restoration.
- Central Verse Introduction: Rev 14:12 presents the two key identifiers of this
  group: unwavering obedience and total reliance on Jesus.
- [WB]: The Great Controversy Question: Can God's Law Be Kept? -> Final
  Generation's Answer: YES, through Christ (Rev 14:12).

### Main Section 1: A Prophetic Portrait of the Saints (12 min)

- **Foundation Text:** Revelation 14:1-5 - A symbolic description of the
  character of those who stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion.
- **Verse 1: Identity and Allegiance**
  - They have the "Father's name written in their foreheads."
  - [RQ]: Is this a literal mark or a description of a mind and character fully
    conformed to God? (cf. Deut 6:8, Heb 8:10)
  - [WB]: Forehead = Mind/Character. Father's Name = His Character (Ex 34:5-7).
    -> A people who think and act like God.
  - [EB]: Revelation 7:1-4 (The sealing is a work of settling into the truth,
    both intellectually and spiritually, so they cannot be moved).
- **Verse 4: Purity and Devotion**
  - "Not defiled with women; for they are virgins." - Symbolic of spiritual
    purity, undivided allegiance from Babylon and its daughters (Rev 17:5).
  - "Follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth." - Unconditional surrender and
    obedience, regardless of the cost.
- **Verse 5: Integrity and Blamelessness**
  - "In their mouth was found no guile." - Absolute honesty and truthfulness,
    reflecting Jesus (1 Pet 2:22).
  - "They are without fault before the throne of God."
  - [RQ]: How can sinful beings be "without fault"? Is this a legal declaration
    or a description of their actual, restored character? (Jude 1:24)
  - [EB]: Zephaniah 3:13 (The remnant of Israel "shall not do iniquity, nor
    speak lies...")

### Main Section 2: The Motive and the Method for Restoration [*] (12 min)

#### A. The Hope That Purifies

- **Foundation Text:** 1 John 3:2-3
- Verse 2: The ultimate goal of our salvation. "We shall be like him; for we
  shall see him as he is."
  - This is the final step in the restoration of God's image. (Gen 1:27)
- Verse 3: The practical effect of this hope. "Every man that hath this hope in
  him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
  - [RQ]: How does the genuine hope of Christ’s soon return become an active
    agent in our character development today?
  - [Aside]: An artisan restoring a masterpiece doesn't just wish it were fixed.
    They meticulously apply the right techniques day by day. Our hope in
    Christ's return motivates us to cooperate daily with the Master Restorer.
  - [WB]: Hope (Seeing Jesus) -> Motivation -> Purification Process (Cooperation
    with Spirit).

#### B. The Method for Attaining His Character

- **Foundation Text:** Philippians 2:5-8
- Verse 5: The divine instruction. "Let this mind be in you, which was also in
  Christ Jesus."
  - This is the core of "True Education"—unlearning self-centeredness and
    learning Christ's mindset.
- Verses 6-8: The definition of Christ's mind.
  - A mind of humility (emptied Himself).
  - A mind of service (took the form of a servant).
  - A mind of ultimate obedience (obedient unto death).
  - [WB]: Diagram Flow: Equal with God -> Made Himself of No Reputation ->
    Servant -> Obedient unto Death = The Mind of Christ.
  - [EGW]: "When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His
    people, then He will come to claim them as His own." (COL 69.1)
  - [EB]: Isaiah 53:7 (He was oppressed... yet he opened not his mouth - a
    perfect demonstration of this selfless mind).

### Main Section 3: The Standard and the Vindication (10 min)

- **Foundation Text:** Matthew 5:48 - "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
  Father which is in heaven is perfect."
- **Understanding Biblical Perfection:**
  - Not an impossible demand for absolute, Adamic sinlessness in nature.
  - Greek "teleios": complete, mature, having reached the end goal.
  - A perfection of love, intent, and allegiance. A heart fully surrendered.
  - [RQ]: In light of Philippians 2, is this perfection more about a state of
    arrival or a state of complete surrender to God's will?
- **The Link to the Investigative Judgment:**
  - This perfected character is the final evidence presented in the heavenly
    court. (Dan 7:9-10)
  - It demonstrates to the universe that God's grace can restore fallen beings
    to perfect harmony with His law.
  - [WB]: Final Generation's Character -> Heavenly Court Evidence -> Vindication
    of God's Government.
  - [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (The "cleansing of the sanctuary" involves a final work of
    purification in the hearts of God's people on earth).
  - [EB]: Malachi 3:2-3 ("But who may abide the day of his coming? ...for he is
    like a refiner's fire... and he shall purify the sons of Levi...")

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Recapitulation: God's purpose is to have a people who fully reflect the
  character of His Son (Rev 14:1-5).
- This is achieved by embracing the hope of His coming (1 John 3:2-3) and
  allowing the "mind of Christ" to be formed in us (Phil 2:5).
- This is the high calling of God (Matt 5:48) and the ultimate purpose of the
  plan of salvation—the restoration of His image in humanity.
- This is not a cause for discouragement, but an invitation to a deeper
  relationship of surrender with Christ. He promises to accomplish this work in
  us (Phil 1:6).
- [RQ]: Are you willing to surrender every part of your character to the
  Refiner's fire, so that His image may be perfectly reproduced in you?
- Appeal: Let us cease striving in our own strength and yield completely,
  allowing Him to complete the educational process of restoring His perfect,
  loving character within us, preparing us for His soon return.
