### **Introduction (5 min)**

- Start with a question: Is God's law a set of arbitrary rules, or is it a
  revelation of who He is?
- The great controversy began with an attack on God's law and His character.
  Satan claimed the law was restrictive and couldn't be kept.
- This study explores the law not as a burden, but as the foundation of God's
  government and the framework for our restoration.
- [RQ]: Why would a government of perfect love _require_ a foundation of
  unchanging law? (Ex 20)
- Thesis: The law is a transcript of God's character, and our relationship to it
  reveals our relationship to Him.

### **Main Section 1: The Eternal Transcript (12 min)**

- **The Law Given at Sinai: A Foundation for Relationship**
  - Exodus 20:1-2 - God introduces Himself first as Redeemer ("brought thee out
    of... bondage"). The law is given to a people already saved.
  - Exodus 20:3-17 - A quick overview of the two tables: Duty to God (1-4) and
    Duty to Man (5-10).
  - [Aside]: A nation's constitution isn't a burden; it's the framework that
    protects freedom and defines the nation's values. God's law is the
    constitution of His eternal kingdom, designed for our happiness and
    protection.

- **The Law's Divine Attributes: A Reflection of God**
  - Psalm 19:7-9 - Unpack the descriptors of the law.
    - `Perfect, converting the soul`: The law is the standard for the
      educational process of restoration.
    - `Sure, making wise the simple`: It is a reliable guide.
    - `Right, rejoicing the heart`: True joy is found within its boundaries.
    - `Pure, enlightening the eyes`: It reveals truth and error.
  - [WB]: Two Columns: **Law's Attributes (Ps 19)** -> **God's Character**
    - Perfect -> He is Perfect (Matt 5:48)
    - Holy -> He is Holy (Lev 19:2)
    - Just -> He is Just (Deut 32:4)
    - Good -> He is Good (Ps 34:8)
  - [EGW]: "The law of God is as sacred as God Himself. It is a revelation of
    His will, a transcript of His character, the expression of divine love and
    wisdom." (PP 52.2)
  - [EB]: Daniel 7:25 (Prophetic context for the historical attack on God's law
    by the "little horn" power).

### **Main Section 2: Christ, the Law's Vindicator [*] (12 min)**

- **Christ Did Not Abolish, He Magnified**
  - Matthew 5:17 - "Think not that I am come to destroy the law... but to
    fulfil."
  - [WB]: "Fulfill" (Gk. _pleroo_) = To fill up, to bring to full expression, to
    live out its true meaning.
  - [RQ]: If Christ perfectly kept the law, what does His life _teach_ us about
    the law's true spiritual meaning beyond just the words? (Matt 5:17-19)
  - Matthew 5:21-22, 27-28 - Christ applies the law to the thoughts and intents
    of the heart, restoring its spiritual depth. This is _True Education_ in the
    principles of the kingdom.
  - [EB]: Isaiah 42:21 ("He will magnify the law, and make it honourable.") - A
    Messianic prophecy Christ fulfilled.

- **The Law Established by Faith**
  - Romans 3:31 - "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
    we establish the law."
  - Faith in Christ leads to a transformation that brings us _into_ harmony with
    the law, not freedom _from_ it.
  - Romans 7:12, 14 - "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
    just, and good... the law is spiritual."
  - [Aside]: The law is like a mirror (James 1:23-25). It shows us the dirt on
    our face (sin) but cannot clean it. For that, we need the water and soap
    (Christ's blood and Spirit). It reveals our need for a Savior.

### **Main Section 3: The Law in the Heart and in the End (10 min)**

- **The New Covenant Promise: An Internalized Standard**
  - Jeremiah 31:33 - "But this shall be the covenant... I will put my law in
    their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."
  - This is the ultimate goal of salvation: the restoration of God's image and
    principles within us, not just as an external code.
  - [WB]: Diagram: Stone Tablets (Old) -> Cross -> Heart (New Covenant - Jer
    31:33) = Character Restoration
  - [EB]: Romans 8:3-4 (What the law couldn't do—provide power—God did by
    sending Christ, so the law's righteousness is fulfilled _in_ us who walk
    after the Spirit).

- **The Final Test: A People Identified by the Law**
  - Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
    keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
  - This is the identifying mark of God's remnant people in the final crisis.
  - [RQ]: According to Revelation 14:12, why is keeping the commandments linked
    so closely with having the faith _of_ Jesus, not just faith _in_ Jesus?
  - The "faith of Jesus" is a saving faith that produces obedience. It is the
    very faith He lived by.
  - [EB]: James 2:10-12 (The law is a unified whole, and it is the "law of
    liberty" by which we will be judged, connecting it to the Investigative
    Judgment).
  - [EB]: Deuteronomy 6:5-9 (The law was always intended to be a part of life
    and education, written on the heart and mind).

### **Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)**

- Summary: The law is not an abolished relic. It is a perfect transcript of
  God's character, the foundation of His government, magnified by Christ, and
  the sign of His end-time people.
- Satan’s lie is that the law is a burden. God’s truth is that it is the
  framework for liberty and love.
- The critical question is not "Can I keep the law?" but "Will I allow Christ to
  live out His law-abiding life in me?" (Gal 2:20).
- This is the essence of True Education: unlearning our selfish ways and
  learning His ways, allowing His Spirit to write His principles on our hearts.
- Appeal: Surrender your heart to Christ today. Invite Him to fulfill His new
  covenant promise in you—to replace your resistance with a love for His law and
  to restore His perfect character in you, preparing you for His soon return.
  (John 14:15).
