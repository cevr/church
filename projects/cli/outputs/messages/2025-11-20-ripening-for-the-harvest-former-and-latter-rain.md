### Introduction: The Agricultural Metaphor (5 min)

*   **Text:** James 5:7 - "Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."
*   **Context:** Establish the agricultural reality of Palestine. The "Early" (Former) rain fell at planting time (Autumn) to germinate the seed. The "Latter" rain fell before harvest (Spring) to ripen the grain.
*   **Concept:** Introduce the spiritual parallel. Just as nature requires two rains to produce a harvest, the Christian experience requires two distinct workings of the Holy Spirit to restore the image of God in man.
*   **[WB]: Draw Diagram: Seed (Germination) -> Stalk (Growth) -> Full Head (Ripening). Label: 'Former Rain' at Start, 'Latter Rain' at Finish.**
*   **[RQ]:** Why does James use the metaphor of "patience" regarding this rain? What does that imply about the *process* of character development vs. instantaneous change? (James 5:7)

### Section 1: The Former Rain - Foundation & Germination (7 min)

*   **Text:** Joel 2:23 - "...he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month."
    *   **Word Study:** Note the margin reading for "moderately" in KJV is often "according to righteousness" or "a teacher of righteousness."
    *   **Application:** The Spirit begins as a Teacher.
*   **Historical vs. Personal:**
    *   *Historical:* The outpouring at Pentecost (Acts 2) was the Former Rain for the Gospel dispensation.
    *   *Personal:* The Former Rain is the work of the Spirit at *conversion*. It breaks up the fallow ground of the heart (Jeremiah 4:3) and causes the seed of truth to sprout.
*   **[EGW]:** 'The latter rain, falling near the close of the season, ripens the grain and prepares it for the sickle. The Lord employs these operations of nature to represent the work of the Holy Spirit.' (TM 506.1)
*   **[EB]:** Acts 2:1-4 (Pentecost). Note that the disciples had been in a school of *unlearning* self-sufficiency and *learning* dependence on Christ for 10 days prior.
*   **Crucial Point:** Without the germination (Former Rain), there can be no growth. Many are waiting for the Latter Rain (power) without having experienced the Former Rain (conversion/surrender).
*   **[WB]: Key Principle: You cannot ripen a crop that never germinated.**

### Section 2: The Process - Daily Growth & Restoration (8 min) [*]

*   **Text:** Mark 4:28 - "For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear."
    *   **Theme:** This section covers the time *between* the rains. This is the life of sanctification—the "True Education."
*   **Text:** Hosea 6:3 - "Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain..."
    *   **"Follow on to know":** This implies a progressive education.
*   **The Education of Restoration:**
    *   Salvation is the restoration of God's image. This happens daily.
    *   **Unlearning:** We must "put off" the old man (Eph 4:22). This is unlearning the habits of sin and selfishness.
    *   **Learning:** We "put on" the new man (Eph 4:24). This is learning the habits of heaven—obedience, patience, love.
*   **[Aside]:** Imagine a garden that receives the early rain but is then neglected. Weeds (sinful habits) grow up with the wheat. If the farmer does not weed (daily repentance/submission), the harvest is ruined. The Spirit aids us in this daily "weeding."
*   **[RQ]:** If we are cherishing known sin today, refusing to "unlearn" our worldly ways, what effect will the Latter Rain have on us? Can it ripen a character that looks like the world? (Ref: Gal 6:7-8)
*   **[WB]: List: Daily Application of Former Rain: 1. Searching the Scriptures (Eating), 2. Prayer (Breathing), 3. Obedience (Exercise).**
*   **[EB]:** Psalm 72:6 - "He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass." The Spirit's work on the character is often quiet, restorative, and constant, not just spectacular events.

### Section 3: The Latter Rain - Ripening for Harvest (5 min)

*   **Text:** Zechariah 10:1 - "Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain..."
    *   **Timing:** When is the "time of the latter rain"? It is the end of the age, preparatory to the harvest.
*   **Function of the Latter Rain:**
    *   To *ripen* the grain (bring character to maturity/perfection).
    *   To prepare the church for the "Loud Cry" (giving the Gospel with final power).
    *   To strengthen God's people to stand through the time of trouble without a mediator.
*   **Text:** Acts 3:19 - "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."
    *   **The Connection:** The "refreshing" (Latter Rain) is linked to the "blotting out of sins" (Investigative Judgment).
    *   **[WB]: Diagram: Earthly Sanctuary -> Day of Atonement -> High Priest exits -> Blesses People. (Parallel: Jesus in Most Holy Place -> Blotting out Sin -> Sends Latter Rain).**
*   **[RQ]:** According to Acts 3:19, can we receive the "refreshing" if our sins are not currently being repented of and sent to the Sanctuary for blotting out?
*   **[EGW]:** 'Unless we are daily advancing in the exemplification of the active Christian virtues, we shall not recognize the manifestations of the Holy Spirit in the latter rain. It may be falling on hearts all around us, but we shall not discern or receive it.' (TM 507.1)
*   **[EB]:** Revelation 18:1 - The earth is lightened with His glory. This is the result of the Latter Rain—the character of God fully reproduced in His people and demonstrated to the world.

### Conclusion: The Urgency of "Now" (5 min)

*   **Summary:** The Former Rain (Conversion) starts the work; the Daily Indwelling (Sanctification/Education) continues the work; the Latter Rain (Refreshing) finishes the work.
*   **The Danger:** Waiting for a future power to fix a present lack of consecration.
*   **Actionable Steps (Restoration of Image):**
    *   **1. Verify Germination:** Have you truly surrendered to Christ? (The Former Rain).
    *   **2. Cooperate with Growth:** Are you actively "unlearning" impatience, pride, and selfishness through the Word today?
    *   **3. Pray for Rain:** Specifically ask for the Spirit to reveal defects of character *now* so they can be removed before the harvest.
*   **[Aside]:** A harvest is never surprising to the farmer. He knows what will be harvested based on what he planted and tended. Our character at the Second Coming will be the result of what we are cultivating right now.
*   **Closing Appeal:** We are living in the time of the "Latter Rain." Let us not miss the showers because our vessels are turned upside down by the world.
*   **Closing Text:** Hosea 10:12 - "Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you."
