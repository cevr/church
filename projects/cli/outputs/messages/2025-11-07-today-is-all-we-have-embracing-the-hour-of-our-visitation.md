## Introduction (6 minutes)

### Opening Context

- Luke 19:41-44 - "And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over
  it, Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the
  things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes...
  because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation."

- [RQ]: What made Christ weep over Jerusalem? What did they fail to recognize in
  their "day"? (Luke 19:42,44)

- [WB]: Key Phrase: "TIME OF VISITATION" = God's appointed moment of
  mercy/opportunity

### The Universal Human Tendency

- We all naturally live as though tomorrow is guaranteed
- We plan, postpone, delay spiritual decisions
- "I'll deal with that conviction... tomorrow"
- "I'll make things right... soon"

- [Aside]: Like a student who has an entire semester to complete an assignment,
  we often assume we have unlimited time for spiritual preparation. But
  graduation day comes whether the work is finished or not, and no extensions
  are granted beyond the grave.

### Central Truth Introduction

- The biblical principle: TODAY is the only time we truly possess
- Tomorrow is never promised in Scripture
- Our visitation—God's special call to our hearts—comes NOW

---

## Section 1: The Peril of Presuming on Tomorrow (6 minutes)

### The Folly of Assumed Tomorrows

**Biblical Foundation:**

- James 4:13-15 - "Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into
  such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
  Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is
  even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. For
  that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that."

- [WB]: Diagram: LIFE = A VAPOR (James 4:14) - appears → vanishes (no guaranteed
  tomorrow)

- [RQ]: According to James 4:14, what is the fundamental problem with planning
  as though tomorrow is certain?

**The Danger of Spiritual Procrastination:**

- Proverbs 27:1 - "Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
  day may bring forth."

- [EB]: Ecclesiastes 12:1 (Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth - the
  urgency of not delaying)

- Luke 12:16-20 - The Rich Fool's fatal assumption: "Soul, thou hast much goods
  laid up for many years"
  - God's response: "This night thy soul shall be required of thee"
  - He presumed on time he did not have
  - His "tomorrow" never came

- [WB]: Question: What spiritual preparation are you postponing until
  "tomorrow"?

**The Hardening Process of Delay:**

- Hebrews 3:13 - "But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
  any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin."

- Key Truth for Restoration from Hebrews 3:13: Each day of delay allows sin to
  further deceive and harden the heart

- [EGW]: "Many are quieting a troubled conscience with the thought that they can
  change a course of evil when they choose... They think that after casting
  their influence on the side of the great rebel, in a moment of utmost
  extremity, when danger compasses them about, they may change leaders. But this
  is not so easily done." (PP 268.2)

- The educational reality: Each "tomorrow" decision trains the will to resist
  God's voice
- Unlearning patterns of delay becomes progressively harder

---

## Section 2: The Divine Urgency of "Today" (6 minutes) [*]

### God's Repeated Emphasis on Immediacy

**The Pattern Throughout Scripture:**

- 2 Corinthians 6:2 - "For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and
  in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted
  time; behold, now is the day of salvation."

- [WB]: Scripture Emphasis: NOW = ACCEPTED TIME / NOW = DAY OF SALVATION (2 Cor
  6:2)

- [RQ]: Why does Paul repeat "now" twice in 2 Corinthians 6:2? What urgency is
  being communicated?

**The "Today" of Hebrews:**

- Hebrews 3:7-8 - "Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear
  his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation)"

- Hebrews 3:15 - "While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
  your hearts"

- Hebrews 4:7 - "Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
  after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden
  not your hearts"

- [WB]: Count: "TODAY" repeated 4 times in Hebrews 3-4 (Divine emphasis on
  present action)

- Pattern: God consistently limits the time of opportunity to "today"
- Not yesterday (past is gone)
- Not tomorrow (not promised)
- Only today is in our hands

**Why "Today" Matters in Restoration:**

- Romans 13:11 - "And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake
  out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."

- The process of True Education—unlearning sin, learning righteousness—requires
  time
- Character formation happens through daily choices, repeated consistently
- Each "today" builds the habits that determine eternal destiny

- [EB]: Philippians 2:12-13 (Work out your salvation with fear and
  trembling—today's cooperation with God's work)

---

## Section 3: Recognizing Our Time of Visitation (6 minutes)

### What Is a "Time of Visitation"?

**The Concept in Scripture:**

- Luke 19:44 - "And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within
  thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou
  knewest not the time of thy visitation."

- [WB]: Definition: VISITATION = God's appointed time when He specially draws
  near with mercy, light, and opportunity for salvation

**Historical Example - Jerusalem's Missed Moment:**

- Luke 19:41-42 - Jesus wept because they failed to recognize their day
- They had the Messiah physically present
- The prophetic time (Daniel 9:24-27) was fulfilled
- Yet they were occupied with political hopes, traditions, earthly concerns

- [EB]: Daniel 9:25-26 (The prophetic timeline Jerusalem should have
  understood—70 weeks prophecy)

- Their "tomorrow" thinking: "We'll consider this Jesus later... after the
  Romans... after Passover... when it's more convenient"
- Their tomorrow never came—70 AD destruction

- [RQ]: If Jerusalem, with prophecy and the physical presence of Christ, missed
  their visitation, how careful must we be in our day? (Luke 19:44)

**Our Time of Visitation:**

- Isaiah 55:6 - "Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while
  he is near"

- The phrase "while he may be found" implies there is a limited window
- Times when God is especially near with conviction, light, mercy
- These moments may be:
  - Personal (conviction during a message, study, trial)
  - Prophetic (living in the antitypical Day of Atonement—since 1844)
  - Providential (specific circumstances bringing you to decision points)

### How to Respond to Today's Visitation

**Immediate Action Required:**

- Matthew 24:42 - "Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth
  come."

- Matthew 24:44 - "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think
  not the Son of man cometh."

- [WB]: Action Steps (Education for Restoration Based on Matt 24:42,44):
  1. Unlearn: The habit of spiritual procrastination
  2. Learn: Immediate response to Holy Spirit conviction

**Practical Steps for Embracing "Today":**

Based on the scriptures studied, consider these steps in the educational journey
of restoring God's image:

1. **Unlearn**: The assumption that tomorrow will come
   - Recognize each morning as a gift, not a guarantee (Lam 3:22-23)
   - Train the mind away from "I'll deal with this later" thinking

2. **Learn/Apply**: Immediate obedience to known duty
   - When conviction comes—act on it TODAY (Heb 3:15)
   - When truth is revealed—embrace it NOW (2 Cor 6:2)
   - When reconciliation is needed—pursue it IMMEDIATELY (Matt 5:23-24)

- [EB]: Matthew 5:23-24 (Leave your gift—reconcile immediately, don't wait)

3. **Daily Character Building**:
   - Proverbs 4:18 - "But the path of the just is as the shining light, that
     shineth more and more unto the perfect day."
   - Each today's choice builds tomorrow's character
   - But we can only act in the present moment we have

- [RQ]: Based on Proverbs 4:18, how does consistent obedience TODAY prepare us
  for the "perfect day" ahead?

**The Urgency of the Investigative Judgment Era:**

- We live in the antitypical Day of Atonement (Dan 8:14—since 1844)
- Cases are being decided in heaven's court NOW
- The door of mercy will close (Rev 22:11)
- No one knows when their individual probation ends

- [EGW]: "Says the prophet: 'Who may abide the day of His coming? and who shall
  stand when He appeareth? for He is like a refiner's fire.' Malachi 3:2. Those
  who live upon the earth when the intercession of Christ shall cease in the
  sanctuary above are to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator.
  Their robes must be spotless, their characters must be purified from sin by
  the blood of sprinkling. Through the grace of God and their own diligent
  effort they must be conquerors in the battle with evil." (GC 425.1)

- [EB]: Revelation 22:11 (Final decree—no more change possible after probation
  closes)

### Living with Eternal Perspective

**The Connection to Final Events:**

- Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
  keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."

- Character fit for eternity is formed TODAY
- The final generation must develop patient endurance—habit by habit, day by day
- No cramming for the final exam—character is built through daily choices

- [WB]: Timeline: TODAY'S choices → Character formation → Readiness for final
  events → Eternity

- [Aside]: A master musician doesn't learn their instrument the night before the
  concert. Years of daily practice—scales, exercises, pieces—develop the skill
  displayed on stage. Similarly, the character that will stand in earth's final
  hour is being formed or neglected in today's seemingly small choices.

## Conclusion and Appeal (6 minutes)

### Returning to the Weeping Savior

- Luke 19:41-44 - Jesus wept over those who missed their visitation
- His heart breaks for every soul who presumes on tomorrow
- He sees the end from the beginning

- [RQ]: Is Jesus weeping over our complacency? Over our "tomorrow" thinking?
  (Luke 19:41-44)

### The Mercy of Divine Urgency

- God's emphasis on "today" is not harshness—it's mercy
- He knows what we don't: tomorrow may never come
- He knows how hardening works through delay
- He calls us NOW because NOW we can still respond

- [WB]: GOD'S "TODAY" = MERCY (not threat) - He knows tomorrow isn't promised

**Final Appeal:**

The scriptures we've studied reveal an unmistakable truth: God has given you
TODAY. Not yesterday—that's gone. Not tomorrow—that's not promised. Only this
present moment.

- Hebrews 3:15 - "While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
  your hearts"

What is God's Spirit impressing on your heart RIGHT NOW?

- Is there a sin to confess—TODAY?
- A relationship to restore—TODAY?
- A habit to break—TODAY?
- A truth to embrace—TODAY?
- A surrender to make—TODAY?

This may be your time of visitation. This message, this moment, this conviction
you feel—this is God drawing near with mercy. Will you recognize it?

Jerusalem said, "Tomorrow, after the feast, after the Romans leave, when it's
more convenient." Their tomorrow never came. The temple was destroyed. The
opportunity was lost.

The Rich Fool said, "Tomorrow I'll have many years." God said, "This night thy
soul shall be required."

The foolish virgins said, "Tomorrow we'll get oil." But the Bridegroom came, the
door closed, and their tomorrow was too late (Matt 25:1-13).

- [EB]: Matthew 25:1-13 (The foolish virgins' tragic "tomorrow" - door closed
  before they returned)

**Personal Invitation:**

2 Corinthians 6:2 - "Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of
salvation."

Whatever God has been speaking to your heart during this study—don't say
tomorrow. Your tomorrow is not promised. Your visitation is NOW.

Will you, by God's grace, make today count for eternity? Will you embrace the
character transformation He offers—beginning this very moment?

Let us pray, recognizing that even this moment of prayer is a gift, an
opportunity, a visitation that may not come again in the same way.

[Close with prayer acknowledging God's mercy in giving us "today," asking for
grace to respond immediately to His voice, and strength to live each day as
though it might be our last opportunity for preparation.]
