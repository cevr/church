Introduction (6 min)

- Need/Question:
  - 2 Corinthians 6:2 — The Gospel’s timeframe is “now,” not “someday.”
  - [RQ]: If salvation is “today,” what assumptions about “tomorrow” must we
    unlearn? (2 Cor 6:2)
  - [WB]: Key Terms: TODAY / NOW (2 Cor 6:2; Heb 3:15)
- Biblical frame:
  - James 4:13-15 — Life is a vapor; “If the Lord will…”
  - [RQ]: How does acknowledging “If the Lord will” reshape our daily
    priorities? (Jas 4:15)
  - [WB]: Define “Visitation”: God draws near in mercy/testing/judgment (Lk
    19:44)
- Aim:
  - Key Truth: God’s restoration works through timely invitations; delayed
    obedience risks permanent loss.

Section 1 (6 min) – Christ’s Visitation and Missed Opportunity

- Luke 19:41-44 — “Because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.”
  - Key Truth for Restoration: Recognize and respond when Christ draws near.
  - [RQ]: What blinded Jerusalem to her “day”? Tradition? Presumption? Delay?
    (Lk 19:41-44)
  - [WB]: Visitation = Light Offered → Decision → Destiny (Lk 19:44; Jn
    12:35-36)
  - [EGW]: “He wept for the doomed thousands of Jerusalem—because she knew not
    the time of her visitation.” (DA 587.2)
  - [Aside]: A doorbell ignored long enough stops ringing; opportunity passes.
    Mercy calls are time-sensitive.
  - [EB]: 1 Peter 2:12 (Day of visitation = God’s inspection/mercy revealing His
    work)
  - [EB]: Revelation 3:20 (Christ knocks—personal visitation, requires immediate
    opening)
- Action Steps:
  - Unlearn: Waiting for a “more convenient season” to surrender (Acts 24:25
    example).
  - Learn/Apply: Prompt obedience when light/conviction comes (Jn 12:35-36 “walk
    while ye have the light”).
  - [WB]: Action: 1) Identify current light 2) Decide today 3) Act in faith (Lk
    19:44; Jn 12:36)

Section 2 (6 min) [*] – “Today”: Hearing vs. Hardening

- Hebrews 3:7-15; Psalm 95 — “Today… harden not your hearts.”
  - Key Truth for Restoration: The heart is educated daily—by hearing
    (softening) or resisting (hardening).
  - [WB]: Hear → Believe → Obey → Enter Rest (Heb 3:7-11; 4:1-2)
  - [RQ]: What forms “hardening” take today—delay, distraction, rationalization?
    (Heb 3:13)
  - [Aside]: Callus vs. clay—repeated resistance forms calluses; early response
    keeps the heart moldable.
  - James 4:13-15; Proverbs 27:1 — “Boast not thyself of to morrow.”
  - [EB]: Genesis 6:3 (God’s Spirit will not always strive—limits to delay)
- Action Steps:
  - Unlearn: “I’ll obey when I feel ready.” (Heb 3:13 deceitfulness of sin)
  - Learn/Apply: Daily exhort one another; make decisions at first conviction
    (Heb 3:13, 15).
  - [WB]: Daily Practice: Word + Prayer + Immediate obedience (Heb 3:13-15)

Section 3 (6 min) [*] – Judgment Hour and the Shut Door

- Revelation 14:7 — “The hour of His judgment is come.”
  - Key Truth for Restoration: Heaven’s review is present-tense; character is
    weighed now.
  - [EGW]: “The judgment is now passing in the sanctuary above… soon—none know
    how soon—it will pass to the cases of the living.” (GC 490.2)
  - [WB]: Draw: Cross → Holy Place → Most Holy (1844) → Close of Probation (Dan
    8:14; Rev 22:11)
  - Matthew 25:10-13 — “The door was shut… Watch therefore.”
  - [RQ]: If the “door” can close unexpectedly, what must readiness look like
    today? (Matt 25:10-13)
  - [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (2300 days: cleansing = judgment-phase; urgency of
    preparation)
  - [EB]: Revelation 22:11 (Final fixation of character—close of probation)
- Action Steps:
  - Unlearn: Thinking “mercy = endless opportunity” (Matt 25:11-12).
  - Learn/Apply: Watchfulness in daily faithfulness; oil = character formed by
    Spirit now (Matt 25:3-4).
  - Link to Education: True Education prepares character to stand when the door
    shuts (Heb 12:14).

Section 4 (6 min) – Practicing “Today” Faith: Steps for Readiness

- John 12:35-36 — “Walk while ye have the light… believe in the light.”
  - Key Truth for Restoration: Light obeyed increases light; light neglected
    becomes darkness.
  - Matthew 24:44 — “Be ye also ready…”
  - [RQ]: What “known duty” am I postponing that’s hardening my heart? (Jn
    12:35; Matt 24:44)
  - [EB]: Acts 17:30-31 (God “now commandeth all men… to repent” because He has
    appointed a day)
- Concrete Steps (derived from texts):
  - 1. Immediate Surrender: Confess and forsake known sin today (Prov 28:13; 1
       Jn 1:9).
  - 2. Reconcile Now: Make wrongs right promptly (Matt 5:23-24).
  - 3. Practice Watchfulness: Daily Word/prayer/service with prompt obedience
       (Matt 24:42; Heb 3:15).
  - 4. Mission Now: Share present truth while the door of mercy is open (Rev
       14:7; Matt 24:14).
  - [WB]: Action Steps (Education for Restoration) — Unlearn delay; Learn prompt
    obedience; Repeat daily (2 Cor 6:2; Heb 3:15)
  - [EGW]: “When the character of Christ shall be perfectly reproduced in His
    people, then He will come to claim them as His own.” (COL 69.1)
