### **Introduction (5 min)**

- Welcome and opening prayer.
- The question of what happens after death is one of humanity's oldest.
- Nearly every world religion and philosophy is built upon one of two answers.
- [RQ]: Is it possible that the most widespread belief about death is actually
  based on the very first lie told to humanity?
- This isn't a minor doctrine; understanding this truth is a shield against
  Satan's most powerful end-time deceptions.
- Our study goal: To let the Bible, and the Bible alone, define death and our
  hope for the future. This is part of our "True Education" in unlearning
  foundational error.

### **Section 1: The Origin of the Lie (8 min)**

- **The Setting:** The Garden of Eden, a test of loyalty and belief in God's
  Word.
- **God's Clear Command & Warning:** Genesis 2:16-17
  - God sets a clear boundary.
  - The consequence is explicit: "thou shalt surely die."
- **Satan's Direct Contradiction:** Genesis 3:1-4
  - He first casts doubt on God's character ("Yea, hath God said...?").
  - Then, the first lie is spoken: "Ye shall not surely die." (v. 4)
- [WB]: Draw two columns.
  - **God's Word:** "Thou shalt surely die" (Gen 2:17) -> TRUTH
  - **Satan's Word:** "Ye shall not surely die" (Gen 3:4) -> THE LIE
- [RQ]: Why would Satan's first lie be about the consequence of sin? (Hint: If
  there's no real death, is sin really that serious? Does God's law have
  authority?)
- [EGW]: 'The theory of the immortality of the soul was one of those false
  doctrines that Rome, borrowing from paganism, incorporated into the religion
  of Christendom. Martin Luther classed it with the "monstrous fables that form
  part of the Roman dunghill of decretals."' (GC 549.1)
- [EB]: John 8:44 (Jesus identifies Satan as the father of lies).

### **Section 2: The Biblical Definition of Death (12 min) [*]**

- **The Nature of Man:** How were we made?
  - Genesis 2:7 - "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
    breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
    soul."
  - [WB]: Equation: Dust (Body) + Breath of Life (Spirit from God) = Living Soul
    (A living being).
  - The "soul" is not a separate, conscious entity; it is the _result_ of the
    union of body and breath.
  - [EB]: Ecclesiastes 12:7 (At death, the process reverses: dust returns to
    earth, spirit/breath returns to God who gave it).
- **The Condition in Death:** What does the Bible say happens?
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 - "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead
    know not any thing... their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
    perished."
  - Psalm 146:4 - "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
    very day his thoughts perish."
  - [RQ]: If thoughts perish and the dead know nothing, can they be in heaven
    praising God or in hell being tormented? How does this simple truth
    dismantle so many popular ideas?
- **The Metaphor for Death:** Jesus' own words.
  - John 11:11-14 - Jesus calls the death of Lazarus a "sleep." He had to
    explain it plainly to the disciples who were culturally conditioned to think
    otherwise.
  - This is the consistent biblical model: a state of unconscious rest.
  - [EB]: Daniel 12:2 ("many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
    awake...").
- **Who Has Immortality?**
  - 1 Timothy 6:15-16 - Describes God as the one "who only hath immortality."
  - If God _only_ has it, then by definition, we do not possess it inherently.
    It is a gift to be given.
  - [Aside]: We don't have "immortal souls"; we are candidates for immortality,
    a gift granted at the resurrection through Christ (1 Cor 15:51-54). This is
    the core of the Gospel promise.

### **Section 3: The Danger of the Lie & Last-Day Urgency (12 min)**

- **The Lie is Satan's Enchanted Ground:**
  - If the dead are not dead, who are people communicating with in seances,
    through mediums, or in supposed visitations?
  - 2 Corinthians 11:14 - "And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into
    an angel of light."
  - [RQ]: If Satan can appear as an angel of light, can his demons not appear as
    our departed loved ones? (Rev 16:14)
- **The Foundation of Spiritualism:**
  - The belief in an immortal soul opens the door to communication with "spirits
    of devils."
  - Revelation 16:13-14 - Unclean spirits like frogs, the "spirits of devils,
    working miracles," go forth to deceive the whole world before Armageddon.
  - [WB]: The Lie (Immortal Soul) -> Doorway to Spiritualism -> Final Deception
    (Rev 16:14).
  - [Aside]: This isn't just about Ouija boards. It's in movies, books, and even
    grief counseling that encourages "talking" to the deceased. It's a subtle
    unlearning of biblical truth and a learning of satanic principles.
- **A Biblical Warning:**
  - Isaiah 8:19-20 - "And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
    familiar spirits... should not a people seek unto their God? for the living
    to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to
    this word, it is because there is no light in them."
  - Our only safety is in God's Word. Any spiritual experience must be tested
    against Scripture.
- [EB]: 1 Samuel 28 (The "spirit" of Samuel appearing to Saul was a familiar
  spirit, a demonic impersonation, not the prophet himself).
- [EB]: Luke 16:19-31 (The parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus was a parable
  using common folklore to teach a lesson about earthly choices, not a literal
  description of the afterlife. Its point is in v. 31: "If they hear not Moses
  and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the
  dead.")

### **Conclusion & Appeal (8 min)**

- **Summary of Truth:**
  - The lie began in Eden: "Ye shall not surely die."
  - The Bible teaches death is an unconscious sleep. Man is mortal.
  - This lie is the foundation for Satan's final, powerful deceptions through
    spiritualism.
- **The True Christian Hope:**
  - Our hope is not in surviving death, but in being _rescued from_ death.
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17 - The dead in Christ do not go to heaven at death.
    They rest, awaiting the voice of the archangel and the trump of God.
  - The "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) is the Second Coming of Jesus, when the dead
    are resurrected and the living are changed, and we all receive the gift of
    immortality together.
- **The Appeal:**
  - Let us commit to being a people of the Book. Let us unlearn the fables of
    paganism and stand firmly on the "It is written."
  - This truth protects our minds, guards our faith, and keeps our hope fixed on
    the only one who can give life: Jesus Christ, the Resurrection and the Life
    (John 11:25).
  - Will you choose to believe God's Word over the first great lie?
