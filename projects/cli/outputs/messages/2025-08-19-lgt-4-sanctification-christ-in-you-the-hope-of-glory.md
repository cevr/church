### Introduction: Justification vs. Sanctification (5 min)

- Defining our terms: Justification and Sanctification.
  - Justification: Our legal standing. Declared righteous. A one-time event upon
    accepting Christ. (Rom 5:1)
  - Sanctification: Our actual condition. Made righteous. The work of a
    lifetime. (1 Thess 5:23)
  - [WB]: Two Columns: **Justification** (Legal, Declared Righteous, For Us) vs.
    **Sanctification** (Moral, Made Righteous, In Us)
- The central mystery revealed: Colossians 1:27.
  - The "mystery" isn't complicated; it's Christ _IN_ you. This is the engine of
    sanctification.
  - [RQ]: What does "hope of glory" mean? Is it just a future event, or does it
    have present reality according to this verse?
- [EB]: Genesis 1:26-27 (The "glory" is the restoration of the image of God in
  which we were created).

### Main Content 1: The Divine Method of Sanctification (12 min)

- **Christ's Parable of Connection: The Vine and the Branches.**
  - Read John 15:1-8.
  - Jesus is the source, we are the conduits. (John 15:1, 5)
  - The core command: "Abide in me." (John 15:4)
  - [WB]: Simple Diagram: **VINE (Jesus)** --> **BRANCH (Believer)** --> **FRUIT
    (Character/Holiness)**
  - [RQ]: What does it practically mean to "abide"? Is it a feeling or a
    conscious choice of dependence? (John 15:7, 10)
  - The result of abiding: Much fruit. (John 15:5) This is not self-effort.
  - The result of disconnection: "Ye can do nothing." (John 15:5b) Utter
    helplessness in sanctification without Christ.
- **The Process of Pruning.**
  - The Father's role as the "husbandman" or gardener. (John 15:1-2)
  - Pruning (trials, conviction of sin) is not punishment, but preparation for
    greater fruitfulness.
  - [Aside]: A skilled gardener cuts a vine back severely, not to harm it, but
    because they know its potential. The cuts look harsh, but they are essential
    for a healthy harvest. God's pruning in our lives serves the same loving,
    restorative purpose.
  - [EB]: Hebrews 12:11 (Chastening yields the peaceable fruit of
    righteousness).

### Main Content 2: God's Will and Our Transformation [*] (12 min)

- **The Express Will of God.**
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:3 - "For this is the will of God, even your
    sanctification..."
  - This is not a suggestion or a lofty ideal; it is the central purpose of
    God's plan for us after justification.
  - [RQ]: If this is God's will, why is the process often a struggle? (ref. Gal
    5:17 - flesh vs. Spirit).
  - [EGW]: "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day, but of a
    lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the result
    of constantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ." (AA 560.2)
- **The Educational Process of Transformation.**
  - 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with open face beholding... are changed
    into the same image..."
  - How does this change happen? By "beholding."
  - [WB]: Beholding Christ (in Word/Prayer) --> Changed into His Image
    (Character Restoration).
  - This is "True Education": unlearning the world's ways by focusing our minds
    on Christ's character and truth.
  - [RQ]: What are we "beholding" daily? Social media? The news? How does that
    shape our image vs. beholding Christ?
  - [EB]: Romans 12:2 (Be not conformed, but be ye transformed by the renewing
    of your mind).

### Main Content 3: The Urgent Necessity of Holiness (10 min)

- **A Non-Negotiable Requirement.**
  - Hebrews 12:14 - "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no
    man shall see the Lord."
  - This is not about earning salvation, but the necessary character fitness for
    heaven.
  - [RQ]: How does this verse square with salvation by grace alone? (ref. Eph
    2:8-10 - we are saved _unto_ good works).
  - [Aside]: An astronaut must train and wear a special suit to survive in
    space. It doesn't earn them the trip, but it's the necessary preparation to
    exist in that new environment. Holiness is the atmosphere of heaven.
- **The Final Generation Context.**
  - This call to holiness has special significance for those living in the time
    of the end.
  - The work of the Investigative Judgment in the heavenly sanctuary calls for a
    corresponding work of purification and character perfection in God's people
    on earth.
  - [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (The cleansing of the Sanctuary is linked to a people
    being cleansed and sealed).
  - [EB]: Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they
    that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." This describes
    the fruit of sanctification in the last generation.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap: The Source and Goal.**
  - The _method_ is not trying harder, but abiding deeper. (John 15:4)
  - The _power_ is not our own, but "Christ in you." (Col 1:27)
  - The _goal_ is the restoration of God's image in us, a character fit for
    eternity. (2 Cor 3:18)
  - The _urgency_ is that without this completed work, we cannot stand in His
    presence. (Heb 12:14)
- **The Educational Choice.**
  - Sanctification is a daily choice to submit to God's educational process.
  - It is a choice to disconnect from the world's influence and abide in Christ,
    the True Vine.
  - [WB]: Our Choice: **Abide & Bear Fruit** OR **Disconnect & Wither** (John
    15:5-6).
- **Appeal.**
  - [RQ]: Is your Christian life one of frustrating self-effort or restful
    abiding?
  - The invitation is to stop striving and start surrendering. To let the Vine
    do the work through the branch.
  - Let us pray for a deeper experience of "Christ in you," the only power that
    sanctifies, the only true "hope of glory."
