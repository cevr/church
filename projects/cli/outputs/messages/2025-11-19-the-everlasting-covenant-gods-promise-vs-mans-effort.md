### Introduction: Defining the Terms

- **Misconception:** Common belief that "Old Covenant" = Old Testament (Law/Doom) and "New Covenant" = New Testament (Grace/Freedom).
- **Thesis:** The New Covenant is God's everlasting plan of salvation by grace (God's promise). The "Old Covenant" is humanity's failed attempt to save themselves by works (Man's promise).
- **Jeremiah 31:31-33:** God promises a "new" covenant.
    - Note that the *content* (the Law) doesn't change; the *location* changes (tables of stone vs. fleshy tables of the heart).
    - [WB]: Draw two columns:
        1. OLD COVENANT: Based on "WE will do." (Failure)
        2. NEW COVENANT: Based on "I [God] will do." (Success)
- **Restoration Context:** Salvation is not just legal adjustment; it is the restoration of the image of God in the soul. The New Covenant is the only method that achieves this.
- [RQ]: If God is the same yesterday, today, and forever, why would He ever design a covenant based on works? Or was the Old Covenant actually a revealing of the people's heart? (Heb 13:8)

### Section 1: The Two Seeds - Eden to Abel

- **Genesis 3:15:** The very first Covenant promise immediately after the Fall.
    - "I will put enmity..."
    - It is *God's* action. He provides the Lamb (Jesus). He crushes the serpent. Adam and Eve do nothing but accept the covering (skins).
    - [EB]: Revelation 13:8 - The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. The "New Covenant" plan predates creation.
- **Genesis 4:3-5:** The Tale of Two Offerings.
    - **Cain (The Old Covenant Mindset):** Brought the fruit of the ground (his own hard work/tilling). A bloodless offering.
        - Represented salvation by works/character development without the Atonement.
    - **Abel (The New Covenant Mindset):** Brought the firstlings of the flock (blood).
        - Represented faith in God's provision. He relied on the Substitute.
    - [WB]: Visual: CAIN = "My Effort" (Rejected). ABEL = "God's Lamb" (Accepted).
    - [RQ]: Why was Cain wroth? Is it possible to be religious, hardworking, and worshiping, yet still be lost under the Old Covenant? (Gen 4:5-6)
- **Restoration through Education:** Cain refused to "unlearn" his self-reliance. Abel accepted the instruction of the sacrificial system (True Education) which pointed away from self to the Redeemer.
- [Aside]: Imagine trying to pay a massive debt with monopoly money you printed yourself. That is Cain's offering. Abel brought the Gold standard signed by the King.

### Section 2: The Two Mothers - Flesh vs. Promise

- **Galatians 4:22-26:** Paul explicitly uses Hagar and Sarah as an allegory for the two covenants.
- **The Story (Genesis 16 vs Genesis 21):**
    - **Hagar (Old Covenant):** Abraham and Sarah tried to fulfill God's promise *through their own strength/flesh* because God seemed too slow.
        - Result: Ishmael (Bondage, wildness, human effort).
    - **Sarah (New Covenant):** Abraham had to wait until his body was "as good as dead" (Rom 4:19).
        - Result: Isaac (Miracle, child of promise, impossible by human standards).
- [EGW]: "The covenant of grace was first made with man in Eden... This same covenant was renewed to Abraham... But if the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of redemption, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? ... The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts, and that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep God's law..." (PP 370.2 - 371.4)
- **The Principle:** The Old Covenant is *distrust* of God's power to perform His word, leading to human devising.
- [WB]: Diagram:
    - Hagar = Mount Sinai = Bondage = "I can help God out."
    - Sarah = Jerusalem Above = Free = "God must do the impossible in me."
- [EB]: Romans 4:20-22 - Abraham was strong in faith, giving glory to God. Faith is believing God will do what He promised.

### Section 3: The Two Responses - Sinai & Kingship [*]

- **Exodus 19:8:** "All that the LORD hath spoken we will do."
    - Often read as a pledge of loyalty, but contextually, it was a pledge of self-sufficiency. They didn't say "All that the Lord hath spoken, *may He help us* to do."
    - The "Old Covenant" was ratified on the promises of the *people*. The New Covenant is ratified on the promises of *God* (Heb 8:6 - "better promises").
- [RQ]: How quickly did they break their promise? (Exodus 32 - The Golden Calf). What does this teach us about the stability of a covenant based on human willpower?
- **The Request for a King (1 Samuel 8:5-7):**
    - Israel rejected God as King (New Covenant reliance) and wanted a king "like all the nations" (Old Covenant/Worldly system).
    - **Saul:** Tall, handsome, the people's choice. Represents the flesh/outward appearance.
    - **David:** The youngest, a shepherd, God's choice. Represents the Spirit/Inner heart.
- [Aside]: We often live "Saul" lives—trying to look the part of a good Christian externally—while God is waiting to give us a "David" experience—a heart fully surrendered and empowered by His Spirit.
- **The Unlearning Process:** Israel had to learn through centuries of failure that their promises were ropes of sand. True Education involves realizing our helplessness so we can finally accept God's power.
- [EB]: Deuteronomy 5:28-29 - God wishes they had a heart to fear Him. He knew their "we will do it" promise was empty, but He had to let them try and fail to teach them.

### Conclusion: The Final Generation & The Heart

- **Hebrews 8:10 & Ezekiel 36:26:** The New Covenant is God writing His Law on the heart.
    - It is not the abolition of the Law, but the *internalization* of it.
    - This is the restoration of the Image of God.
- [WB]: The Sanctuary:
    - Outer Court: Sacrifice (Justification).
    - Holy Place: Sanctification (Bread/Light/Prayer).
    - Most Holy: The Ark (The Law covered by Mercy).
    - *The Goal:* To make the human mind a Most Holy Place where the Law is written by the Spirit.
- **Urgency & Application:**
    - We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement. We cannot survive the Final Crisis with an "Old Covenant" experience (trying hard to be good).
    - We need the "New Covenant" experience (Christ living out His life in us).
- **Action Steps for Restoration:**
    1. **Stop** promising God "I will do better next time" (Old Covenant).
    2. **Start** claiming His promise: "Lord, You promised to circumcise my heart. Do it now." (Deut 30:6).
    3. **Daily Education:** Read the Bible not as a rulebook to master, but as a revelation of the God who masters sin.
- [RQ]: As we look to the closing scenes of earth's history, is your confidence in your grip on God (Old Covenant), or His grip on you (New Covenant)? (Phil 1:6)
