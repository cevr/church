### Introduction (5 min)

- Opening Thought: The church is not a club for the saved, but a rescue station
  for the lost. Its very existence is for mission.
- The "lifeblood" of the church is its outward-focused work. When it ceases, the
  church begins to die.
- [RQ]: If evangelism is the lifeblood, what happens when we personally stop
  participating? What does that say about our own spiritual circulation?
- Introduce the focus: Not just evangelism in general, but our specific,
  God-given, end-time assignment—the Three Angels' Messages.
- Present Central Verse: Revelation 14:12. This is not just _what_ we preach,
  but _who we must become_ to preach it effectively. The message and the
  messenger are inseparable.

### Main Content 1: The Unchanging Commission & The Final Warning (10 min)

- **The Foundational Command:** Matthew 28:19-20.
  - This command was given to every believer, in every age. It did not expire
    with the apostles.
  - [WB]: GO — TEACH — BAPTIZE (The active verbs of the commission) (Matt 28:19)
  - This is the educational framework for making disciples.
- **The Final Application:** Revelation 14:6-11.
  - The Great Commission finds its most urgent and specific fulfillment in the
    Three Angels' Messages for the last days.
  - **1st Angel (v. 6-7):** The everlasting gospel PLUS the context of the "hour
    of His judgment"—a direct reference to the pre-advent Investigative Judgment
    that began in 1844. (Dan 8:14)
  - [EB]: Daniel 7:9-10 (The judgment scene is set in heaven before the Second
    Coming).
  - **2nd Angel (v. 8):** "Babylon is fallen"—a call out of religious confusion
    and systems that have rejected God's truths.
  - **3rd Angel (v. 9-11):** The clearest, most solemn warning in all of
    Scripture against false worship (the beast and his image) and receiving the
    mark.
  - [RQ]: Why does God combine the sweet "everlasting gospel" with such a severe
    warning in His final message? (Rev 14:6, 9)

### Main Content 2: The Watchman's Solemn Duty (12 min) [*]

- **The Personal Mandate:** Ezekiel 33:7-9.
  - God appoints us as spiritual watchmen on the walls of Zion.
  - [Aside]: A watchman who sleeps at his post is a traitor. He is responsible
    for the lives lost because he failed to sound the alarm. This illustrates
    the gravity of our personal responsibility.
  - Our silence has eternal consequences, not just for others, but for us ("his
    blood will I require at thine hand").
  - [WB]: Draw a simple flow chart:
    - GOD'S WORD -> WATCHMAN -> WARNING -> Wicked Turns (Saved) / Wicked Rejects
      (Lost, Watchman Innocent)
    - GOD'S WORD -> WATCHMAN (SILENT) -> Wicked Dies (Lost, Watchman Guilty)
      (Eze 33:8)
- **The Necessity of Personal Effort:**
  - [EGW]: "The work of God in this earth can never be finished until the men
    and women comprising our church membership rally to the work, and unite
    their efforts with those of ministers and church officers." (Gospel Workers,
    352.1)
  - [RQ]: Are we waiting for the pastor, the evangelist, or the conference to do
    the work God has assigned personally to us? (Eze 33:7)
  - [EB]: Genesis 4:9 ("Am I my brother's keeper?") - Cain's question is the
    anthem of a selfish heart, the very opposite of the watchman's spirit.
  - This work is part of our own restoration—unlearning selfishness and learning
    God's selfless love for the lost.

### Main Content 3: The Messenger is the Message (12 min)

- **The Divine Power:** Acts 1:8.
  - We are not called to work in our own strength. The command is followed by
    the promise of power.
  - [WB]: Jerusalem (Family/Church) -> Judea (Community) -> Samaria (Neighbors)
    -> Uttermost Part (World) (Acts 1:8)
  - [RQ]: What is your personal "Jerusalem" where your witness must begin?
- **The Credibility of the Witness:** Revelation 14:12.
  - The effectiveness of the warning message depends on the character of the
    messenger.
  - This is where True Education culminates: God restores His own character in
    His people so they can represent Him accurately.
  - Let's break down the character traits:
    1.  **"Patience of the saints":** Enduring perseverance through trial
        without compromise. Not passive waiting, but active faithfulness under
        pressure.
    2.  **"Keep the commandments of God":** A loving obedience that upholds
        God's entire law, including the Sabbath, as the standard of
        righteousness. This is the great test in the final conflict.
    3.  **"The faith of Jesus":** Not just faith _in_ Jesus, but the very faith
        _of_ Jesus—a complete, trusting reliance on the Father that produces
        perfect obedience.
  - [EB]: Colossians 4:5-6 (Walk in wisdom toward them that are without... let
    your speech be alway with grace).
- **Finding Our Opportunities (Practical Application):**
  - The Holy Spirit has already prepared hearts around us. We must have eyes to
    see.
  - Examine your spheres of influence:
    - **Workplace:** Integrity, diligence, kindness.
    - **Neighborhood:** Being a good neighbor, acts of service.
    - **Family:** Patience, unconditional love.
    - **Health Message:** Sharing principles of health can be the "entering
      wedge" for the full gospel message.
  - [EB]: 1 Peter 3:15 (Be ready always to give an answer... with meekness and
    fear).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Summary: The command is universal (Matt 28), the final message is specific
  (Rev 14), our duty is personal (Ezek 33), and the power is divine (Acts 1:8).
- [EGW]: "On every hand, doors are open for the proclamation of the truth. We
  should be seeking to push the work forward. As a people, we shall be judged by
  the light that has been given us." (Adapted from 8T 25.1)
- The greatest argument for the truth is a transformed life. The Third Angel's
  Message is not just a doctrine to be preached, but a life to be lived.
- **Appeal:**
  - A call to self-examination. Not in guilt, but in sober reflection.
  - [RQ]: Lord, where have I been a silent watchman? Where are the opportunities
    you have placed in my path that I have overlooked?
  - An invitation to pray a simple prayer: "Lord, make me a laborer. Show me my
    corner of the vineyard. Fill me with Your Spirit and a love for the lost,
    and I will go."
  - The work must be finished. Christ is waiting for a people who fully reflect
    His character to finish it. Let us be that people.
