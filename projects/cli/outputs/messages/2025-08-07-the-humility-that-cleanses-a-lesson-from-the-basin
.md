### **Introduction (3 min)**

- Setting the Scene: The Upper Room, Passover, hours before the cross (Luke
  22:14-15).
- A moment of tension: Disciples arguing over who is greatest (Luke 22:24).
- Christ's unexpected action: He takes a towel and a basin (John 13:4-5).
- [RQ]: Why would Jesus, on the most solemn night of His life, perform the task
  of the lowest servant? What was He trying to teach them—and us?

### **Section 1: The Symbols of Our Walk (6 min)**

- **What do the feet represent? Our Daily Walk.**
  - Our journey through a sinful world soils us.
  - Psalm 119:105 - "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet..." Our walk is guided by
    the Word.
  - Ephesians 5:2 - "And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us..."
  - [Aside]: Like walking on a dusty road, even with the best intentions, we
    pick up the grime of daily temptations, misunderstandings, and selfish
    thoughts.

- **What does the washing represent? Two-Fold Cleansing.**
  - Peter's objection reveals a profound truth (John 13:8).
  - **The Bath:** "He that is washed..." (John 13:10a).
    - This is the initial, all-encompassing cleansing. Justification. Baptism.
    - Titus 3:5 - "the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost."
    - [EB]: Ephesians 5:26 (Christ cleanses the church "with the washing of
      water by the word.")
  - **The Feet:** "...needeth not save to wash his feet..." (John 13:10b).
    - This is the daily cleansing from sins that "so easily beset us."
      Sanctification.
    - 1 John 1:9 - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
      us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
    - [WB]: Draw a line. Above: BATH = Justification (Titus 3:5). Below:
      FOOT-WASHING = Daily Sanctification (1 John 1:9).

### **Section 2: The Education in Humility [*] (6 min)**

- **The Attitude: Unlearning Pride.**
  - Christ's example is the curriculum (John 13:14-15).
  - The ultimate lesson in humility: The Creator kneels before the creature.
  - Philippians 2:3-5 - "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ
    Jesus."
  - [RQ]: How does the physical act of kneeling before a brother or sister
    prepare the heart for genuine reconciliation? (Phil 2:3)

- **The Action: Confessing Faults.**
  - James 5:16 - "Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
    that ye may be healed."
  - This is not a sacrament, but a relational act of healing. It's about
    removing barriers between brethren.
  - [EGW]: "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for the sacramental
    service. While pride, variance, and strife for supremacy are cherished, the
    heart cannot enter into fellowship with Christ. We are not prepared to
    receive the communion of His body and His blood. It is for this reason that
    the Lord appointed the ordinance of foot-washing." (DA 650.3)
  - [EB]: Galatians 6:1-2 (If a man be overtaken in a fault, restore him in the
    spirit of meekness, considering thyself.)

- **The Spirit: Forgiveness and Restoration.**
  - The goal is not just to admit wrong, but to restore fellowship.
  - [WB]: Write: Humility -> Confession -> Forgiveness -> Unity.
  - [EB]: Psalm 51:2, 7 (David's plea: "Wash me throughly from mine iniquity...
    purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean.")

### **Conclusion: The Goal of Unity and Readiness (5 min)**

- **The Immediate Goal: Unity.**
  - The ordinance breaks down walls of pride, jealousy, and misunderstanding.
  - It prepares a unified body to meet with their Head, Jesus Christ.
  - Hebrews 12:14-15 - Follow peace with all men... lest any "root of
    bitterness" spring up.

- **The Ultimate Goal: Readiness.**
  - This service is a preparation to receive the emblems of Christ's sacrifice.
  - 1 Corinthians 11:28 - "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of
    that bread, and drink of that cup."
  - [RQ]: How does this ordinance of cleansing and humility connect to our
    preparation for Christ's soon return?
  - This is a miniature of the Investigative Judgment—a time of heart-searching,
    repentance, and cleansing by the blood of the Lamb.
  - [EB]: Malachi 3:2-3 (He is like a refiner's fire... and he shall purify the
    sons of Levi... that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in
    righteousness.)

- **Appeal:**
  - Tonight, this is more than a ritual. It is an education in humility.
  - It is an opportunity to be cleansed from the dust of the journey.
  - It is a divine appointment to reconcile with God and with one another.
  - Let us enter into it with the mind of Christ, ready to wash and be washed,
    so we may be truly one with Him and with each other.
