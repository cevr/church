### I. Introduction (6 min)

- [RQ]: What must fundamentally change when a Holy God purposes to dwell among a
  sinful people? (Ex 25:8)
- Exodus 25:8 — God's desire: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell
  among them."
- [WB]: Central Question: How does GOD make dwelling possible? (Ex 25:8)
- The sanctuary reveals God's comprehensive plan: education, cleansing,
  restoration to His image—all enabling divine indwelling.
- [WB]: Draw: GOD'S PRESENCE ←(Barrier: SIN)→ PEOPLE | Solution: SANCTUARY (Ex
  25:8)
- [EB]: Hebrews 8:1-2, 5 (Heavenly Sanctuary—the true tabernacle; earthly is
  copy and shadow)
- Today's focus: The process God ordained—from willing heart through
  Spirit-empowerment and pattern-obedience to indwelling glory.

### II. The Divine Call and Human Response: Counting the Cost with a Willing Heart (10 min)

**A. God's Invitation to Co-Labor**

- Exodus 25:8 — "Let _them_ make me a sanctuary."
- [RQ]: Why does God invite human participation in His dwelling project? (Ex
  25:8)
- God could build it Himself, but He calls us into the work—a partnership that
  transforms the builders.
- [WB]: GOD CALLS → HUMAN RESPONDS (Ex 25:8)

**B. The Prerequisites: Willingness and Sacrifice**

- Exodus 35:5, 21 — "Whosoever is of a willing heart... every one whose heart
  stirred him up."
- Luke 14:28-30 — "Which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
  first, and counteth the cost?"
- [RQ]: Before offering our hands, what must we first count and surrender? (Luke
  14:28; Ex 35:5)
- [WB]: Key Concept: COUNT THE COST (Luke 14:28) → WILLING HEART (Ex 35:21)
- [EGW]: "Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in
  preparing a dwelling place for the Most High." (PP 343.3)
- God asks us to inventory what He requires: time, treasure, talent, comfort,
  will itself.
- [Aside]: Like clearing ground for a foundation—we must first remove what
  occupies the space God wants to fill. Counting the cost means identifying what
  must go before we can build.
- Exodus 35:21 — The people's response: hearts stirred, spirits willing,
  offerings brought.
- [EB]: Ezekiel 36:26-27 (God promises: new heart, new spirit within—He enables
  the willingness itself)

**C. Bridging to Practice: The Educational Foundation**

- The willing heart is the first lesson in True Education—unlearning
  self-ownership, learning surrender.
- [WB]: Education Step 1: SURRENDER WILL → OFFER MEANS (Ex 35:21; Rom 12:1)
- Actionable Steps:
  1. Unlearn: Reluctance, withholding, conditional obedience.
  2. Learn/Apply: This week, identify one specific "cost" God is asking (time in
     Word, financial sacrifice, habit change) and offer it willingly. (2 Cor
     9:7)

### III. The Pattern Revealed and Spirit-Empowered Understanding (12 min)

**A. God Shows the Pattern**

- Exodus 25:9 — "According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
  tabernacle... so shall ye make it."
- Exodus 25:40 — "Look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed
  thee in the mount."
- [RQ]: Why is Moses taken up to see the pattern before any construction begins?
  (Ex 25:9, 40)
- The pattern originates in heaven—God's design, not human innovation.
- [WB]: Step 1: GOD REVEALS PATTERN (Ex 25:9, 40) — (Heavenly Original)
- The Pattern Today:
  - Hebrews 8:5 confirms earthly sanctuary made "after the pattern shewed to
    thee in the mount."
  - [WB]: Our Pattern: THE WORD (Ps 119:105) + CHRIST HIMSELF (John 1:14; Heb
    1:3)
  - [EB]: John 1:1, 14 (Christ is the Word made flesh—the living Pattern of
    God's character)
  - Jesus declared, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." (John 14:9)
- [RQ]: How can sinful humans comprehend, let alone execute, a heavenly pattern?
  (Ex 25:40; 1 Cor 2:14)

**B. The Spirit Imparts Wisdom, Understanding, Knowledge, and Skill**

- Exodus 31:1-6 — God calls Bezalel and Aholiab by name.
- Exodus 31:3 — "And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
  understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship."
- [WB]: Step 2: SPIRIT FILLS → Wisdom / Understanding / Knowledge / Skill (Ex
  31:3)
- [RQ]: What is the difference between _knowing about_ the pattern and having
  _Spirit-given understanding_ to apply it? (Ex 31:3; 1 Cor 2:12-14)
- Wisdom: Ability to see the whole purpose—_why_ God's design matters.
- Understanding: Grasping the principles—_how_ each element functions.
- Knowledge: Specific truth and instruction—_what_ God has revealed.
- Skill (Workmanship): Spirit-empowered ability to execute with
  precision—_doing_ according to pattern.
- [WB]: Diagram: PATTERN (Ex 25:40) → SPIRIT (Ex 31:3) → SKILL → OBEDIENCE (Ex
  39:42-43)
- [Aside]: Consider a master architect handing you a blueprint for a complex
  structure. The blueprint alone isn't enough—you need his mind, his insight
  into _why_ each measurement matters, and his empowerment to execute it
  correctly. The Spirit does this for God's pattern.
- [EGW]: "God Himself gave to Moses the plan of that structure... Every
  specification in regard to its construction was given by divine wisdom." (PP
  343.1)

**C. Bridging to Practice: Receiving Spirit-Empowered Understanding**

- This is True Education: God reveals the pattern (His Word, His Son), then
  imparts the capacity to understand and apply it through His Spirit.
- [WB]: Education Step 2: BEHOLD PATTERN (Word/Christ) → RECEIVE SPIRIT'S WISDOM
  (John 16:13)
- Actionable Steps:
  1. Unlearn: Relying on human wisdom, self-interpretation, selective reading of
     Scripture.
  2. Learn/Apply: Daily prayer: "Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
     things out of thy law." (Ps 119:18) Ask the Spirit for understanding before
     study.
- [EB]: James 1:5 (If any lack wisdom, let him ask of God who gives liberally)

### IV. The Sanctifying Sign: Evidence of God's Indwelling [*] (8 min)

**A. The Sabbath Follows the Spirit's Impartation**

- Exodus 31:3-6 — Spirit given for the work.
- Exodus 31:13 — Immediately after, God declares: "Verily my sabbaths ye shall
  keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye
  may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you."
- [RQ]: Why does God place the Sabbath command directly after empowering the
  builders with His Spirit? (Ex 31:3, 13)
- [WB]: Sequence: SPIRIT FILLS (v.3) → SABBATH SIGN (v.13) — What's the
  connection?

**B. The Sabbath as Sign of Sanctification**

- Exodus 31:13 — "That ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you."
- The Sabbath is not merely a day off—it's a weekly proclamation: _God_ is the
  one doing the sanctifying work.
- [WB]: SABBATH = SIGN: "I the LORD sanctify you" (Ex 31:13)
- [EGW]: "To those who keep holy the Sabbath day it is the sign of
  sanctification... oneness with Him in character... And the Sabbath is the sign
  of obedience." (6T 350.2)
- We rest from our works as God rested from His—acknowledging He is the Creator
  and Re-Creator.
- The Spirit within enables the obedience; the Sabbath-keeping testifies that
  the Spirit is present.

**C. Obedience as Proof of Indwelling**

- [RQ]: How does Sabbath-keeping become evidence that God dwells within us? (Ex
  31:13; John 14:23)
- Obedience is not the _cause_ of His dwelling—it's the _proof_ that He is
  already there, working.
- [WB]: Equation: SPIRIT WITHIN → OBEDIENCE FLOWS → SABBATH SIGN (Ex 31:13; Ezek
  36:27)
- Ezekiel 36:27 — "And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
  my statutes."
- When God's Spirit fills, obedience becomes natural fruit, not forced
  compliance.
- The Sabbath declares: "This is not my power; the LORD sanctifies."
- [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (Cleansing of heavenly sanctuary—calls for practical
  holiness, Sabbath faithfulness in last days)

**D. Bridging to Practice**

- [Aside]: Imagine a sealed letter bearing a king's signet ring. The seal proves
  authenticity and authority. The Sabbath is God's seal on His people—proof that
  His authority (Spirit) is within, sanctifying.
- Actionable Steps:
  1. Unlearn: Treating Sabbath as legalistic duty or cultural tradition.
  2. Learn/Apply: This Sabbath, consciously rest _in His sanctifying work_, not
     your effort. Reflect on one area where His Spirit is transforming you. (Isa
     58:13-14)

### V. The Glory Fills the Obedient Dwelling (6 min)

**A. The Completion According to Pattern**

- Exodus 39:42-43 — "According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
  children of Israel made all the work. And Moses did look upon all the work,
  and, behold, they had done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done
  it: and Moses blessed them."
- [WB]: Refrain: "AS THE LORD COMMANDED" (Ex 39:42-43)
- [RQ]: Why the repeated emphasis on doing _exactly_ as commanded? (Ex 39:42-43;
  cf. Ex 25:40)
- Pattern-faithful obedience matters—it's alignment with heavenly reality, not
  legalism.
- [EB]: Leviticus 16 (Day of Atonement—precise order of confession, cleansing,
  afflicting soul)

**B. The Indwelling Glory**

- Exodus 40:34-35 — "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
  glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into
  the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
  of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
- [RQ]: When does the glory fill—before, during, or after the faithful
  completion? (Ex 40:34-35)
- [WB]: Timeline: OBEDIENCE COMPLETED (Ex 39:42-43) → GLORY FILLS (Ex 40:34-35)
- God fills what He designs, when obedience prepares the dwelling.
- The glory was so overwhelming Moses couldn't enter—God's presence tangible,
  transformative.

**C. Christ, the True Tabernacle**

- John 1:14 — "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt [*tabernacled*] among us,
  (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,)
  full of grace and truth."
- [WB]: Pattern Fulfilled: CHRIST TABERNACLED AMONG US (John 1:14) — Glory
  Revealed
- Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment—God dwelling in human flesh, character
  perfectly reflecting the Father.
- [EB]: 2 Corinthians 3:18 (Beholding His glory, we are changed—image restored
  progressively)

**D. The Final Reality**

- Revelation 21:3 — "And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
  tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them."
- [WB]: Final Goal: GOD DWELLS WITH US FOREVER (Rev 21:3)
- The sanctuary process culminates: God's eternal presence with a restored,
  obedient people.

**E. Bridging to Practice**

- Actionable Steps:
  1. Unlearn: Self-display, living for human applause. (Matt 6:1-4)
  2. Learn/Apply: Behold Christ daily in Scripture; practice one hidden act of
     service this week so only His character is seen. (Phil 2:5)
