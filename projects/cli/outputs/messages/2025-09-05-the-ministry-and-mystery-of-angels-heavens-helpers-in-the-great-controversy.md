Introduction – The Unseen Conflict (6 min)

- Revelation 12:7-9 — Great Controversy sets the stage (two legions active on
  earth)
- Hebrews 1:14 — Purpose: minister to heirs of salvation
- [RQ]: If angels are “sent forth,” what does that imply about God’s nearness
  and our daily education in salvation? (Heb 1:14)

  - Psalm 103:20 — “Excel in strength… do His commandments”

    1:14)
  - [RQ]: How does their created nature guard us from worshiping them? (Col
    1:16)
- Angels and Creation/Elements

    encampment? (Ps 34:7, 9-14)
  - [WB]: List: Fear of the LORD = Depart from evil, Do good, Seek peace (Ps
    34:13-14)
  - [Aside]: Think of angels as Heaven’s EMTs—dispatched to scenes of obedience,
    prayer, and faith; they arrive fastest where God’s call is heeded.

Section 2 (12 min) [*] - Two Legions and Their Influence: Who Stays With Us?

- Two Armies in Scripture
  - Revelation 12:9 (Fallen angels); Revelation 5:11 (Holy hosts, innumerable)

    - [EGW]: “All the hosts of Satan cannot force the weakest soul to sin.” (DA
      490.1)

    - Acts 12:5-11 — United prayer; angel delivers Peter

Section 3 (11 min) [*] - Discernment and Practice: Cooperating with Heaven

- Testing the Spirits
  - Isaiah 8:20; 1 John 4:1 — Word-centered testing; not every supernatural is
    divine
  - 1 Corinthians 10:20; Deuteronomy 32:17 — Pagan “gods” = demons
  - Revelation 16:14 — Spirits of devils working miracles (end-time)
  - [RQ]: What simple test exposes a counterfeit “angel of light”? (Isa 8:20)
  - [EB]: Revelation 14:6-12 (Three Angels’ Messages: God’s end-time instruction
    through angel symbolism; truth vs. deception)
- True Education with Angels as God’s Helpers (Character Restoration)
  - Romans 12:2; Ephesians 4:22-24 — Unlearn/learn; mind renewal invites holy
    companionship
  - Colossians 3:16; Philippians 4:8 — Word-filled, thought-disciplined life =
    safe channel
  - [EGW]: “True education means more than the pursual of a certain course of
    study... It has to do with the whole being, and with the whole period of
    existence possible to man.” (Ed 13.1)
  - [WB]: Draw: Old Man (Eph 4:22) -> Beholding Word (Col 3:16) -> New Man (Eph
    4:24) — Angels aid the process (Heb 1:14)
  - [Aside]: Firewalls protect systems by rules; godly habits (Word, prayer,
    obedience) form spiritual firewalls that block intrusions and keep Heaven’s
    connection stable.
- Action Steps (Education for Restoration)
  - Based on James 4:7-8; Psalm 34:13-14; Philippians 4:8:
    1. Unlearn: Compromise with known sin; unfiltered media/occult curiosity;
       anger-pride pathways. (Eph 4:27; Ps 34:13)
    2. Learn/Apply: Daily surrender and Scripture response to temptation (Matt
       4:10), praise and gratitude routine (Ps 22:3), thought curation (Phil
       4:8), intercessory prayer (Acts 12:5).
    - [WB]: Action Board: Submit • Resist • Replace • Praise • Pray (Jas 4:7-8;
      Phil 4:8)
  - Promise of Protection
    - Psalm 91:11-12 — Commissioned protection within God’s ways
    - [RQ]: What choices place us “in His ways,” where angels are commissioned?
      (Ps 91:9-11)

Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Summary:
  - Angels are created, mighty, and sent to aid our salvation (Heb 1:14; Ps
    103:20).
  - Two legions labor: holy angels strengthen truth; evil angels push deception
    (Rev 12:9; Eph 6:12; 2 Cor 11:14).
  - Conditions matter: obedience, prayer, praise, and the Word strengthen
    Heaven’s encampment (Ps 34:7; Jas 4:7; Ps 22:3).
  - In the judgment-hour, angels witness and assist Heaven’s restoring work (Dan
    7:10; Zech 3:1-5).
- Invitation:
  - [RQ]: Will you align your daily habits with Heaven’s helpers and reject
    every doorway that gives place to the enemy? (Eph 4:27; Jas 4:7)
  - Response: Choose a specific “unlearn” and “learn” step this week to
    cooperate with Heaven’s education for character restoration.
- Encouragement:
  - [EGW]: “All the hosts of Satan cannot force the weakest soul to sin.” (DA
    490.1)
  - Assurance: “The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him,
    and delivereth them.” (Ps 34:7)
