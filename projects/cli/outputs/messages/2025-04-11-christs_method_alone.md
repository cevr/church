- Section 2: Winning Confidence & Ministering [*] (12 min)
- Section 3: Bidding Them Follow (12 min)
- Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

### Introduction (5 min)

- The Challenge: Reaching a skeptical, hurting world.
- The Divine Pattern: God's unchanging method for connection.
- Introduce Central Verse: Matthew 9:35-36 - Christ's comprehensive ministry
  driven by compassion.
- Outline the Four Steps (from Ministry of Healing, p. 143): Mingled, Showed
  Sympathy (Won Confidence), Ministered to Needs, Bade Follow.
- [WB]: Write the Four Steps: 1. Mingle 2. Sympathize/Confidence 3. Minister 4.
  Bid Follow (Matt 9:35-36)
- [RQ]: Why are all these steps necessary? Can we skip any? (Matt 9:36)

### Section 1: Mingling & Compassion (10 min)

- **Foundation: Moved with Compassion (Matt 9:36)**
  - Not pity from a distance, but deep empathy.
  - Seeing people as God sees them: harassed, helpless, needing a Shepherd.
  - [RQ]: How does genuine compassion change _how_ we approach people? (Matt
    9:36)
- **Step 1: He Mingled (Associated Freely)**
  - Breaking Social & Religious Barriers: Mark 2:15-17
    - Eating with publicans and sinners – intentional association.
    - Challenging exclusivity; demonstrating God's inclusive love.
    - [WB]: Diagram: Circle 'Us' vs. Circle 'Them' with Christ bridging the gap
      (Mark 2:16-17)
  - Going Where People Are: Luke 19:5 (Zacchaeus)
    - Jesus initiated the contact, sought him out.
    - Entered his home, his world.
  - [Aside]: Think about our own social circles. Are we intentionally 'mingling'
    with those outside our usual church or family groups, as Christ did?
  - [EB]: Isaiah 42:3 (A bruised reed shall he not break... He shall bring forth
    judgment unto truth - Gentle approach)

### Section 2: Winning Confidence & Ministering [*] (12 min)

- **Step 2: Showed Sympathy / Won Confidence**
  - Beyond Mingling: Building Trust.
  - Example: Woman at the Well (John 4:7-10)
    - Initiated conversation respectfully, crossed cultural divides.
    - Listened, showed genuine interest in her life.
    - Met her where she was, addressing her felt needs first (thirst).
    - [RQ]: How did Jesus' approach in John 4 break down barriers and build
      trust almost immediately? (John 4:9-10)
  - [EGW]: 'Christ's method alone will give true success in reaching the people.
    The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His
    sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then
    He bade them, ‘Follow Me.’' (Ministry of Healing, 143.3)
- **Step 3: Ministered to Their Needs**
  - Holistic Care: Physical, Mental, Spiritual (Matt 9:35; Acts 10:38)
    - Healing sickness, casting out demons, feeding hungry.
    - Addressing the _whole_ person – part of the **restoration** process.
    - [WB]: Needs Met -> Heart Opened (Acts 10:38)
  - Practical Service as Education: Demonstrating God's Kingdom.
    - Meeting needs wasn't the end goal, but the _means_ to reveal God's
      character and truth.
    - This is 'True Education' in action – showing, not just telling.
  - Example: Zacchaeus' Response (Luke 19:8-9)
    - Christ's acceptance (ministry to his need for belonging) led to repentance
      and **restoration**.
    - Salvation came to his house _through_ this interaction.
  - [EB]: James 1:27 (Pure religion involves visiting the fatherless/widows -
    practical ministry)
  - [EB]: Matthew 25:35-40 (Ministry to the 'least of these' is ministry to
    Christ)

### Section 3: Bidding Them Follow (12 min)

- **Step 4: Then He Bade Them, 'Follow Me'**
  - The Invitation Follows Relationship: Matthew 4:19
    - The call comes _after_ mingling, sympathy, and ministry.
    - Not a demand, but an invitation based on demonstrated love and
      trustworthiness.
  - What Does 'Follow Me' Mean?
    - More than agreement; implies discipleship, learning, transformation.
    - A call to **unlearn** worldly ways and **learn** His ways (Matt 11:29).
    - A call to **character development** – becoming like Him (1 John 2:6).
    - [WB]: Follow Me = Learn My Ways -> Become Like Me (Character Restoration)
  - The Goal: Restoration and Eternal Life
    - Following leads to the **restoration** of God's image (2 Cor 3:18).
    - Preparation for His Kingdom and readiness for His soon return.
    - [RQ]: How does understanding the previous steps change the weight and
      meaning of the call to 'Follow Me'? (Matt 4:19)
  - [Aside]: Building a bridge (mingling, sympathy, ministry) is essential
    before inviting someone to cross over (follow Christ). Trying to force the
    crossing without the bridge often fails.
  - [EB]: Acts 2:42-47 (Early church followed this pattern: fellowship, meeting
    needs, growth)
  - [EB]: Isaiah 58:6-8 (True fasting linked to practical service and
    restoration)

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

  reach hearts for His kingdom before it's too late.
