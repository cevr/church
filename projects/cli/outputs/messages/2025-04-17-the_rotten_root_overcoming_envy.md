### Main Content Section 1: The Origin - Where It All Began (10 min)

- The First Envy: Lucifer's Fall
  - Isaiah 14:12-14 - Lucifer's ambition fueled by envy of Christ's position.
    - [WB]: Lucifer's "I Wills" (Isa 14:13-14) vs. God's Will.
    - [RQ]: What was Lucifer envying in Christ? (Position, authority, worship?)
  - [EGW]: 'Lucifer was envious and jealous of Jesus Christ. Yet when all the
    angels bowed to Jesus to acknowledge His supremacy and high authority and
    rightful rule, Lucifer bowed with them; but his heart was filled with envy
    and hatred.' (SR 14.2)
  - Connection to Great Controversy: Envy was the seed.
    - [Aside]: Imagine the perfect harmony of heaven shattered by this one root
      feeling. It shows the power of even a single cherished sin.
  - [EB]: Ezekiel 28:12-17 (Parallel passage on Lucifer's beauty, wisdom, and
    fall due to pride/corruption).
- Envy's Spread: From Heaven to Earth
  - Genesis 3 - Serpent (Lucifer) tempted Eve, playing on discontent/desire for
    forbidden status ('be as gods').
  - Genesis 4:3-8 - Cain's envy of Abel's acceptance leads to murder.
    - [RQ]: How did God warn Cain about the sin crouching at his door (Gen 4:7)?
      How does this relate to envy?
    - [EB]: 1 John 3:12 (Explicitly links Cain's murder to his evil works and
      Abel's righteousness - envy implied).

### Main Content Section 2: The Fruit - Confusion and Corruption [*] (12 min)

- Envy Breeds Disorder and Evil:
  - James 3:14-16 - "But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts,
    glory not, and lie not against the truth. This wisdom descendeth not from
    above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish. For where envying and strife is,
    there is confusion and every evil work."
    - [WB]: James 3:16 - Envy -> Strife -> Confusion -> Every Evil Work.
    - [RQ]: What kind of 'confusion' and 'evil work' have you seen stem from
      envy in families, workplaces, or even churches?
- Envy as a Work of the Flesh:
  - Galatians 5:19-21 - Envy listed among works preventing inheritance of God's
    kingdom.
  - Galatians 5:26 - "Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one
    another, envying one another."
    - Contrast with Fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22-23) - Love, joy, peace are
      impossible alongside envy.
    - [WB]: Chart: Works of Flesh (Envy) vs. Fruit of Spirit (Love, Peace, Joy).
- Envy's Internal Destruction:
  - Revisit Proverbs 14:30 - "Rottenness of the bones."
    - Internal decay, affects physical and spiritual health.
    - [Aside]: Like an acid, envy corrodes the container (our heart) that holds
      it, destroying peace and happiness long before it harms the object of
      envy.
  - Job 5:2 - "For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
    one."
  - [EB]: Proverbs 27:4 ("Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is
    able to stand before envy?") - Highlights its insidious power.

### Main Content Section 3: God's View & The Cure - Restoration Through Christ (12 min)

- God Hates Envy:
  - It denies His goodness and sovereignty.
  - It fueled the rejection and crucifixion of Christ (Matthew 27:18 - Pilate
    knew).
  - [RQ]: Why is envy so offensive to a God of love and justice?
  - [EB]: Mark 7:21-23 (Jesus lists envy among the evils that defile a person
    from within).
- The Need for Restoration & Education:
  - Envy is part of the 'old man' that must be put off (Eph 4:22).
  - Requires unlearning selfishness, learning contentment and love.
  - [WB]: Unlearn: Envy/Coveting (Old Man) -> Learn: Contentment/Love (New Man -
    Eph 4:24).
- The Divine Antidote - Love & Humility:
  - 1 Corinthians 13:4 - "Charity [Love] suffereth long, and is kind; charity
    envieth not..."
    - True, Christ-like love rejoices in others' blessings.
  - Philippians 2:3-5 - "Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in
    lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. Look not
    every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let
    this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus..."
    - [RQ]: How does cultivating the mind of Christ (humility, focus on others)
      directly counteract the root of envy?
    - This is the core of True Education - replacing self-centeredness with
      Christ-centeredness.
  - [EGW]: 'The soul that is yielded to Christ cannot be tormented with envy...
    True sanctification means perfect love, perfect obedience, perfect
    conformity to the will of God.' (Adapted from SL 91.2, AA 564.2 - concept
    focus)
- Practical Steps in the Educational Journey:
  - 1.  Recognize & Confess: Acknowledge envy when it arises (1 John 1:9).
  - 2.  Rebuke the Thought: Actively reject envious thoughts in Christ's name.
  - 3.  Cultivate Gratitude: Focus on God's blessings to you (Phil 4:11-13).
    - [WB]: Action Steps: 1. Confess (1 Jn 1:9) 2. Rebuke (2 Cor 10:5) 3.
      Gratitude (Phil 4:11).
  - 4.  Pray for the Person Envied: Turn resentment into blessing (Matt 5:44).
  - 5.  Focus on Christ: Behold Him to be changed (2 Cor 3:18).
  - [EB]: 1 Timothy 6:6 ("But godliness with contentment is great gain.") - Link
    contentment directly to overcoming covetousness/envy.
