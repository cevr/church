### Introduction: God’s Urgent, Loving, Final Warning (5 min)

- The Setting: Amidst the final conflict between Christ and Satan (Rev 12-13).
- Not three gospels, but one "everlasting gospel" presented in a three-fold,
  final-day context.
- [WB]: Draw a timeline: Cross -> Church History -> 1844 -> Today -> Second
  Coming. Place Rev 14 messages in the "Today" section.
- This is God’s final educational appeal, designed to restore His image in a
  people before the close of probation.
- [RQ]: Why would a God of love end earth's history with such strong warnings?
  (Ezekiel 33:11)
- The purpose: To prepare a people to stand, to reveal who is loyal to God in
  the final crisis of the Great Controversy.

### The First Angel: The Everlasting Gospel in Judgment Hour (12 min)

- **Verse Focus: Revelation 14:6-7**
- **1. "Having the everlasting gospel..." (v. 6)**
  - The foundation is grace, salvation through Christ alone (Eph 2:8-9).
  - This is not a message of fear, but of good news contextualized for the end.
  - [EB]: Romans 1:16 (Power of God unto salvation).
- **2. "...the hour of his judgment is come..." (v. 7)**
  - A present truth, not a future event. This began in 1844.
  - [WB]: Line connecting Dan 8:14 ("2300 days; then shall the sanctuary be
    cleansed") to Rev 14:7 ("judgment is come").
  - [RQ]: How does knowing our lives are being reviewed in the heavenly
    Sanctuary right now affect our daily educational process of character
    building? (2 Cor 5:10)
  - [EGW]: "The subject of the sanctuary and the investigative judgment should
    be clearly understood by the people of God. All need a knowledge for
    themselves of the position and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise it
    will be impossible for them to exercise the faith which is essential at this
    time or to occupy the position which God designs them to fill." (GC 488.2)
- **3. "...worship him that made heaven, and earth..." (v. 7)**
  - A direct call back to the Creator in an age of evolution and humanism.
  - This language points directly to the fourth commandment.
  - Read Exodus 20:8-11 – The language is nearly identical. The Sabbath is the
    seal of God as Creator.
  - [EB]: Nehemiah 9:6 (Thou hast made heaven...).

### The Second Angel: A Call of Separation from Confusion [*] (8 min)

- **Verse Focus: Revelation 14:8**
- **1. "Babylon is fallen, is fallen..."**
  - "Babylon" comes from "Babel" - confusion (Gen 11:9). Symbolizes all apostate
    religious systems.
  - Why "fallen"? Because she has rejected the first angel's message (truth
    about judgment, Creator worship) and offers the "wine" of false doctrines.
  - [WB]: List "False Doctrines (Wine)": Sunday sacredness, immortal soul,
    eternal torment, rejection of Sanctuary truth.
- **2. A Call to Unlearn Error**
  - This is a call of love, urging people to leave systems that are no longer
    aligned with biblical truth.
  - It's a crucial step in the educational journey toward restoration: you
    cannot learn the truth while clinging to error.
  - [RQ]: How can we share this message of separation without sounding
    judgmental or superior? (2 Tim 2:24-25)
  - [EB]: Revelation 18:4 ("Come out of her, my people..."). This shows the
    message is repeated with even greater power at the very end.

### The Third Angel & The Result: The Ultimate Choice and Character (14 min)

- **Verse Focus: Revelation 14:9-12**
- **1. The Warning: "...worship the beast and his image... receive his mark..."
  (v. 9-11)**
  - The most solemn warning in Scripture.
  - The "beast" (Rev 13, Dan 7) represents the system that changed God's law.
    The "mark" is the sign of allegiance to that power (Sunday observance
    enforced by law) versus God's sign of allegiance (the Sabbath).
  - [EB]: Daniel 7:25 (He shall think to change times and laws).
  - This is about worship—who has our ultimate loyalty? The Creator or the
    counterfeiter?
  - The "wrath of God" is the natural consequence of choosing separation from
    the only Source of life (Gal 6:7-8).
- **2. The Result: A People Restored (v. 12)**
  - This verse describes the character of those who heed the three messages.
    They are the final product of God's educational work.
  - [WB]: Equation: 1st Angel (Gospel/Judgment/Sabbath) + 2nd Angel
    (Separation) + 3rd Angel (Warning/Loyalty) = Rev 14:12 Character.
  - **"Here is the patience of the saints..."**
    - Enduring faithfulness through trial. Character perfected through
      tribulation (James 1:2-4).
  - **"...keep the commandments of God..."**
    - The result of true faith. Obedience is the fruit, not the root, of
      salvation. Love for God is demonstrated by keeping His law (John 14:15).
  - **"...and the faith of Jesus."**
    - Not just faith _in_ Jesus, but the same quality of trusting, dependent
      faith that Jesus Himself lived by. A complete surrender to the Father's
      will.
  - [EGW]: "When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united with His
    heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind becomes one with His mind,
    the thoughts are brought into captivity to Him; we live His life. This is
    what it means to be clothed with the garment of His righteousness." (COL
    312.1)
  - [EB]: Revelation 12:17 (Remnant character described in the same way).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- The Three Angels' Messages are not optional side-topics; they are the present
  truth, the core of the everlasting gospel for this time.
- They are God’s final, loving plea, an educational curriculum to prepare a
  people to have His image fully restored in them.
- [RQ]: Which part of this three-fold message is the Holy Spirit impressing upon
  your mind to study more deeply and apply more fully?
- This is not about being saved _by_ our obedience, but about a people so
  transformed _by_ the gospel that obedience and loyalty to God become their
  very nature.
- An invitation to accept the full gospel message for our day: to worship the
  Creator, to separate from error, and to develop the character of the saints
  who will stand ready for His coming.
