### Introduction (5 min)

- Common objections to God's Law today, especially the Fourth Commandment
  (Sabbath).
  - Briefly list a few from user input (e.g., "only for Jews," "nailed to the
    cross").
- Why understanding the Law is crucial:
  - It's a transcript of God's character (Psa 19:7).
  - It's the foundation of His government, central to the Great Controversy (Rev
    12:17).
  - [RQ]: If God's character doesn't change (Mal 3:6), can His moral law change?
- Purpose of this study: To explore Scripture, unlearn common errors, and learn
  the truth about the Law's permanence and its role in the believer's life –
  part of our "True Education" in God's ways.

### Section 1: The Law's Eternal Foundation (12 min)

_(Addresses: "Only for Jews," "Didn't exist before Moses," "Sabbath
ceremonial")_

- **A. The Law Before Sinai: Evidence of its Antiquity**
  - Genesis 2:1-3: The Sabbath instituted at Creation.
    - God blessed and sanctified the seventh day.
    - [WB]: Timeline: Creation (Sabbath Instituted) -> Fall -> Patriarchs ->
      Sinai (Law Codified).
    - [RQ]: For whom was the Sabbath made if it was instituted before any
      specific nation existed? (Gen 2:1-3, Mark 2:27)
    - This act of sanctification set it apart for holy use for all mankind.
  - Genesis 4:3-7: Cain, Abel, and sin.
    - "Sin lieth at the door" (Gen 4:7) implies knowledge of a standard/law.
    - [EB]: Romans 4:15 ("For where no law is, there is no transgression.") -
      Sin existed, so law existed.
  - Genesis 26:5: Abraham "obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments,
    my statutes, and my laws."
    - [RQ]: How could Abraham keep God's commandments and laws if they weren't
      given until Moses? (Gen 26:5)
    - This demonstrates the principles of God's law were known and kept by the
      faithful before Sinai.

- **B. The Law at Sinai: A Moral Transcript for All Time**
  - Exodus 20:1-17: The Ten Commandments spoken by God, written by His finger
    (Ex 31:18).
    - Distinct from the ceremonial/sacrificial laws later written by Moses in a
      book (Deut 31:24-26).
    - [WB]: Draw: Two Stone Tablets (Moral Law - God's writing) vs. Book of the
      Law (Ceremonial - Moses' writing).
    - The Sabbath Commandment (Exodus 20:8-11):
      - "Remember": Points back to Creation (Gen 2:1-3).
      - Includes "the stranger within thy gates" – not exclusive.
      - [RQ]: Why is the Sabbath commandment the only one that starts with
        "Remember"? What does this imply about its prior existence and
        importance?
  - [EGW]: "The law of God existed before the creation of man or else Adam could
    not have sinned... After the transgression of Adam the principles of the law
    were not changed, but were definitely arranged and expressed to meet man in
    his fallen condition." (Selected Messages, Book 1, 220.3, adapted)

- **C. The Law for All Nations**
  - Isaiah 56:2, 6-7: Blessings on "the son of man" and "strangers" (Gentiles)
    who keep the Sabbath and God's covenant.
    - [RQ]: Does Isaiah limit Sabbath-keeping and its blessings to only one
      ethnic group? (Isa 56:6-7)
    - This shows the universal design of the Sabbath and God's law.
  - [EB]: Romans 2:14-15 (Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the
    things contained in the law... shew the work of the law written in their
    hearts). This speaks to the innate moral sense, which the Decalogue
    codifies.

### Section 2: Christ, The Law-Giver and Law-Keeper [*] (12 min)

_(Addresses: "Jesus fulfilled the law (so it's gone)," "Jesus didn't explicitly
say keep Sabbath")_

- **A. Christ Did Not Abolish the Law**
  - Matthew 5:17-18 (Central Verse): "Think not that I am come to destroy the
    law... but to fulfil."
    - [WB]: "Fulfill" (Greek: _pleroo_) = To make full, to fill up its meaning,
      to perfectly exemplify. NOT to terminate or abolish.
    - [RQ]: If Jesus intended to abolish the Law, why would He say not even the
      smallest part ("jot or tittle") would pass away until all is accomplished
      (heaven and earth pass)? (Matt 5:18)
  - Matthew 5:19: Warning against breaking or teaching others to break the
    "least of these commandments."
    - [Aside]: A good driver doesn't abolish traffic laws by obeying them; they
      uphold and demonstrate their purpose. Christ, by His perfect life,
      magnified the law (Isa 42:21).

- **B. Christ Upheld and Clarified the Sabbath**
  - His example: "as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath
    day" (Luke 4:16).
  - His teaching:
    - Mark 2:27-28: "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:
      Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
      - [RQ]: When Jesus said the Sabbath was "made for man," was He abolishing
        it or restoring its true, benevolent purpose from Pharisaical burdens?
        (Mark 2:27)
      - He is Lord _of_ the Sabbath, its rightful owner and interpreter, not its
        destroyer.
    - Matthew 12:12: "Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days."
      (Healing, acts of mercy).
    - Matthew 24:20: "But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither
      on the sabbath day."
      - Spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem (AD 70), decades after
        His resurrection. Assumes its continued observance by His followers.
      - [EB]: Luke 23:56 (The women who followed Jesus "rested the sabbath day
        according to the commandment" even after His death, before knowing of
        the resurrection.)

- **C. Faith Establishes the Law**
  - Romans 3:31: "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,
    we establish the law."
    - [RQ]: How does genuine faith in Christ lead to _establishing_ or upholding
      God's law in our lives? (Rom 3:31)
    - True faith leads to transformation and a desire to live in harmony with
      God's will, which is expressed in His law. This is part of the restoration
      of God's image.

### Section 3: The Law Written on the Heart – Empowerment for Obedience (10 min)

_(Addresses: "Law in hearts = no need for deliberate keeping")_

- **A. The New Covenant Promise** - Hebrews 8:10 (quoting Jeremiah 31:33): "For
  this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind,
  and write them in their hearts..." - [WB]: Diagram: Mind (Understanding God's
  Will) + Heart (Desire/Love for God's Will) = Obedience (Action). This is True
  Education. - [RQ]: Does having the law written on the heart mean the standard
  changes, or that our internal disposition towards that unchanging standard is
  transformed? (Heb 8:10) - It's not an erasure of the objective law, but an
  internalization of it through a renewed nature.

- **B. Divine Power for Obedience**
  - Ezekiel 36:26-27: "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit... and
    I will put my spirit within you, and _cause you_ to walk in my statutes, and
    ye shall keep my judgments, and do them."
    - The Holy Spirit empowers the believer to live in accordance with God's
      law. It's not just "try harder" but divine enablement.
  - [EGW]: "The law of Ten Commandments is not to be looked upon as much from
    the prohibitory side, as from the mercy side. Its prohibitions are the sure
    guarantee of happiness in obedience... Inscribed in the heart, it will be
    the power that will bring him into subjection to Christ." (Bible Echo,
    August 15, 1898, par. 5, adapted for conciseness)

- **C. Obedience: The Fruit of Relationship and Restoration**
  - 1 John 2:3-4: "And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
    commandments. He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
    is a liar, and the truth is not in him."
    - Keeping commandments is the evidence of a genuine, saving relationship
      with Christ.
  - The Law reveals God's ideal for humanity (His image) and our need for a
    Savior (Rom 7:7).
  - Christ's righteousness is imputed (for justification) and imparted (for
    sanctification and character restoration).
  - [EB]: Daniel 7:25 (Prophecy of a power that would "think to change times and
    laws." This highlights the ongoing spiritual warfare over God's law, making
    our understanding and allegiance vital, especially concerning the Sabbath.)

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Recapitulation: God's Law is eternal, a reflection of His unchanging character
  of love, magnified by Christ, and written on the hearts of New Covenant
  believers.
  - It is not a means to _earn_ salvation (Eph 2:8-9), but the standard of
    conduct for those _already saved_ by grace.
- The Law as a delight: For the renewed heart, obedience is not a burden but a
  joy (Psa 119:35, 47; Rom 7:22).
  - This love for God's law is a key aspect of being restored in His image.
- The Final Test: God is calling out a people who, in the last days, will be
  distinguished by their loyalty to Him.
  - Revelation 14:12: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that
    keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
  - [RQ]: In light of what we've studied, how does a clear understanding and
    loving observance of God's whole law prepare us for Christ's soon return?
- Invitation: To embrace God's law, not as a legalistic code, but as an
  expression of His love and the path to true freedom and character
  transformation through Jesus Christ.
  - To seek the "new heart" experience that makes obedience a natural outflow of
    love for our Creator and Redeemer.
  - To stand firm on Bible truth against prevailing errors.
