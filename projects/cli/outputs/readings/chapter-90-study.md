Study Title: Who Changed the Sabbath? History and Prophecy

Question: What was Jesus Christ’s attitude toward the Law of God?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honorable.” (Isaiah 42:21)

Explanation: Many believe Jesus came to abolish the Ten Commandments, but prophecy stated He would "magnify" them. To magnify means to show in greater detail, clarity, and importance—not to destroy.

Question: Did Jesus confirm that the law would remain unchanged?

Biblical Answer: “For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:18)

Term Definition: "Jot" and "tittle" refer to the smallest letter and the smallest stroke of a pen in the Hebrew alphabet. Jesus emphasized that not even the tiniest punctuation of God's law would be removed as long as the earth stands.

[ILL] If a king writes a decree, only the king can change it. Jesus, as one with the Father, declared that the code of Ten Commandments remains binding. Just as a magnifying glass makes an object clearer but does not destroy it, Jesus showed the spiritual depth of the law (love), rather than deleting the letter of the law.

Question: Since Jesus didn't change the Sabbath, did the Bible predict a power that would *attempt* to change it?

Biblical Answer: “And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws...” (Daniel 7:25)

Explanation: The prophet Daniel saw a "little horn" power arising out of the Roman empire. This power would not only persecute God's people but would audaciously attempt to alter God's "times and laws."

[DYK] The Fourth Commandment is the only one in the Decalogue that deals with "time" (the seventh day). It is also the only one this power has attempted to change universally within Christendom.

Question: How was this change historically accomplished?

Biblical Answer: [Historical Record]

Explanation: The change was not immediate but gradual.
1. **Constantine's Edict (321 A.D.):** The Roman Emperor Constantine enacted the first civil law regarding Sunday. He commanded rest on "the venerable day of the sun."
2. **Council of Laodicea (364 A.D.):** The church eventually forbade Christians from "Judaizing" (resting on the Sabbath) and commanded them to work on Saturday and rest on Sunday.

[SN] The language of Constantine's law is revealing. He did not call it "The Lord's Day" or "The Sabbath," but the "venerable day of the sun." Constantine was a sun worshiper who accepted Christianity politically; the result was a blending of pagan sun-worship customs with the Christian faith.

Question: Does the Roman Church admit to making this change without Scriptural authority?

Biblical Answer: [Ecclesiastical Admissions]

Explanation: Yes. In various catechisms and doctrinal books, the Roman Catholic Church openly admits that the change from Saturday to Sunday was an act of their own ecclesiastical authority, not a command from the Bible. They state that if one follows the Bible alone (Sola Scriptura), one must keep the Saturday Sabbath.

[ILL] If you hold a map that says "Go East," but a guide tells you "Go West," you must decide whose authority to trust. The Bible maps out the seventh day; tradition maps out the first day.

Question: Why is this choice significant for a believer today?

Biblical Answer: “Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey...?” (Romans 6:16)

Explanation: Worship is, at its core, an act of obedience. When we knowingly follow a tradition established by man that contradicts a command established by God, we are honoring the authority of man over the authority of God. Jesus called this "vain worship" (Matthew 15:9).

Deeper Insight: The text draws a parallel to Elijah and the prophets of Baal. Baal was a sun god. Elijah asked, "How long halt ye between two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him" (1 Kings 18:21). Today, the question remains: Do we follow the commandment of the Lord or the "day of the sun" established by tradition?

Practical Application:
• Search the Scriptures to see if Jesus ever commanded a change.
• Consider who holds the highest authority in your life: God or religious tradition.
• Ask God for the courage to follow His "times and laws" rather than those instituted by man.
