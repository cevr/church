Slide 3 Explanation: The Scriptures present God not only as our Creator but as the Sustainer of life. Living in harmony with God's laws—both moral and natural—places a person in the best position to receive God's blessing of health.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The sanitary laws given to Moses regarding diet, hygiene, and quarantine were thousands of years ahead of their time. While other nations used harmful remedies, God’s instructions protected Israel from preventable diseases.

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.” (Matthew 8:17)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Jesus did not view physical suffering with indifference. He “took” them upon Himself, showing that the Gospel involves the restoration of the whole person—body, mind, and spirit.

[ILL] Imagine a doctor who doesn't just write a prescription but stays by the bedside, sharing the burden of the pain. This is the picture Matthew paints of Christ.

Slide 8 Question: How should the church pray for the sick today?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Is there any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick...” (James 5:14-15)

Slide 10 Elements of Prayer:
1. **Community:** It is not a solitary act; the leaders ("elders") are called.
2. **Symbolism:** Oil is used, representing the Holy Spirit and consecration.

Slide 11 Elements of Prayer:
3. **Source of Power:** It is done "in the name of the Lord," not by the power of the individual praying.

Slide 12 Term Definition: “Anointing” was a common practice in biblical times, often associated with setting something apart for holy use or for medicinal purposes. Here, it signifies committing the sick person entirely to God's care.

[SN] Note on King Asa (2 Chronicles 16:12): Asa sought "not to the Lord, but to the physicians." This is not a prohibition against medicine, but a warning against trusting *only* in human aid. True healing combines wisdom (remedies) with prayer.

Slide 13 Question: What spiritual preparation is necessary when asking for healing?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure kneeling in a quiet corner, head bowed in deep reflection and humility.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.” (James 5:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two brothers in robes grasping arms, speaking earnestly and forgiving one another.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Physical healing and spiritual forgiveness are closely linked. Before asking for a miracle, we are called to examine our hearts, confess known sins, and clear the channel between us and God.

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Unconfessed sin or a "willful course" of disobedience can hinder healing. If a person prays for health only to return to habits that destroy their health, God cannot consistently answer that prayer.

---

Slide 17 Question: Why are some prayers for healing not answered immediately?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure looking up at a silent, starry sky with a questioning but faithful expression.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.” (James 4:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person praying, but with a shadow cast over them, representing divided motives.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The deepest answer lies in submission to God’s superior wisdom. As Christ prayed in Gethsemane, true faith always adds, "Nevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done."

Slide 20 Illustration: A child may ask for a sharp knife, thinking it a toy. A loving parent refuses the request to protect the child. Similarly, God answers prayers according to what is best for our eternal good, which we cannot always see.

---

Slide 21 Practical Application:
*   **Align:** Are my lifestyle habits in harmony with God's laws of health?
*   **Confess:** Is there unconfessed sin or bitterness blocking my spiritual connection?
*   **Trust:** Am I willing to trust God's answer, whether it be immediate healing or grace to endure?

Slide 22 Conclusion: The Ultimate Healing

[SN] The ultimate healing is found in the "redemption of our body" (Romans 8:23) at the resurrection. While God heals many now, the final eradication of sickness awaits the New Earth.
