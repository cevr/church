Study Title: A Remarkable Symbol: The Church in Light

---

Slide 1 Question: How does the Bible introduce the history of the true church in the book of Revelation?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” (Revelation 12:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a majestic vision in the sky: a woman radiating light, standing atop a glowing moon, with the sun enveloping her and twelve stars shining above her head.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Prophecy often uses symbols to convey history. In the Bible, a woman represents a church. A pure, virtuous woman represents God’s faithful people, while a corrupt woman represents a corrupt church. This "great wonder" outlines the experience of God’s people transitioning from the Old Testament era into the New.

[DYK] In the Bible, the relationship between God and His people is frequently compared to a marriage. Paul writes to the church in Corinth, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:2).

Slide 4 Question: What does the "Sun" represent in this symbol?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise breaking over an ancient landscape, the golden rays illuminating the horizon with intense brightness.

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings...” (Malachi 4:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus Christ standing with outstretched arms, radiating a brilliant, warm light that banishes all surrounding darkness.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Being "clothed with the sun" represents the glory of the Gospel dispensation—the era of the New Testament. Just as the sun is the supreme source of light in the physical world, Jesus Christ and His direct gospel message are the supreme light of the spiritual world. The church is wrapped in the brightness of Christ's righteousness.

---

Slide 7 Illustration: Imagine standing at high noon in a field; there are no shadows, only brightness. This is the position of the Christian church under the Gospel—fully illuminated by the reality of Jesus, no longer looking through the dimmer light of symbols and sacrifices.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast, green field under a bright midday sun, everything is clear and vivid with absolutely no shadows cast on the ground.

---

Slide 8 Question: Why is the "Moon" under her feet, and what does it signify?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a night scene with a full moon reflecting bright silver light onto a quiet ancient city.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things...” (Hebrews 10:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an Old Testament priest performing a sacrifice near an altar, the scene lit dimly by firelight and moonlight, symbolizing the "shadow" of things to come.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: The moon has no light of its own; it merely reflects the light of the sun. Similarly, the Mosaic dispensation (the Old Testament system of sacrifices and types) shone only by reflecting the light of the coming Messiah.

To have the moon "under her feet" means she stands *upon* it as a foundation. The New Testament church stands upon the foundation of the Old Testament prophets but has risen into the superior glory of the Gospel sunlight.

Slide 11 Term Definition & Insight: 
**Dispensation**: A specific period of time in which God administers His government or reveals Himself in a specific way (e.g., the period of the sacrifices vs. the period of the Gospel).

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** Consider the beauty of this astronomical symbol. The moon (Old Testament) fades when the Sun (Christ) rises, yet the Sun gave the Moon its light all along. The sacrifices only had value because they pointed to Jesus. Once the reality (the Sun) appeared, the reflection (the Moon) was no longer the primary source, yet it remains the platform upon which the church stands.

Slide 12 Question: What is the meaning of the "Crown of Twelve Stars"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden crown floating in the air, set with twelve brilliant, diamond-like stars.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer & Explanation: The number twelve is significantly linked to the governance of God’s people. The twelve stars represent the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

As the church entered the Gospel era, the apostles were the primary lights sent forth to illuminate the darkness of the world with the testimony of Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the twelve apostles standing together, each holding a scroll or staff, with a faint star glowing above each of their heads.

---

Slide 14 Deeper Insight: 
[DYK] In the Old Testament, the High Priest wore a breastplate with twelve stones representing the twelve tribes. Here, the church wears a crown of twelve stars, representing the apostles who foundationalized the Christian church.

This vision presents the church not as a physical building, but as a dazzling, celestial body. She is clothed in light (Christ), standing on the prophetic foundation (Old Testament), and crowned with apostolic authority (New Testament).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting contrasting the High Priest's jeweled breastplate with a radiant crown of stars, symbolizing the shift from the Levitical order to the Apostolic order.

---

Slide 15 Practical Application: How does this symbol affect us today?
• It assures us that the Church is precious to God.
• It reminds us that we have the "full light" of the Gospel—we are without excuse if we walk in darkness.
• It encourages us to value both the Old and New Testaments as essential to our standing.

Slide 16 Summary: God’s church is called to reflect His light. Just as this woman is illuminated by the sun, moon, and stars, our lives should be illuminated by the fullness of Scripture.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient oil lamp, a scroll, and a bright light source combining to illuminate a dark room, symbolizing the total light of God's Word.
