---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26)

“And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” (Genesis 6:5)

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus draws a direct parallel between the antediluvian world and the end of time. The characteristics of Noah’s day—widespread wickedness and a preoccupation with earthly life while ignoring God’s warnings—will be repeated.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The "days of Noah" were not marked by ignorance, but by rebellion. Ancient traditions suggest high intellect and skill, yet these were used for evil rather than for God’s glory.

Slide 5 Question: Will society improve as we approach the end, or will times become more difficult?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “This know, also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.” (2 Timothy 3:1)

“But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.” (2 Timothy 3:13)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Contrary to the idea that humanity will evolve into a state of moral perfection, Scripture predicts "perilous times." The text lists specific moral failures: selfishness, pride, disobedience to parents, and a lack of natural affection.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd of people in a marketplace, each looking away from the other with cold expressions, symbolizing selfishness and lack of affection.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine a boat drifting down a river. Without an anchor or an engine fighting the current, it naturally drifts downstream, not up. Similarly, without the direct intervention of God, the "current" of fallen human nature drifts toward lawlessness, not holiness.

---

Slide 9 Term Definition: “Form of Godliness” (2 Tim 3:5) refers to outward religious observance—going to church, using spiritual language, or keeping rituals—without the transformational power of the Holy Spirit in the heart.

Slide 10 Question: Will the whole world eventually be converted before Jesus returns?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares... but gather the wheat into my barn.” (Matthew 13:30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting close-up of wheat stalks intertwined with dark weeds, growing together in the same soil.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The parable of the wheat and tares teaches that good (wheat) and evil (tares) will coexist until the very end. The separation does not happen through a gradual conversion of the tares into wheat, but through a decisive act of judgment at the "harvest."

Slide 13 Note on Prophecy: The "Little Horn" (Daniel 7) and the "Man of Sin" (2 Thessalonians 2) continue their work until the very moment Christ appears. They are not converted by the gospel but are destroyed by the "brightness of His coming."

---

Slide 14 Question: There is a popular teaching that nations will voluntarily lay down their weapons. How does Scripture distinguish between what people *say* and what God *predicts*?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove resting on a handle of a sword, contrasting peace and war.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer:
*What many say:* “Come... and they shall beat their swords into plowshares...” (Micah 4:2-3)
*What God warns:* “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war... beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears...” (Joel 3:9-10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a blacksmith at an anvil, hammering a farming tool into a sharp weapon, sparks flying in the gloom.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: This is a vital distinction. Micah describes what "many nations shall come and say"—a human hope for a man-made golden age. Joel records God’s direct command to prepare for the final conflict. The reality of the last days is preparation for battle, not universal peace.

---

Slide 17 Question: If the world is not going to be converted, what is the true hope of the Church?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of believers looking upward with hopeful expressions, hands clasped in prayer.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the heavens opening, a glorious golden light descending upon a dark landscape.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The Christian’s hope is not fixed on political reform or a utopia established by human hands. It is fixed on the literal, personal return of Jesus Christ. He is the one who breaks the nations "with a rod of iron" (Psalm 2:9) and establishes true righteousness.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ descending in glory, holding a scepter of iron, emanating power and justice.

---

Slide 20 Illustration: A lighthouse does not stop the storm from raging, but it provides a focus point for the ship to reach the harbor safely. The "Blessed Hope" of Christ's return is our lighthouse in the midst of a darkening world.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sturdy stone lighthouse standing firm amidst crashing waves and a dark storm, beaming a strong light.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: The text mentions that the wicked cry "Peace and safety" just before destruction comes (1 Thess 5:3). This suggests that right before the end, there may be a global illusion of security or a counterfeit peace that blinds many to the reality of Judgment.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application:
1. Are we holding to the "power" of godliness, or just the "form"?
2. Are we looking for earthly security, or is our focus on the "Blessed Hope"?
3. Are we prepared to stand as "wheat" even when surrounded by "tares"?
