Study Title: The Sure Word of Prophecy

---

Slide 1 Question: What is the source and purpose of the Holy Scriptures?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a thoughtful scribe sitting at a wooden table, quill in hand, looking upward into a soft ray of light for inspiration.

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible is not merely the product of human genius. "Inspiration" literally means "God-breathed." God communicated His mind to humanity to equip us for a righteous life. It is the manual that furnishes us for every good work.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know?
[DYK] The word "Scripture" (graphe) simply means "writing," but in the New Testament, it is used exclusively to refer to the sacred, authoritative writings of the Old Testament and later the New Testament.

---

Slide 5 Question: Did the prophecies of the Bible originate from the prophets' own ideas?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophet standing on a hillside at dusk, listening intently to the wind, not writing but waiting.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Holy Spirit symbolized as a gentle dove or wind, moving the robes and guiding the hand of a writing prophet.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: No biblical prophecy was an invention or "private interpretation" (personal impulse) of the human writer. The Holy Spirit moved upon them, guiding their thoughts and words to convey God's message, not their own.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of prophets in a circle, heads bowed, listening to a central source of light.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: The Ship and the Wind
[ILL] Think of a sailing ship. The ship (the prophet) has a unique shape and captain, but it cannot move effectively without the wind (the Holy Spirit). The Spirit fills the sails and drives the vessel in the direction God intends.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wooden sailing ship on a calm sea, its sails billowed full by a strong unseen wind, bathed in sunset light.

---

Slide 9 Term Definition
**Moved** (Greek: *phero*): Implies being carried along or borne up. It suggests that the prophets were carried by a power outside themselves.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure being gently supported and carried by invisible hands or angels, metaphorical and artistic.

---

Slide 10 Question: Who was the active agent inspiring the Old Testament prophets?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an Old Testament patriarch looking at a shadow that forms the distinct shape of a cross.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “...the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.” (1 Peter 1:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophet having a vision in the clouds of the suffering Messiah and the glory to follow.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: It is a profound truth that the Spirit of Christ was active before His incarnation. The prophets were guided by the Spirit of Jesus to write about the coming Messiah. The entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, centers on Him.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the pre-incarnate Christ appearing as a being of light to an ancient writer, historically respectful.

---

Slide 13 Question: How reliable is the prophetic Word compared to personal experiences?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man looking unsure about a dream or vision, contrasted with a man standing on a rock holding a scroll.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn...” (2 Peter 1:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single, bright oil lamp shining in a dark, cavernous place, creating a clear circle of safety.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The Apostle Peter had witnessed the majesty of Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration with his own eyes. Yet, he declares the written prophecies to be "more sure" than even his own vision. Our faith stands on the solid rock of Scripture, not on fleeting feelings or senses.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter, James, and John shielding their eyes from the overwhelming glory on the Mount of Transfiguration.

---

Slide 16 Speaker Notes & Insight
[SN] Spirit-led expansion:
*   This text establishes the Protestant principle of *Sola Scriptura*. Experiences and miracles must be tested by the "more sure" standard of the written Word.
*   The "day star" (Phosphoros) refers to the planet Venus, the morning star that heralds the sunrise—symbolizing Christ's return.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the morning star rising brightly over a landscape just before the break of dawn.

---

Slide 17 Question: Are we permitted to understand the prophecies, specifically the book of Revelation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large book with seven seals, one of the seals being broken open.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him... Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.” (Revelation 1:1, 3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle John on the island of Patmos, looking up in awe as the heavens open above him.

---

Slide 19 Explanation & Insight: Far from being a sealed book impossible to understand, it is called a "Revelation."

[DYK] The Greek word for Revelation is *Apokalypsis*, which means "uncovering" or "disclosure." It is not meant to confuse, but to reveal Jesus Christ in His glory.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavy velvet curtain being pulled back to reveal a glimpse of a glorious throne room.

---

Slide 20 Question: What about the prophecies of Daniel? Were they always meant to be fully understood?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel, aged and wise, looking at a scroll with a look of longing and mystery.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an angel instructing Daniel to roll up a scroll and seal it with wax.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: While Revelation is an open book, portions of Daniel were "sealed" until a specific period called "the time of the end." Jesus Himself pointed back to Daniel (Matthew 24:15), indicating that in the last days, the study of these prophecies would lead to an increase in knowledge.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an hourglass with the sand nearly run out, sitting beside an open book of Daniel.

---

Slide 23 Deeper Insight: "Running to and fro"
This phrase is often interpreted in two ways that harmonize:
1.  The literal increase in travel and science in the last days.
2.  The diligent searching back and forth through the Scriptures to understand the time prophecies as the end approaches.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of scholars in a great library, diligently searching through stacks of scrolls, late afternoon light streaming in.

---

Slide 24 Question: To whom do the truths of the Bible belong?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father holding a scroll, teaching his children in a tent, intimate and warm.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever.” (Deuteronomy 29:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast, starry night sky (representing secret things) above a campfire where a family reads a scroll (revealed things).

---

Slide 26 Explanation: God in His infinite wisdom retains some mysteries, but everything He has revealed in Scripture is our property. It is a heritage given to us and our children to study, cherish, and obey.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application
Since we have a "sure word of prophecy," how should we treat the Bible today?
*   Read it with confidence, knowing it is God-breathed.
*   Trust it more than emotions.
*   Study the prophecies to know where we are in history.
*   Claim the blessing promised to those who read and keep God's Word.
