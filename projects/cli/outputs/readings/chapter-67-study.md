Study Title: The Spirit of Elijah: A Message for the Last Days

Question: According to prophecy, who was predicted to appear before the final "Day of the Lord"?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.” (Malachi 4:5)

Explanation: The prophet Malachi closes the Old Testament with a promise. Before God concludes history, a special work of preparation—identified by the name "Elijah"—will take place.

[DYK] The name Elijah (Eliyahu) means "My God is Yahweh" (or Jehovah). His very name was a protest against the idolatry of his time.

Question: Did Jesus identify a fulfillment of this prophecy in His day?

Biblical Answer: “And if ye will receive it, this is Elias [Elijah], which was for to come.” (Matthew 11:14)

Explanation: Jesus identified John the Baptist as a fulfillment of this prophecy. However, when asked directly, "Art thou Elias?" John answered, "I am not" (John 1:21).

Term Definition: **"Spirit and Power"**: The Bible resolves this apparent contradiction in Luke 1:17. John was not the *reincarnation* of the literal Elijah; rather, he went forth "in the spirit and power of Elias." He had the same boldness, the same simple lifestyle, and the same mission to call people to repentance.

Question: Since John the Baptist died long ago, is there a future work for the "Spirit of Elijah"?

Biblical Answer: “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and the terrible day of the Lord come.” (Joel 2:31)

Explanation: The "great and terrible day of the Lord" (the Second Coming) is still future. Peter describes it as the time when "the heavens shall pass away with a great noise" (2 Peter 3:10). Therefore, just as John the Baptist prepared the way for Christ's *first* coming, there must be a movement in the "spirit and power of Elijah" to prepare the world for His *second* coming.

[ILL] Think of an ambassador sent ahead of a King to ensure the road is clear and the people are ready to receive Him. This is the function of the Elijah message.

Question: What is the core message of the Elijah spirit?

Biblical Answer: “How long halt ye between two opinions? If the Lord be God, follow Him: but if Baal, then follow him.” (1 Kings 18:21)

Explanation: Elijah’s message is a call to radical decision. It exposes the middle ground as dangerous. In Elijah's day, the people tried to worship both the true God and the idol Baal. The message forces a choice: Who is your Master?

Deeper Insight: In the context of Revelation 14:9-12, this same call is repeated by the Third Angel. The choice is no longer between Yahweh and Baal, but between the "Seal of God" (worshiping the Creator) and the "Mark of the Beast" (false worship).

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangent: The parallel between Queen Jezebel and the "Woman" of Revelation 17. Just as Jezebel introduced illicit worship into Israel and persecuted God’s true prophet, Revelation describes a corrupt church power that persecutes the saints and introduces false doctrines, against which the end-time Elijah must testify.

Question: How will the world generally treat those who deliver this message?

Biblical Answer: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelation 12:17)

Explanation: Just as Ahab accused Elijah of being the one who "troubleth Israel" (1 Kings 18:17), the end-time people of God—the remnant—will be viewed as troublemakers because they refuse to compromise with false worship (the Beast and his image).

Progressive Disclosure:
*   **Elijah's trial**: Persecuted by the state (Ahab) and false religion (Jezebel).
*   **The Remnant's trial**: Revelation 13:15 warns of a decree that those who do not worship the image of the beast should be killed.
*   **The outcome**: Deliverance.

Question: What happened to the literal Elijah, offering hope to the end-time faithful?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, there appeared a chariot of fire... and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.” (2 Kings 2:11)

Explanation: Elijah is one of only two men in the Bible (along with Enoch) taken to heaven without seeing death. This is a "type" or foreshadowing of the faithful who will be alive when Jesus returns—they will be translated (taken to heaven) without dying.

[SN] The "Sea of Glass" in Revelation 15:2 depicts the victorious saints standing with harps. This mirrors Elijah's victory. They have overcome the Beast, just as Elijah overcame the prophets of Baal.

Practical Application:
The spirit of Elijah calls us to examine our hearts today:
*   Are we "halting between two opinions"?
*   Are we trying to follow popular culture while claiming to follow Christ?
*   God is calling for a people who will "keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus" (Rev 14:12) regardless of what the world says.
