Study Title: Righteousness and the Gift of Life

Question: What is the fundamental assurance given to everyone who believes in Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)

Explanation: This is the bedrock of the Gospel. The text establishes a stark contrast: perishing versus living forever. The condition for this life is not earning it, but believing in the One who gave it.

[DYK] The Greek word for "believeth" in this text implies a continuous action—"whosoever goes on believing." It describes a living, ongoing trust rather than a one-time intellectual assent.

Question: What is revealed through the Gospel message regarding how we live?

Biblical Answer: “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.” (Romans 1:17)

Explanation: The Gospel brings "righteousness" (right doing/right being) to light. The scripture emphasizes that spiritual life is sustained by faith from start to finish.

[SN] Use of "The just shall live by faith": This text was the catalyst for the Protestant Reformation. For the SDA pioneer, this speaks to the "Third Angel's Message" in verify—justification by faith is the work of God in man, fitting him for glory.

Question: How closely are "righteousness" and "life" connected in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.” (Proverbs 12:28)

Explanation: Often, we view righteousness as a set of rules and "eternal life" as a reward given later. Solomon, the wise writer of Proverbs, suggests they are the same thing. To be in the way of righteousness *is* to be in the way of life. Sin is simply the mechanism of death; righteousness is the mechanism of life.

[ILL] Consider a fish in water. The water is the "righteous environment" for the fish. To stay in the water is life; to leave it is death. God’s righteousness is the atmosphere in which human beings were designed to exist.

Question: Since we have sinned, we cannot generate this righteousness ourselves. Who is the Source?

Biblical Answer: “And this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.” (Jeremiah 23:6)

Explanation: We do not produce righteousness; we receive a Person who *is* Righteousness. Jeremiah predicts the coming of Christ, noting that His very name identifies Him as the supply of our needs.

Term Definition: "Imputed Righteousness" – This is a theological term meaning that Christ’s perfect history is credited to our account. We are treated as if we had lived His perfect life.

Question: If Christ is our Righteousness, what is the standard or definition of that righteousness?

Biblical Answer: “All Thy commandments are righteousness.” (Psalm 119:172)

Explanation: The Ten Commandments are not arbitrary rules; they are a transcript of God’s character. If God is righteous, His law describes what that righteousness looks like in action. Therefore, Jesus said, “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments” (Matthew 19:17), because the commandments describe the lifestyle of heaven.

Deeper Insight: There is perfect harmony between the Law and the Gospel. The Law reveals the standard of righteousness (Psalm 119:172), and the Gospel provides the power to meet that standard through Jesus (Romans 1:16).

Question: How do we receive this experience of righteousness and life? Is it a wage we earn?

Biblical Answer: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

Explanation: A wage is something you are owed because you worked for it. The only thing humanity has "earned" is death. Eternal life is a "gift." You cannot work for a gift; you can only accept it with gratitude.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The concept of the "Gift." In the Sanctuary service, the sinner brought a lamb. The sinner did not kill himself for his sin; the lamb took the death. The life of the lamb was accepted in place of the sinner. Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.

Question: How does this gift actually change our hearts and behavior?

Biblical Answer: "Christ is the source of every right impulse... And as Christ draws them to look upon His cross... the commandment comes home to the conscience... They begin to comprehend something of the righteousness of Christ." (Source: *Steps to Christ* / *Happiness Digest*, p. 30)

Explanation: We do not change our habits *in order* to come to Christ; we come to Christ, and His love changes our habits. As we look at the Cross ("beholding the Lamb"), we realize the cost of sin. This goodness of God leads us to repentance.

[ILL] The Magnet: A piece of iron does not need to struggle to move toward a magnet; it simply yields to the pull. Jesus said, "If I be lifted up... I will draw all men unto me." His love is the magnet. Our part is to stop resisting the pull.

Practical Application:
• **Assurance**: Do you doubt your standing with God? Remember, "The Lord is our Righteousness." It depends on Him, not you.
• **Action**: Are you struggling with a specific sin? Instead of fighting it in the dark, turn on the "Light" by spending time beholding Christ in the Word.
• **Hope**: The path of righteousness has "no death" in it. Even if we sleep in the grave, our life is hid with Christ.
