Study Title: Resting in Him: The Manner of Observing the Sabbath

Question: How are we commanded to treat the Sabbath day?

Biblical Answer: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8)

Explanation: The command is two-fold: to "remember" a day that is easily forgotten in the rush of life, and to "keep it holy." We do not *make* it holy; God made it holy at Creation. Our duty is to preserve that holiness by refraining from common labor and dedicating the time to God.

Question: When does the Sabbath actually begin and end according to the Bible?

Biblical Answer: “From even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.” (Leviticus 23:32)
“...at even, at the going down of the sun.” (Deuteronomy 16:6)

Explanation: In Scripture, a day does not begin at midnight. It begins at sunset ("even"). Just as in Creation, "the evening and the morning were the first day" (Genesis 1:5). Therefore, the Sabbath begins Friday evening at sunset and concludes Saturday evening at sunset.

[DYK] In Mark 1:32, the people waited until "at even, when the sun did set" to bring the sick to Jesus for healing, because they understood the Sabbath ended at sunset.

[SN] **The Theological Rhythm of Time:** God reckons the day starting with evening (rest/darkness) followed by morning (activity/light). This suggests that we rest in God first before we can work effectively. We begin our day by resting in His provision.

Question: What kind of work is appropriate for the six working days, and what is excluded from the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work.” (Exodus 20:9)

Explanation: The command distinguishes between "thy work" (secular labor, career, housework, personal gain) and God's work. "Thy work" is to be done during the six days.

Question: Is all activity forbidden on the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.” (Matthew 12:12)

Explanation: Jesus clarified that the Sabbath was not meant to stop acts of mercy. Helping the sick, relieving suffering, or caring for basic needs (like an ox in a ditch) is "doing well."

[ILL] Think of the difference between a doctor running a clinic for profit (business) and a doctor stopping to help an injured person on the roadside (mercy). The first is "thy work"; the second is the work of God, which is lawful on the Sabbath.

Question: How should we handle food and household duties?

Biblical Answer: “Bake that which ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.” (Exodus 16:23)

Term Definition: **"Seethe"** is an older English term meaning to boil or stew.

Explanation: God instructed the Israelites to prepare their food on the sixth day (Friday) so that the Sabbath would not be spent in cooking and cleaning. This renders the Sabbath a day of freedom from household burdens.

[DYK] The manna provided a weekly double-miracle: On Fridays, they gathered double, and on Sabbath, the leftovers did not spoil—something that happened on no other day of the week.

Question: Is the Sabbath merely for staying home, or is it a time for gathering?

Biblical Answer: “The seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy convocation.” (Leviticus 23:3)
“And He came to Nazareth... and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” (Luke 4:16)

Term Definition: **"Convocation"** means a commanded assembly or a calling together of the people.

Explanation: While it is a day of rest, it is also a day for community worship. Jesus set the example by making it His "custom" to be in God's house on the Sabbath.

Question: What should be our heart attitude while observing the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable...” (Isaiah 58:13)

Explanation: This verse describes a shift in focus. We turn away from "our pleasure" (our hobbies, business, and secular entertainment) to find "delight" in God's presence. It is not a day of gloom, but an "honorable" appointment with the Creator.

[SN] **"Turn away thy foot":** This idiom suggests that in our daily walk, we are treading on common ground. When we reach the Sabbath hours, we must stop and realize we are stepping onto holy ground—much like Moses at the burning bush.

Deeper Insight: The Sabbath is the bridge between the spiritual and the physical. By observing a specific time in a specific manner, we acknowledge that God is the owner of our time and the sustainer of our lives.

Practical Application: How can we make the Sabbath a delight today?
• **Preparation:** Use Friday to finish cleaning, shopping, and cooking so the sunset brings peace, not panic.
• **Nature:** Spend time in God's "second book"—creation.
• **Service:** Visit the sick or discouraged (doing well).
• **Disconnect:** Turn off secular media to tune into God's voice.
