Study Title: Evidences of Acceptance with God

---

Slide 1 Question: Since our natural human nature is opposed to God, how can we be accepted by Him?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “In every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.” (Acts 10:35)

---

Slide 3 The Dilemma: The Bible states that the "carnal mind is enmity against God" (Rom. 8:7). God accepts righteousness, but naturally, humans are unrighteous.

Definition: "Carnal mind" refers to the natural, unrenewed human disposition which seeks self-interest rather than God's will.

Slide 4 The Solution: A supernatural change is required.

“Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God.” (1 Peter 1:23)

Slide 5 Word Study: Born Again

[DYK] The phrase "born again" in Greek (*anothen*) can mean both "born again" and "born from above." This highlights that our spiritual life must have a heavenly origin, not an earthly one.

---

Slide 6 Question: Is this acceptance and forgiveness something we earn, or is it a gift?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pair of weary, empty hands held open in a gesture of receiving.

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.” (Eph. 1:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the cross in the distance, silhouetted against a sunrise, with soft golden light flooding the foreground.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: Forgiveness is not a wage paid for work done; it is a "pure act of grace." We are accepted not because of our merit, but because of the merit of Jesus.

[ILL] Imagine a person drowning in debt. If a benefactor pays the debt off, the debtor is free. The debtor did not "earn" the freedom by worrying; they simply received the payment made by another.

---

Slide 9 Deeper Insight: Faith is not a "work" that merits reward. Faith is simply the hand that reaches out to accept what Christ has already provided. All the merit resides in the Giver (Christ), not the receiver.

Slide 10 Question: How can a believer be sure of this relationship with God?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.” (Rom. 8:16)

“Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.” (1 John 4:13)

---

Slide 12 Explanation: God does not leave His children in doubt. The relationship changes from Judge/Accused to Father/Child.

[SN] In Roman law, "Adoption" was absolute and irreversible. The "witness" of the Spirit is an internal conviction that withstands external doubt.

---

Slide 13 Question: What are the internal and external evidences that a person has been truly converted?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lush fruit tree standing out in a garden.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: 

**Internal:** “For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.” (Rom. 7:22)
**External:** “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Gal. 5:22, 23)

Slide 15 Illustration: The Tree and the Label

You identify a tree by its fruit, not by the label on its trunk. A person may claim to be a Christian (the label), but the fruit (character and obedience) reveals the true nature of the tree.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gardener examining the fruit on a branch, focused and attentive.

---

Slide 16 Definition: Delight in the Law

"Delight in the law" indicates a change of heart. The unconverted person sees God's law as a restriction; the converted person sees it as a transcript of the Father's character and loves it.

---

Slide 17 Question: Can we produce this righteous fruit by our own effort?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a withered branch lying on the ground, separated from the tree.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me.” (John 15:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a thick, healthy vine with many branches connected to it, laden with grapes.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Just as a severed branch instantly begins to die, a Christian separated from daily communion with Christ cannot produce fruit. Acceptance is sustained by "abiding"—a continuous, living connection.

[SN] "Abiding" relates to the "burning heart" experience of the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:32). It is the opening of the Scriptures and the presence of Jesus that fuels spiritual life.

Slide 20 Practical Application: How do I check my spiritual condition today?

*   Do I have peace even in trouble?
*   Do I delight in God's instructions or resent them?
*   Am I trying to produce fruit by effort, or by spending time with Jesus?
*   Invite Jesus to "sup" with you today (Rev 3:20).
