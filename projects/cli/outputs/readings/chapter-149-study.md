Study Title: God's Ownership and the Support of the Ministry

Question: Who is the true owner of the world's wealth and resources?

Biblical Answer: “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Haggai 2:8); “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.” (Psalm 50:10)

Explanation: While humans possess property, the Bible teaches that God retains ultimate ownership as the Creator. We are not owners in the absolute sense, but stewards—managers entrusted with goods that belong to another.

[ILL] Consider a cashier at a store. Thousands of dollars may pass through their hands daily, but they do not own that money. They handle it according to the owner's instructions. Similarly, we manage the resources God places in our hands.

Question: What are the spiritual dangers of forgetting God’s ownership and focusing on accumulating wealth?

Biblical Answer: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.” (1 Timothy 6:9)

Term Definition: “Snare” refers to a trap used to catch animals. The text suggests that the pursuit of wealth for its own sake is a trap that entangles the soul, leading to spiritual ruin.

[DYK] In the ancient world, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor, yet Jesus and the apostles frequently warned that it could become a barrier to faith if it replaced trust in the "living God" (1 Timothy 6:17).

Question: How does God instruct us to acknowledge His ownership and honor Him?

Biblical Answer: “Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase.” (Proverbs 3:9); “And all the tithe of the land... is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.” (Leviticus 27:30)

Explanation: To "honor" God means to give Him the primary place. The "tithe" constitutes a specific portion—one tenth—of our income or increase. The Bible declares this portion to be "holy," meaning it is set apart specifically for God's use, not our own.

Question: Was the system of tithing only for the Old Testament Jews, or does it extend to the Christian dispensation?

Biblical Answer: “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” (1 Corinthians 9:14); “These ought ye to have done [paid tithe], and not to leave the other undone.” (Matthew 23:23)

Progressive Disclosure: • **Ancient Origin:** Tithing predates the law of Moses; Abraham paid tithe to Melchizedek (Hebrews 7:1-2). • **Old Testament Method:** The Levites (ministers) were supported by the tithe (Numbers 18:21). • **New Testament Application:** Paul argues that "even so" (in the same manner), gospel workers are to be supported. • **Christ’s Approval:** Jesus validated the practice of tithing while emphasizing the need for justice and mercy.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The book of Hebrews connects tithing to the priesthood of Melchizedek. Abraham, the father of the faithful, paid tithe to Melchizedek. Christ is our High Priest "after the order of Melchizedek" (Hebrews 6:20). If we are truly Abraham's spiritual children (Galatians 3:29), we do the works of Abraham, supporting the ministry of Christ on earth through the tithe.

Question: What does God promise to those who faithfully return the tithe to His "storehouse"?

Biblical Answer: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse... and prove me now herewith... if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” (Malachi 3:10)

Deeper Insight: God issues a challenge to "prove" (test) Him. This is one of the few places in Scripture where God invites us to test His faithfulness. The "storehouse" implies a centralized treasury where the means are gathered to support the organized work of God, ensuring "meat in mine house"—sustenance for the ministry.

[ILL] Imagine a garden hose. As long as it stays connected to the spigot and allows water to flow through it, it stays wet and useful. If we allow God’s blessings to flow through us to support His work, He ensures we are sustained. If we block the flow, we cut ourselves off from the source.

Practical Application: How do we apply this principle of stewardship today?
• **Recognition:** We acknowledge God provides the "power to get wealth" (Deut. 8:18).
• **Regularity:** We set aside the tithe first, before other expenses.
• **Support:** We understand that this system is God's chosen method to support the spreading of the Gospel worldwide.
• **Trust:** We trust that 90% with God’s blessing will go further than 100% without it.
