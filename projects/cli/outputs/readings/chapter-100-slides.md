---

Slide 1 Question: Who established the Sabbath, and to whom does it belong?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “In six days the Lord made the heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11) ... “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” (Exodus 20:10)

Slide 3 Explanation: The Sabbath is not a human invention, nor does it belong to any specific nation. It was established at Creation by God Himself. Because it is the "Sabbath of the Lord," He retains sole jurisdiction over it.

[DYK] The text explicitly calls it the "Sabbath of the Lord," not the "Sabbath of the Jews." It was given to mankind at Creation, long before the existence of the Jewish nation.

Slide 4 Question: Since the Sabbath belongs to God, does the civil government have authority over it?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.” (Mark 12:17)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Jesus drew a clear line between civil duty and religious duty. We owe authorities respect and taxes ("Caesar"). However, worship is a "thing that is God's." When the state legislates religious observance, it steps into God's territory.

[ILL] A coin bears the image of the ruler, so it is rendered to the ruler. The Sabbath bears the seal of the Creator (Exodus 20:11), so it must be rendered only to God.

Slide 7 Question: To whom are we accountable for our religious decisions?

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God.” (Romans 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a great judgment seat, bathed in brilliant, pure light, with a humble soul standing before it.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: Accountability in spiritual matters is individual and direct to God. No government can answer for an individual in the judgment; therefore, no government should dictate the individual's conscience.

Slide 10 Question: Why is Sabbath legislation inherently religious rather than civil?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8); “The seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation.” (Leviticus 23:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient congregation gathered peacefully for worship, wearing simple robes.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The Bible defines the Sabbath as "holy" and a time for "holy convocation." Because the day's nature is religious, any law enforcing its observance is an act of religious legislation.

Slide 13 Term Definition: **Religious Legislation**
Laws enacted by the state that enforce religious dogmas or practices. As noted in the text, this unites church and state, historically leading to intolerance and persecution.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight**: The pioneers of the Advent movement strongly advocated for the separation of church and state. They recognized that whenever the church uses the arm of the state to enforce its decrees, the power of love is replaced by the power of force.

---

Slide 14 Question: When did civil governments first begin to legislate regarding a day of rest?

---

Slide 15 Historical Answer: “On the venerable Day of the Sun let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest, and let all workshops be closed.” (Constantine’s Sunday Law, March 7, 321 A.D.)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Emperor Constantine seated on a throne, holding a decree, with Roman banners in the background.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The first Sunday law was found in the decrees of the Roman Emperor Constantine, not the Bible. It commanded rest on the "venerable Day of the Sun," blending pagan sun worship with nominal Christianity.

[DYK] Constantine's law was not absolute; it allowed farmers to continue working. This reveals the law was based on human expediency and economics, not on the unchangeable command of God.

Slide 17 Question: How did the church respond to those who wished to remain faithful to the biblical Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of early believers huddled together in a hidden room, reading a scroll by lamplight.

---

Slide 18 Historical Answer: The Council of Laodicea decreed that if Christians persisted in resting on the Sabbath, “they shall be shut out from Christ.”

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a church council meeting, with bishops debating seriously around a large table.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: The Council of Laodicea pronounced a curse (anathema) on those keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. This stands in contrast to God, who pronounced a blessing on the seventh day (Genesis 2:3). We must choose between the blessing of God and the anathema of men.

Slide 20 Practical Application:
1. **Loyalty**: Will we render to God what is His, even if culture dictates otherwise?
2. **Liberty**: Do we value and protect the freedom of conscience for all people?
3. **Source of Truth**: Do we follow the "Sabbath of the Lord" found in Scripture, or the "Day of the Sun" established by tradition?
