Slide 3 Explanation: The primary mission of Jesus was a rescue mission. He did not come merely to teach a moral code or set a good example, but to intervene in a desperate situation—saving humanity from the condition of sin.

[DYK] The name "Jesus" (Yeshua in Hebrew) literally means "The Lord Saves" or "Salvation." His very name describes His mission.

Slide 6 Explanation: This is a vital distinction. He does not just save us from the *penalty* of sin (death), but from the sin itself. Salvation is a process of being delivered from the power and practice of sinning, restoring us to a relationship with God.

Slide 7 Illustration: Imagine a doctor who pays a sick patient's hospital bill but leaves the patient dying of the disease. That is not a complete cure. Jesus pays the debt (forgiveness) *and* provides the cure (healing the heart from sin).

Slide 8 Question: Is salvation found in anyone else, or in any other philosophy?

Slide 10 Term Definition: **"Salvation"** (Greek: *sōtēria*) implies deliverance, preservation, safety, and healing. It is holistic—covering the soul, the mind, and ultimately the body at the resurrection.

Slide 11 Question: Is salvation a one-time event that cannot be forfeited, or does it require perseverance?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matthew 24:13)

Slide 13 Explanation: The Bible describes salvation as a relationship that must be maintained. Just as a marriage requires ongoing faithfulness, our relationship with Christ requires "enduring to the end."

Slide 14 Speaker Note: [SN] The source text references the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matt 18). In that story, a servant was fully forgiven a massive debt. However, when he refused to show mercy to others, his debt was reinstated. This teaches that God’s grace is transformative; if we accept His forgiveness but refuse to let it change our character, we step out of His salvation. See Ezekiel 18:24.

Slide 15 Question: Since we must endure, when is our salvation fully realized?

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.” (Romans 13:11)

Slide 17 Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Justification**: We are saved from the *penalty* of sin (Past/Present).
2.  **Sanctification**: We are being saved from the *power* of sin (Present process).
3.  **Glorification**: We will be saved from the *presence* of sin (Future event).

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: The Apostle Peter writes that we are "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time" (1 Peter 1:5). While we have the assurance of acceptance now, the full reality of rescue—eternal life in a sinless world—occurs at the Second Coming of Jesus.

Slide 19 Question: How do we obtain this life right now?

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.” (1 John 5:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding a glowing heart or light, offering it to a follower.

Slide 21 Explanation: Eternal life is not a commodity God hands us separate from Himself. Eternal life is found *in* a Person. If you have Jesus—through faith, surrender, and an indwelling Spirit—you have the life.

Slide 22 Illustration: If you have a seed, you have the entire future tree within your hand, even if it hasn't grown yet. In the same way, if you have Christ (the Seed), you possess eternal life now, which will fully bloom in the resurrection.

Slide 23 Question: Was this plan of salvation an afterthought, or was it planned long ago?

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “...the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gentle lamb standing near an ancient scroll, bathed in heavenly light.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: Before the first sin was ever committed, God had a plan to save humanity through the sacrifice of His Son. It was not a "Plan B," but an eternal purpose of love.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of God looking down upon the earth with an expression of deep, sacrificial love.

---

Slide 26 Practical Application: Since salvation is a daily walk, ask yourself today:
*   Am I harboring unforgiveness like the unmerciful servant?
*   Am I letting Jesus save me *from* my sins today, or just asking for coverage while I keep sinning?
*   Do I have the assurance that comes from "having the Son"?

Slide 27 Invitation: God invites you to take the "water of life freely" (Rev 22:17) and begin the journey today.
