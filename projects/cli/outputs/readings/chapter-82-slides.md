---

Slide 1 Question: Under the ancient civil laws of Israel, how were severe sins like idolatry, blasphemy, and adultery punished?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer:
*   **Idolatry:** “...thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die...” (Deut. 13:6-10)
*   **Blasphemy:** “...all the congregation shall certainly stone him...” (Lev. 24:16)
*   **Adultery:** “The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.” (Lev. 20:10)
*   **Rebellion:** “...all the men of his city shall stone him...” (Deut. 21:18-21)

Slide 3 Explanation: In the "old dispensation," Israel was a theocracy—a nation where God was the direct civil Ruler. These harsh penalties were civil laws designed to protect the community from the spreading "infection" of moral collapse. They demonstrate the extreme seriousness of sin in the eyes of a holy God.

Slide 4 Insight: Community Responsibility

[DYK] In these ancient cases, the "congregation" or "men of the city" participated in the punishment. This was not a secret execution by a king, but a public purging of evil to ensure the community realized the gravity of turning away from the Source of Life.

Slide 5 Illustration: The Quarantine

[ILL] Think of a quarantine. When a deadly, contagious virus appears, strict measures are taken to isolate and remove the threat to save the population. In the camp of Israel, open rebellion and idolatry were treated as a deadly spiritual plague that had to be stopped before it destroyed the whole nation.

Slide 6 Question: Since we no longer stone sinners today, has the ultimate penalty for sin been abolished?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “For the wages of sin is death.” (Rom. 6:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a withered tree in a barren landscape, contrasted with a vibrant, living tree in the distance, soft light.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: The *method* of civil punishment has changed, but the spiritual *result* of sin remains the same. Sin cuts a person off from God, who is the only source of life. Therefore, the inevitable result of clinging to sin is the cessation of life.

Slide 9 Term Definition: Wages

**Wages** (Greek: *opsōnion*). This term referred to the payment given to a soldier or servant. It implies something earned or deserved. We earn death by our sinful nature and choices; we receive eternal life as a free gift.

Slide 10 Question: Why do gospel ministers and the church not execute these death penalties today?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” (2 Cor. 5:20)

---

Slide 12 Explanation: We are now in the "Gospel dispensation." The church is not a civil government with the power of the sword. Instead, followers of Jesus are "ambassadors"—representatives sent into a foreign land to deliver the King's offer of pardon.

Slide 13 Spirit-Led Tangent: The Time of Probation

[SN] The shift from "executioner" to "ambassador" highlights that we live in a time of probation. God is holding back judgment to allow the Gospel to spread. The sword of steel has been replaced by the Sword of the Spirit (the Word of God), which cuts to the heart to save, rather than to the body to kill.

Slide 14 Question: If the church does not punish sin, who does vengeance belong to?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic sky with clouds parting, looking upward, symbolizing looking to heaven for justice.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Vengeance is Mine. I will repay, saith the Lord.” (Rom. 12:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a divine throne room seen from a distance, shrouded in holy light and mystery.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Justice has not been forgotten; it has been deferred to the One who can judge perfectly. Humans often judge by appearance, but God judges the heart. Therefore, the right to execute final justice belongs solely to Him.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a light shining directly into the chest of a person, illuminating the heart, symbolizing divine knowing.

---

Slide 17 Question: Who has been given the specific authority to execute this final judgment, and when will it happen?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ standing with authority, holding a scroll, looking compassionate yet regal.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer:
*   **The Judge:** “...hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.” (John 5:26, 27)
*   **The Time:** “Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.” (Jude 14-15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the heavens opening, with a glorious figure descending accompanied by angels, soft golden and white light.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The Father has committed all judgment to Jesus. Because Jesus lived as a man ("Son of Man"), He is a sympathetic and fair Judge who understands our temptations. This judgment is executed at His Second Coming. Until then, the door of mercy remains open.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting with common people, listening intently, showing his humanity and sympathy.

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: Ancient Knowledge

The text in Jude quotes Enoch, "the seventh from Adam." This shows that the plan of final judgment was known even by the earliest patriarchs. They understood that while sin might flourish for a time, a day of reckoning is coming when the Lord will set the universe right.

Slide 21 Illustration: The Courtroom

[ILL] A courtroom trial often has a long period of gathering evidence before the verdict is read. We are currently in the time where the evidence is being shown—God's character vs. Satan's rebellion. When Jesus returns, the court session ends, and the executive judgment begins.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of ancient scales of justice balancing in a dimly lit room, waiting for the final weight to be added.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application

1.  **Reverence:** Do not take sin lightly just because judgment isn't immediate.
2.  **Mission:** As ambassadors, warn the world and offer peace while there is time.
3.  **Trust:** Let go of personal revenge; Jesus will handle all injustice perfectly.
