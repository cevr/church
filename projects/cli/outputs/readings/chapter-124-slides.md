---

Slide 1 Question: Is suffering a sign that God has abandoned the righteous?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Many are the afflictions of the righteous; but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.” (Psalm 34:19)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Scripture is honest about reality: righteousness does not guarantee immunity from pain. The promise is not that we will avoid all trouble, but that God provides deliverance through it.

[ILL] Consider a ship in a storm. The anchor does not stop the storm from raging, but it holds the ship steady so it is not lost. God’s presence is that anchor.

Slide 4 Question: How does God view us when we are suffering?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.” (Psalm 103:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a compassionate father embracing a weary child, soft golden light, emotional and tender.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: God’s response to our pain is not cold indifference or judgment. It is paternal compassion. He identifies with our weakness and offers pity.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "pity" here suggests a deep, emotional love and compassion, similar to the word used for a mother's womb (*racham*). It implies a visceral, tender care.

Slide 7 Question: What specific purpose can affliction serve in our spiritual lives?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.” (Psalm 119:71, 67)

Slide 10 Definition: **Statutes**
Refers to God’s specific decrees or laws. The Psalmist implies that prosperity often breeds independence, but difficulty drives us back to the manual of life—God’s Word.

Slide 11 Question: Who did Jesus promise to send to help us in our trials?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “If I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send Him unto you... even the Spirit of truth.” (John 16:7, 15:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove descending with rays of light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit bringing peace.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: Jesus did not leave His followers as orphans. The Holy Spirit serves as the "Comforter," a title that implies one who is called to stand alongside another to help, advocate, and strengthen.

[SN] The Greek word for Comforter is *Parakletos* (Paraclete). In ancient legal and military contexts, this was someone who stood back-to-back with a soldier in battle or pleaded a case for the accused. It is an active, fighting comfort, not just a soothing sentiment.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two ancient soldiers standing back-to-back in defense, symbolizing active support and strength.

Slide 14 Question: What is "pure religion" regarding those who suffer?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a quiet village street, a figure approaching a humble home with a basket of aid.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” (James 1:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer visiting an elderly woman and a child in a humble home, bringing food and comfort.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: True godliness is demonstrated by action. It is not enough to feel pity; one must "visit"—which in Scripture means to look after or care for—those who are vulnerable.

Slide 17 Question: How does God comfort those who mourn the loss of loved ones?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family weeping at a graveside, with a soft light breaking through the clouds above.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Thus saith the Lord: Refrain thy voice from weeping... for thy work shall be rewarded... and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.” (Jeremiah 31:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people looking toward the horizon with hope, tears drying on their faces.

Slide 19 The Blessed Hope: “For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with Him... Wherefore comfort one another with these words.” (1 Thessalonians 4:14-18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting the Resurrection, graves opening and light filling the scene, glorious and triumphant.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: Jeremiah describes death as "the land of the enemy." Death is an intrusion into God's creation. The comfort is that they will "come again" through the resurrection at the Second Coming of Christ.

[SN] Pioneer Perspective: Early Adventists found immense hope in 1 Thessalonians 4. They viewed the "Blessed Hope" (the literal return of Christ) as the only true remedy for death. They comforted one another not with platitudes, but with the promise of the resurrection morning.

Slide 21 Question: Once we are comforted, what is our responsibility?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of one person placing a hand on another's shoulder in a gesture of shared strength.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.” (2 Corinthians 1:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a chain of people passing a lit candle to one another, spreading light in darkness.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: Comfort is a cycle. God comforts us so that we become channels of that same comfort to others. Your experience with pain qualifies you to minister to others in similar pain.

Slide 24 Question: How should we measure our current suffering against our future hope?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a set of weighing scales, one side heavy and low, the other high and light.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.” (2 Corinthians 4:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden crown radiating immense light, contrasting with a small, shadowy burden.

---

Slide 26 Explanation: Paul contrasts "light" vs. "weight" and "moment" vs. "eternal." When placed on the scales of eternity, the heavy trials of today are outweighed by the glory God has prepared.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application:
• **Trust**: God pities you like a Father.
• **Learn**: Ask God what this season teaches about His statutes.
• **Share**: Visit someone else who is hurting.
• **Hope**: Keep your eyes on the eternal weight of glory.
