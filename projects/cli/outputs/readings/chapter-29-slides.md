Study Title: The Importance of Sound Doctrine

---

Slide 1 Question: Is it enough for a person to be sincere in their beliefs, regardless of what those beliefs are?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Sincerity is a virtue, but it is not a substitute for truth. Salvation involves the work of the Holy Spirit combined with a belief in the truth. We must be sincere *about* the truth.

---

Slide 4 Illustration: A traveler may sincerely believe they are on the road home, but if the road leads in the opposite direction, sincerity will not save them. The map (Truth) matters as much as the intent (Sincerity).

Slide 5 Question: How can we know if a religious teaching is true?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of elders gathered around a scroll, discussing and pointing to the text, soft candlelight.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: God does not ask for blind credulity. He asks us to "prove"—or test—every teaching. We are to keep only what aligns with His standard.

---

Slide 8 Term Definition: To **"Prove"** comes from a Greek term used for testing metals to see if they were genuine or counterfeit. We must test every sermon, book, or feeling against the standard of Scripture.

[DYK] In the early church, there was no central human authority to dictate dogma. Believers were expected to search the Scriptures daily to see if what the apostles taught was true (Acts 17:11). The responsibility to verify truth rests on the individual believer.

Slide 9 Question: Upon what foundation must all true doctrine be built?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the construction of a great stone temple, massive stones being set in place.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone.” (Ephesians 2:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large, perfectly square cornerstone supporting the weight of two adjoining stone walls.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Our faith stands on two pillars: the Old Testament (prophets) and the New Testament (apostles), held together by Jesus Christ. Any teaching contradicting these is not on the sure foundation.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two tall marble pillars supporting a grand archway, with light streaming through the center.

---

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: A "cornerstone" was the first stone set in ancient construction. All other stones were aligned to it. If the cornerstone was straight, the building would stand. All doctrine must align perfectly with the character and teachings of Jesus.

---

Slide 13 Question: Why is "doctrine" (teaching) the first priority of Scripture?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wise teacher sitting on a stone bench, instructing disciples with an open scroll.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine...” (2 Timothy 3:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of light descending from heaven onto a scribe's quill as he writes upon parchment.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Before Scripture corrects or instructs us in righteousness, it establishes *doctrine*—the framework of truth. Right living (righteousness) springs from right thinking (doctrine).

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: There is a modern tendency to say, "We don't need doctrine, we just need Jesus." However, without doctrine, we cannot know who Jesus is. Is He a created being? Is He God? Is He a Savior or just a teacher? Doctrine defines the Jesus we worship.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the foundations of a house being laid, symbolizing the framework of truth before the walls are built.

---

Slide 16 Question: Why is it urgent to stick to sound doctrine, especially in the last days?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gathering storm over an ancient city, people looking up with apprehension.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears...” (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd turning away from a humble prophet to listen to a charismatic figure in fine robes gesturing grandly.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The Bible predicts a time when people will reject truth because it is uncomfortable. They will seek teachers who tell them what they *want* to hear ("itching ears") rather than what they *need* to hear.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person covering their ears with their hands while someone reads from a scroll.

---

Slide 19 Term Definition: **"Fables"** (or myths) refer to religious inventions, traditions, or stories that lack the power of the gospel and the authority of Scripture.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of people sitting around a fire at night, listening intently to a storyteller in the shadows.

---

Slide 20 Question: Does God accept worship based on human tradition?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Pharisees performing elaborate hand-washing rituals in a stone courtyard.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing in the temple courts, looking with sadness at tables laden with merchandise and ritual objects.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Worship becomes empty ("in vain") when we elevate human rules, traditions, or cultural preferences above the plain commandments of God.

[ILL] If a doctor prescribes a specific life-saving medicine, but the pharmacist decides to mix in their own homemade ingredients because they taste better, the medicine loses its power. God's Word is the prescription; human tradition is the dilution.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient apothecary mixing herbs in clay jars, with a scroll of instructions ignored on the table.

---

Slide 23 Question: What is the result of abiding in Jesus' true word?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bird being released from a cage, flying into the open sky.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “If ye continue in My word, then are ye My disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31, 32)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prisoner in a dark dungeon watching the heavy door swing open, light flooding in.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: True freedom comes from knowing the truth. Error binds us in confusion, fear, and sin. God’s truth liberates the mind and the conscience.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing on a mountaintop with arms outstretched, looking out over a vast, sunlit landscape.

---

Slide 26 Question: Who will ultimately enter God’s kingdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a distant view of the Holy City, glowing with gold and pearl.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.” (Isaiah 26:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of immense, pearly gates swinging open to welcome a group of robed travelers.

---

Slide 28 Explanation: The gates of the Holy City are opened not just to those who "know" the truth, but to those who "keep" it. Doctrine is meant to be lived.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family walking together on a path towards a bright light, carrying scrolls and helping one another.

Slide 29 Practical Application:
• **Commit** to reading the Bible personally.
• **Evaluate** everything you hear against the Bible.
• **Ask** God for courage to follow truth over tradition.
• **Pray** for the "knowledge of the doctrine" (John 7:17).
