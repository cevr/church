Slide 1 Question: Did the apostles foresee that corruption and error would enter the Christian church from within?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.” (Acts 20:29, 30)

Slide 3 Explanation: The Apostle Paul warned the elders of Ephesus that the greatest danger to the church would not always come from outside persecution, but from internal corruption. He predicted that leaders ("of your own selves") would twist the Scriptures to gain a following.

[DYK] Paul mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 that the "mystery of iniquity" was "already" at work in his day. This suggests that the seeds of apostasy—pride, formalism, and a desire for power—were present even in the apostolic era, waiting for the opportunity to grow.

Slide 4 Question: What specific development must occur before the Second Coming of Christ?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “That day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.” (2 Thessalonians 2:3)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The Bible predicts a major "falling away" (apostasy) involving a specific power called the "man of sin." This power arises not by rejecting religion, but by corrupting it. It involves the adoption of heathen rites and customs into the church to make it more acceptable to the pagan world.

Slide 7 Term Definition: "Falling Away"
From the Greek word *apostasia*, meaning a defection or revolt. It implies standing in the truth and then moving away from it.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Ship and the Sea
A ship is designed to be in the water, but if the water gets into the ship, it sinks.
The church is meant to be in the world to save it, but when the world gets into the church—through worldly customs and politics—the church loses its buoyancy and sinks into error.

Slide 9 Question: How did the character of church leadership change to facilitate this apostasy?

Slide 10 Historical Insight: As the historian Neander notes, “Worldly-minded bishops, instead of caring for the salvation of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to travel about, and entangle themselves in worldly concerns.”

---

Slide 11 Explanation: A shift occurred where spiritual leaders became political players. Instead of feeding the flock of God with Scripture, they sought influence, prestige, and civil power.

[SN] A Spirit-led tangent for study: Compare this "worldly-mindedness" with Jesus’ instruction in John 18:36, "My kingdom is not of this world." The hallmark of the "man of sin" is the attempt to establish the Kingdom of God through the machinery of earthly governments rather than the power of the Holy Spirit.

Slide 12 Question: What defines the union of church and state, and when was its foundation laid?

---

Slide 13 Historical Insight: The union is defined as religious power dominating civil power to further its own ends. The foundation was laid notably during the reign of Constantine (A.D. 313-337).

Slide 14 Explanation: Under Constantine, the government began offering "patronage" to the church. This included immunities, privileges, and financial support. What began as equality with paganism eventually turned into the state enforcing church dogmas and excluding all who disagreed.

[DYK] Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to profess Christianity. While this ended violent persecution, it introduced a new danger: popularity. The church became powerful, wealthy, and politically connected, leading to compromise on biblical truths to maintain state favor.

---

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: This union paved the way for the Papacy to gain control over civil powers. When the church relies on the state for support, it eventually uses the state's sword to punish dissenters. This is the "image" of the beast power warned against in Revelation—forcing conscience through civil law.

Slide 16 Practical Application: Why does this history matter to us today?

• **Guard the Truth**: Ensure beliefs come from the Bible, not custom.
• **Liberty of Conscience**: Value the separation of church and state to protect freedom.
• **Focus on Mission**: Focus on the "salvation of flocks," not political power.
