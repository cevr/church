Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled... For nation shall rise against nation... and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matthew 24:6-8)

Slide 11 Question: Jesus spoke of a "great tribulation." How long was the religious-political power prophesied to persecute the saints?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” (Daniel 7:25)

Slide 13 Explanation: This time period is also described in Revelation 12:6 as "a thousand two hundred and threescore days" (1,260 days).

**Term Definition: Symbolic Prophecy**
In biblical prophecy, a "day" represents a literal "year" (Ezekiel 4:6). Therefore, this period represents 1,260 literal years.

Slide 14 Historical Context: This period aligns with the supremacy of the Papal power in Europe (538 A.D. to 1798 A.D.). The "shortening of the days" (Matt 24:22) refers to the Protestant Reformation, which ended active persecution before the period technically expired.

Slide 15 Question: What celestial signs did Jesus say would occur immediately after that tribulation period?

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven...” (Matthew 24:29)

Slide 17 Historical Fulfillment:

Slide 18 Illustration: Just as road signs tell you a destination is near before you can actually see the city skyline, these historical events serve as markers that we have entered the "time of the end."

Slide 19 Question: How can we know when the Lord is about to appear?

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.” (Matthew 24:32, 33)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a close-up of a fig branch with tender green leaves sprouting, symbolizing new life and the approach of summer.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: We may not know the exact day or hour, but we are commanded to know the *season*. When trees bud, summer is inevitable. When these signs appear, Christ’s coming is inevitable.

Slide 22 Question: What is the danger of thinking Christ will delay His return?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a servant looking out a window, looking bored and distracted, turning away from his duties.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming... The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him... and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.” (Matthew 24:48-51)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master returning unexpectedly to a chaotic household, capturing the moment of surprise.

---

Slide 24 Deeper Insight: The "evil servant" is not an atheist; he calls Him "My lord." The danger is not denying Christ, but losing the sense of urgency and slipping into worldly living.

Slide 25 Practical Application: How do we prepare?
* **Watch:** Pay attention to the signs in the world and the Word.
* **Work:** Engage in the Gospel commission.
* **Wait:** Maintain an attitude of expectancy.
