Slide 1 Question: Has God set a specific time for the judgment of the world?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Because He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in righteousness.” (Acts 17:31)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Judgment is not a random event; it is a scheduled appointment on God’s divine calendar. Just as God appointed a specific time for the first coming of Jesus, He has appointed a specific time for the judgment work prior to the Second Coming.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The concept of an "appointed day" resonated deeply with the ancient audience. In legal systems, a trial cannot proceed without a set date. God is a God of order, not confusion.

Slide 5 Question: How is this judgment announced to the world?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach... Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.” (Revelation 14:6-7)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: This is the "First Angel's Message." It combines the "everlasting gospel" with the urgent announcement that the judgment is no longer a future event, but has arrived.

---

Slide 8 Term Definition: **"Angel"** (Greek: *aggelos*) literally means "messenger." While John saw a literal angel in vision, this symbol represents God's people proclaiming this urgent message to every nation, kindred, and tongue.

Slide 9 Illustration: Imagine a town crier or an emergency broadcast. It interrupts normal life to deliver news affecting everyone's safety. The First Angel's message is God's "loud voice" alerting the world to the time we are living in.

Slide 10 Question: Revelation 14 announces the judgment. Which prophetic book unseals the timing of this event?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel, aged and wise, rolling up a scroll and sealing it with wax, a look of solemn obedience on his face.

---

Slide 12 Progressive Disclosure:
1. Daniel is sealed until the end times.
2. Revelation 10 depicts an angel with a "little book open."
3. This implies the study of Daniel's prophecies would be "opened" or understood just before the judgment message is proclaimed.

---

Slide 13 Speaker Note: **Spirit-Led Insight:** In Revelation 10, the angel swears that "there should be time no longer." This refers to the end of **prophetic time**. The longest time prophecy marks the beginning of the judgment; after this, there are no more date-setting prophecies, only the wait for the Second Coming.

Slide 14 Question: What was the specific time prophecy regarding the judgment and the sanctuary?

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest standing before the veil in the ancient sanctuary, incense smoke rising in the soft light.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The "cleansing of the sanctuary" corresponds to the judgment. In the earthly service, this happened on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). Daniel 8:14 points to the time when Christ, our High Priest, begins this work in the heavenly sanctuary.

Slide 17 Question: How does Scripture describe the experience of the believers who first discovered this time message?

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.” (Revelation 10:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle John in vision, symbolically consuming a small scroll, surrounded by a mystical atmosphere.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: "Eating" the book symbolizes internalizing God's word.
* **Sweet:** The message that Jesus was coming to judge the world and take His people home was incredibly joyful.
* **Bitter:** When the date passed and Jesus did not return, they experienced a "Great Disappointment."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of believers looking up at the night sky with expressions of hope turning to sorrow, historically respectful.

---

Slide 20 Illustration: The disciples experienced a similar bitterness. They thought Jesus would take the throne (sweet), but He went to the cross (bitter). Yet, in that disappointment, God's greatest work of redemption was actually being accomplished.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: The error was not in the *time* calculation, but in the *event*. They thought "cleansing the sanctuary" meant the earth would be purified by fire. Instead, it meant Christ was entering the final phase of His ministry in heaven—the investigative judgment.

Slide 22 Question: Did this disappointment mean the work was finished?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise breaking over a landscape, symbolizing a new day and a new beginning.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “And He said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.” (Revelation 10:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of John receiving a divine command, pointing outward toward a map of the world.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Far from being the end, the disappointment was a new beginning. God commissioned them to "prophesy again," preaching the First, Second, and Third Angels' messages to the entire world.

---

Slide 25 Practical Application:
* **Certainty:** We live in the hour of God's judgment.
* **Resilience:** Like the early believers, we must study deeper when we face misunderstanding, rather than giving up.
* **Hope:** The judgment vindicates God and prepares for the harvest.
