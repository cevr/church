---

Slide 1 Question: How does God treat us regarding our sins?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities... For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.” (Psalm 103:10-11)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Justice gives what is deserved; mercy gives what is needed. God holds back the punishment we naturally deserve. He measures His mercy not by human standards, but by the vast distance between heaven and earth—implying it is limitless.

Slide 4 Did You Know? In the Hebrew text, the word for "mercy" is often *chesed*, implying a steadfast, covenant loyalty. It is not a fleeting emotion, but a committed love that persists despite our failures.

Slide 5 Question: What is the Lord’s attitude toward those who ask for pardon?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.” (Psalm 86:5)

---

Slide 7 Term Definition: “Ready to forgive” implies that God does not need to be persuaded. His posture is already one of forgiveness; He is simply waiting for us to ask so He can legally and relationally grant it.

[ILL] Imagine a father standing at the door with the latch unlocked, waiting for his child to knock. He doesn't need to be convinced to open the door; he is already standing there, ready.

Slide 8 Question: What are the conditions for receiving this forgiveness?

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)

Also: “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts...” (Isaiah 55:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person washing their hands in a basin of water, symbolizing cleansing and renewal.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Confession is the key that unlocks the storehouse of mercy. It is not merely admitting a fact, but agreeing with God that sin is evil. True repentance involves a change in "way" (actions) and "thoughts" (mindset).

---

Slide 11 Speaker Note: The Justice of Forgiveness.

[SN] Note the phrase "faithful and just." We often think forgiveness is an act of grace (which it is), but John calls it an act of *justice*. Because Christ has paid the price for sin, God is *just* in forgiving the penitent. He would be unjust to demand payment twice—once from Jesus and once from you.

Slide 12 Question: How did God demonstrate His love before we ever asked for it?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark, stormy background with a single ray of light illuminating a sacrificial lamb.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ on the cross, viewed from a distance, with a compassionate expression, surrounded by darkness.

---

Slide 14 Deeper Insight: This verse destroys the idea that we must fix ourselves before coming to God. The provision for salvation was made while humanity was at its worst. If He loved us enough to die for us while we were rebels, how much more will He receive us now that we return?

Slide 15 Question: How does God respond when a sinner finally returns home?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dusty road winding through hills, with a small figure walking slowly in the distance.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.” (Luke 15:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elderly father embracing a ragged young man on a dirt road, full of emotion and light.

Slide 17 Progressive Disclosure: The Father's Response
*   **Expectancy:** The Father was watching.
*   **Eagerness:** The Father ran.
*   **Acceptance:** The Father kissed him.
*   **Celebration:** The Father feasted.

Slide 18 Cultural Context: The Shame of Running.

[DYK] In the ancient Near Eastern culture, it was considered undignified for an elderly patriarch to run. He would have to hike up his robes, exposing his legs, which was shameful. The father in the parable risked shame to protect his son from the shame of the village.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focused on the feet and robes of a running man, dust kicking up, conveying urgency and disregard for dignity.

Slide 19 Question: Does God ever forget those who cry out to Him?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a mother gazing lovingly at an infant in her arms.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Can a woman forget her sucking child?... Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.” (Isaiah 49:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a mother nursing a child, soft warm lighting highlighting the bond between them.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: The strongest human bond known is that of a nursing mother to her infant. Yet, even this bond is breakable in a fallen world. God’s memory of His children, however, is permanent and unbreakable.

[SN] Our confidence is not in our memory of God, but in His memory of us. We are "graven upon the palms of His hands" (Isaiah 49:16)—a reference to the scars of the Crucifixion. He cannot look at His hands without remembering who He saved.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application: Since God is "ready to forgive," what holds us back?
*   Pride?
*   Fear that we are too bad?
*   Doubt of His word?

Today, claim the promise: He will not just pardon, He will *abundantly* pardon.
