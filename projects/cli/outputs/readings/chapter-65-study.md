Study Title: Events of the Millennium: The 1,000 Years

Question: What major event marks the beginning of the Millennium?

Biblical Answer: “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17)

Explanation: The Millennium begins with the Second Coming of Christ. This is not a secret or silent event; it is audible ("shout," "trump") and visible. Two groups are saved: the righteous who have died are resurrected (the "first resurrection"), and the righteous living are "caught up" to meet Jesus.

[DYK] The word "Millennium" comes from two Latin words: *mille* (thousand) and *annus* (year). While the word itself is not in the Bible, the specific time period of "a thousand years" is mentioned six times in Revelation chapter 20.

Question: Where do the saints go after meeting Jesus in the air?

Biblical Answer: “In My Father's house are many mansions... I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself.” (John 14:2, 3)

Explanation: Contrary to the idea that peace reigns *on earth* immediately, Jesus takes His people to the "Father's house" (heaven). The saints ascend; they do not stay on the earth during the thousand years.

[ILL] Imagine a groom coming to a distant land to collect his bride. He does not stay in her old, broken-down home; he takes her away to the home he has prepared for her. Jesus, the Bridegroom, takes the church to heaven for the "marriage supper."

Question: What is the condition of the earth while the saints are in heaven?

Biblical Answer: “I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens and they had no light... I beheld, and, lo, there was no man...” (Jeremiah 4:23, 25)

Progressive Disclosure: • The righteous are in heaven • The wicked are destroyed by the brightness of His coming (2 Thess. 2:8) • The earth returns to a chaotic, "void" state similar to before Creation.

Term Definition: “Bottomless Pit” (Revelation 20:1-3) comes from the Greek word *abussos* (abyss). In the Greek translation of Genesis 1:2, this same word describes the earth "without form and void." The "bottomless pit" is not a subterranean cavern, but the dark, chaotic, desolate earth.

Question: What happens to Satan during these 1,000 years?

Biblical Answer: “And He laid hold on the dragon... and bound him a thousand years... and shut him up.” (Revelation 20:2, 3)

Explanation: Satan is bound to this desolate earth. He cannot leave, and because the righteous are in heaven and the wicked are dead, he has no one to tempt.

[ILL] If a master criminal is locked in a prison cell alone, he is effectively "bound" not just by chains, but by circumstance. Even if he wanted to commit a crime, he cannot, because there is no one present to deceive or harm. Satan is forced to wander the ruins of the world he ruined.

[SN] Spirit-led Insight: This period allows the universe to see the true nature of sin. Satan is left with the result of his rebellion—a destroyed planet and silence. Meanwhile, in heaven, the saints participate in judgment (Rev. 20:4), reviewing the records of history to understand God's justice regarding those who were not saved.

Question: What events signal the end of the 1,000 years?

Biblical Answer: “But the rest of the dead [the wicked] lived not again until the thousand years were finished... And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison.” (Revelation 20:5, 7)

Explanation: Three things happen at the close of the Millennium:
1. The Holy City descends (Rev. 21:2).
2. The wicked dead are raised (the "second resurrection").
3. Satan is "loosed" because he now has people to deceive again.

Question: What is the final outcome of the controversy?

Biblical Answer: “And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them... And the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also... Nevertheless we... look for new heavens and a new earth.” (Revelation 20:9; 2 Peter 3:10, 13)

Explanation: Satan deceives the resurrected wicked into attacking the Holy City. God intervenes with fire, which cleanses the earth. This is the "second death." From these ashes, God recreates the world.

[SN] Historical Context: Early Adventist pioneers emphasized that hell is not an eternal torture chamber but a "consuming fire" (Malachi 4:1) that burns up sin "root and branch." Satan (the root) and sinners (the branches) are consumed, leaving a clean universe.

Practical Application: We are currently living in the time of probation, before the 1,000 years begin. We have a choice: to be part of the "first resurrection" regarding life, or to wait for the "second resurrection" regarding death. God's plan is not just to save us, but to vindicate His character and safely remove sin from the universe forever.

Question for Reflection: Since we know the earth will eventually be dissolved, what manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness? (2 Peter 3:11)
