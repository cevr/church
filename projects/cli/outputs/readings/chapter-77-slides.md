Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law and make it honorable.” (Isaiah 42:21)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: To "magnify" usually means to make a small object appear larger. However, in this spiritual context, it means to reveal the true greatness, breadth, and glory of something that has been underestimated.

Slide 4 Word Study: Jesus came not to diminish the law, but to show how broad and spiritual its requirements truly are.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "magnify" here is *gadal*, which means "to make great, powerful, or important." The word for "honorable" implies majesty and glory. Christ came to restore the law to its rightful place of dignity.

Slide 5 Question: Why was it necessary for the Lord to work in this way?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy law.” (Psalm 119:126)

“Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.” (Mark 7:9)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: By the time Jesus arrived, religious leaders had encrusted the Ten Commandments with thousands of man-made rules. These human additions "made void" God's law, turning it into a burden rather than a delight.

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine a beautiful painting covered in layers of dust and mud. The painting hasn't changed, but its beauty is obscured. Human tradition was the mud; Jesus came to wipe it away so the Law could be seen clearly again.

Slide 9 Question: Did Jesus come to abolish or remove the Law?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing firm as a foundation, looking steadfast and unmovable.

---

Slide 11 Term Definition: “Fulfill” (Greek: *pleroo*) means "to fill up," "to make full," or "to bring to realization." It is the opposite of "empty" or "destroy." Jesus filled the law with its true meaning and perfectly lived it out.

Slide 12 Insight: If a builder "fulfills" a contract to build a house, he doesn't dynamite the house when he is done; the house stands as a monument to his work.

[SN] Jesus says not one "jot or tittle" will pass away. The Law stands as a finished, perfect structure because of His work.

Slide 13 Question: How did Jesus specifically "magnify" the law in His teaching?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Sermon on the Mount, with listeners leaning in intently to hear Jesus speak.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill... But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.” (Matthew 5:21-22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting two men: one holding a weapon, the other simply glaring with intense anger, showing the parallel of the heart.

Slide 15 Progressive Disclosure:
**The Letter vs. The Spirit**

*   **Letter:** Do not commit the physical act of murder.
*   **Spirit:** Do not harbor unjust anger or hatred.
*   **Letter:** Do not commit the physical act of adultery.
*   **Spirit:** Do not harbor lust in the heart.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Jesus showed that the commandments are not just about outward actions, but about the condition of the heart. He "magnified" the law by extending its jurisdiction to our thoughts and motives.

Slide 17 Question: If the law is so broad and we are sinful, how can we stand before it?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in humility and repentance, overshadowed by a high standard they cannot reach.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh...” (Romans 8:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus stepping forward to intervene for a fallen person, soft light surrounding Him.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: The law is a diagnostic tool—it reveals sin and declares God’s standard—but it has no power to cure the human heart. Only Christ can provide the remedy.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a physician examining a patient; the physician holds a tool that identifies the illness but looks to the medicine to cure it.

---

Slide 20 Illustration: A thermometer can tell you that you have a fever, but it cannot cure the fever. In the same way, the Law tells us we are sinners, but only the Great Physician can cure the sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus clearly depicted as the Healer, touching the forehead of a sick man.

---

Slide 21 Question: Does the death of Jesus mean the law is now abolished?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the three crosses on Golgotha, silhouetted against a dark, stormy sky.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression.” (Romans 4:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a courtroom scroll or legal decree resting at the foot of the cross.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: If the law could have been abolished, Jesus would not have needed to die. He died to pay the penalty demanded *by* the law. The payment of the debt proves the validity of the debt.

[SN] The cross is the greatest argument for the perpetuity of the Law. If a judge pays a fine for a criminal, he upholds the law while showing mercy. If he tore up the rulebook, no payment would be needed.

Slide 24 Practical Application:

1.  **Respect:** The Law is a transcript of God’s character.
2.  **Internalize:** Ask God to write His law in your heart.
3.  **Gratitude:** Praise Jesus for keeping the law perfectly for us.
