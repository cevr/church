Study Title: The Kingdoms of Grace and Glory

---

Slide 1 Question: What promise did Jesus make to His followers regarding the future?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12:32)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd cradling a lamb, surrounded by a small flock, symbolizing safety and divine care.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus assures His followers that the kingdom is a gift, not something earned. Scripture reveals two phases of this kingdom: the spiritual kingdom now (Grace) and the literal kingdom to come (Glory).

[DYK] The term "little flock" implies that God’s people may often feel outnumbered or marginalized in this world, but they are the central focus of the Father's care.

Slide 4 Question: To which throne do we come right now for help?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” (Hebrews 4:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavenly throne bathed in approachable, golden light, dispensing mercy rather than judgment.

---

Slide 6 Term Definition: **The Kingdom of Grace** is the spiritual reign of God in the hearts of believers now. It was established to save humanity from sin. Accessing this "throne of grace" gives us power to live holy lives before the physical kingdom comes.

[ILL] Imagine a refugee seeking asylum. The "Throne of Grace" is the processing center where citizenship is granted and papers are stamped "Forgiven," preparing the refugee to eventually enter the country (the Kingdom of Glory).

Slide 7 Question: How does one become a subject of this Kingdom of Grace?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person reaching out with empty hands to receive a gift.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.” (Ephesians 2:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ reaching down to lift a fallen person, emphasizing divine assistance over human effort.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: Citizenship is granted through faith in Jesus. In the parable of the wheat and tares (Matt. 13:38), the "children of the kingdom" are those who have accepted this grace, living in the world alongside the "tares."

Slide 10 Question: What happened to the original physical dominion (kingdom) given to humanity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam in the Garden of Eden, standing with dignity among the animals.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And God said, Let us make man in our image... and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth...” (Genesis 1:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the unspoiled creation, with Adam looking out over a lush, vibrant landscape.

---

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: Adam was originally the "king" of the earth under God. When Adam sinned, he forfeited this dominion to Satan. The plan of salvation is the process of buying back (redeeming) both the people and their lost dominion.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider 1 Samuel 8:7. Israel was intended to be a "kingdom of priests" representing God's rule. When they asked for a human king "like the nations," they rejected the direct theocracy of God, leading to earthly thrones that eventually failed.

---

Slide 13 Question: What prophecy describes the history of earthly kingdoms until Christ returns?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Ezekiel standing before a vision of crumbling city walls and overturned pillars.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until He come whose right it is; and I will give it Him.” (Ezekiel 21:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of successive banners and flags of ancient empires (Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome) falling to the ground.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: This prophecy predicts the successive overturning of world empires. The dominion "shall be no more" (no permanent global king) until Jesus, the One "whose right it is," returns.

[DYK] The "diadem" and "crown" mentioned in Ezekiel 21:26 represented the removal of the visible kingship from Zedekiah. Since then, no son of David has sat on a literal earthly throne in Jerusalem. The throne awaits Christ.

---

Slide 16 Question: Where is Jesus now, and what is He doing?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus ascending into the clouds, with disciples watching from below.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.” (Revelation 3:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus seated at the right hand of the Father in a place of immense light and authority.

---

Slide 18 Progressive Disclosure:
1. **Christ is currently on the Father's Throne**: Functioning as High Priest and Mediator.
2. **He is waiting**: Sitting at the right hand "until" His enemies are made His footstool.
3. **He is not yet on "His" Throne**: The throne of His glory is distinct from the Father's throne.

[ILL] A Prince Regent may sit at the right hand of the King to administer affairs of state, but there comes a Coronation Day when the Prince assumes his own specific throne.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a High Priest interceding before a holy altar, with a crown visible in the distance but not yet worn.

---

Slide 19 Question: When will Jesus sit upon the "Throne of His Glory"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the heavens parting, revealing a glorious procession of angels.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory.” (Matthew 25:31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ King seated on a radiant throne, surrounded by myriads of angels, distinct from the previous priestly imagery.

---

Slide 21 Term Definition: **The Kingdom of Glory** is the literal, physical establishment of Christ's rule when He returns. It is the restoration of what was lost in Eden.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the New Jerusalem descending, blending the beauty of a city with the nature of Eden.

---

Slide 22 Question: What is the final reward for those who accepted the Kingdom of Grace?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse multitude of people looking upward with expressions of joy and relief.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matthew 25:34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus gesturing with open arms, welcoming the faithful into a kingdom of light.

---

Slide 24 Deeper Insight: Notice the word "inherit." You cannot buy an inheritance; you are born into it. We are "born again" into the Kingdom of Grace now so that we may "inherit" the Kingdom of Glory then.

---

Slide 25 Practical Application:
*   **Accept Grace**: Approach the throne of grace today for help.
*   **Live as Citizens**: Reflect the laws of the coming kingdom now.
*   **Look with Hope**: Earthly chaos is temporary; the King is coming to restore peace.
