Study Title: The Eternal Gospel: Christ in the Old Testament

Question: What is the universal condition of humanity, and how does God offer the solution?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned... even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.” (Romans 5:12, 18)

Explanation: The Bible presents two representatives for the human race: Adam and Christ. Through Adam’s fall, sin became an inherited condition, leading to death. Through Christ (the "Second Adam"), righteousness is offered as a free gift.

[ILL] Imagine a debt inherited by a family that no member can pay. Then, a benefactor steps in, not only to pay the debt but to credit the family’s account with his own wealth. Adam left us the debt of sin; Christ credits us with His righteousness.

Question: Is the method of salvation different in the Old Testament than in the New?

Biblical Answer: “Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12) ... “The just shall live by his faith.” (Habakkuk 2:4)

Explanation: Salvation has never been earned by works—not for us, and not for the prophets. Whether in the time of Habakkuk or the time of the Apostles, the method is identical: faith in the saving power of God.

[DYK] The verse “The just shall live by faith” appears three times in the New Testament (Romans 1:17, Galatians 3:11, Hebrews 10:38), but it originates from the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk. This demonstrates that the doctrine of righteousness by faith is the foundation of the entire Bible.

Question: Did the Patriarchs, like Abraham, understand the Gospel?

Biblical Answer: “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham... Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and he saw it, and was glad.” (Galatians 3:8; John 8:56)

Explanation: The "Gospel" (Good News) was not an invention of the New Testament era. It was preached to Abraham. When Abraham offered sacrifices, he looked forward in faith to the coming Messiah, just as we look backward in faith to the Cross.

Term Definition: **Justification**: The legal act where God declares a sinner "righteous" not because of their own deeds, but because they have accepted Christ's record. Abraham believed God, and it was "counted" (credited) to him as righteousness.

Question: Did Moses and the Israelites have a relationship with Christ?

Biblical Answer: “By faith Moses... esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt... for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” (Hebrews 11:24-26; 1 Corinthians 10:4)

Explanation: This is a profound truth: The Leader of Israel in the wilderness was Christ Himself. Moses chose to suffer with Christ rather than enjoy the temporal pleasures of Egypt. The "Rock" that provided water in the desert was a type (symbol) of Jesus, who was struck so that the water of life could flow to a thirsty world.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The "Angel of the Lord" who appeared to Moses in the burning bush and led Israel in the pillar of cloud is understood by early Adventist pioneers to be the pre-incarnate Christ. This explains why Moses could suffer the "reproach of Christ"—he knew Him personally.

Question: Who inspired the Old Testament prophets to write?

Biblical Answer: “Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.” (1 Peter 1:11)

Explanation: The Holy Spirit who inspired Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Moses is specifically identified here as "the Spirit of Christ." Therefore, the voice speaking in the Old Testament is the voice of Jesus.

[ILL] A ghostwriter pens a biography, but the ideas come from the subject. In the Bible, while human hands held the pen, the "Spirit of Christ" provided the thoughts, ensuring the message centered on the plan of salvation.

Question: How did Jesus use the Old Testament to teach His disciples?

Biblical Answer: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)

Explanation: On the road to Emmaus, Jesus did not reveal Himself by showing His physical scars immediately. Instead, He revealed Himself through the Word. He showed that the Pentateuch (Moses) and the Prophetic books were all pointing toward His life, death, and resurrection.

Deeper Insight: Jesus affirmed that Moses "wrote of Me" (John 5:46). This validates the typology of the sacrificial system. Every lamb sacrificed, every high priest ordained, and every sanctuary service was a shadow cast by the reality of Jesus Christ.

Practical Application: Since Jesus is the "author and finisher of our faith" (Hebrews 12:2), how should we read the Old Testament today?
• We should look for Jesus in every story and symbol.
• We can claim the promises given to Abraham, for by faith we are his children (Galatians 3:7).
• We can rest assured that the plan of salvation is unchangeable and eternal.
