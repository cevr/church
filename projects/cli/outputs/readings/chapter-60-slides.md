Study Title: The State of the World Before Christ Returns

---

Slide 1 Question: What did Jesus say the moral condition of the world would be just before His return?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “As it was in the days of Noe [Noah], so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus draws a direct parallel between the time of Noah and the end of time. Genesis 6:5 describes Noah’s day as a time when “wickedness… was great” and thoughts were “only evil continually.” It was characterized by a rejection of God and widespread violence.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? In the "days of Noah," humanity possessed great physical strength and intellect, having lived for centuries. Yet, instead of leading to a golden age, their "imaginations" led to corruption. This suggests that human progress does not automatically equate to moral improvement.

Slide 5 Question: Will the world eventually become fully converted and good before the end?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.” (Matthew 13:30)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: In the Parable of the Wheat and Tares, Jesus explains that good (wheat) and evil (tares) will coexist until the very end. The "harvest" is the end of the world. We are not to expect a time when evil is eradicated by human effort prior to His return.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine a garden where weeds have entangled their roots with the flowers. If you pull the weeds too early, you damage the flowers. The Master Gardener waits until the full maturity of the plant to make the final separation. God allows character to fully develop before the final judgment.

Slide 9 Question: If the whole world isn't converted, what is the purpose of preaching the Gospel?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a messenger standing on a hill, holding a scroll, looking out over a vast landscape of diverse nations and cities.

---

Slide 11 Definition: **"For a witness"** implies giving testimony or evidence. The goal of preaching is to give every person a fair opportunity to choose a side, not necessarily to guarantee that every person will accept it.

---

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: This corrects the belief that the world would enter a "temporal millennium" of peace before Jesus returns. The Bible teaches that the Gospel is an invitation, and the end comes when the invitation has been heard worldwide.

[SN] **The Great Controversy perspective:** God values free will above all. The "witness" ensures that God's justice is vindicated because everyone has made an informed decision for or against His government.

Slide 13 Question: What will be the political and social atmosphere in the last days?

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war, stir up the mighty men... Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.” (Joel 3:9, 10)

---

Slide 15 Progressive Disclosure:
• **Perilous Times:** Men will "wax worse and worse" (2 Timothy 3:13).
• **False Security:** Nations will cry "Peace, peace" when there is no peace (Jeremiah 6:14).
• **Suddenness:** Destruction comes when the world feels most secure (1 Thessalonians 5:3).

---

Slide 16 Did You Know? The phrase "beat your plowshares into swords" is the exact reverse of the famous peace prophecy in Micah 4:3. While God’s ultimate Kingdom brings peace, the nations' final act in this present age is a preparation for conflict.

Slide 17 Question: How should the Christian react to this darkening world?

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.” (Luke 21:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a humble family standing outside their home at night, looking up at a break in the clouds where a brilliant heavenly light shines through.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: We are told, "Neither fear ye their fear" (Isaiah 8:12). While the world trembles, the believer sees these events as signposts. The worsening conditions are not a sign that God has lost control, but a sign that He is about to return to restore all things.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Connection:** The early Advent believers saw themselves as "watchmen" on the walls of Zion. They understood that true peace comes not from political treaties, but from the Prince of Peace.

---

Slide 20 Practical Application: How do we live in a "wheat and tares" world?
• **Don't be discouraged:** Evil must grow until the harvest.
• **Be a witness:** Share the light; leave the results to God.
• **Have courage:** Offer the hope of redemption to a fearful world.
• **Look up:** Keep your focus on Jesus, not the crisis.
