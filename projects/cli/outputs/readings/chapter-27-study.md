Study Title: Bible Election: God's Choice and Ours

Question: How long ago did God determine a plan to save humanity?

Biblical Answer: "According as He hath chosen us in Him [Christ] before the foundation of the world." (Ephesians 1:4)

Explanation: Before the earth was formed or sin entered, God had already secured a way for humanity to be saved. This "election" is primarily focused on Christ—He is the Chosen One, and when we are "in Him," we share in that election.

[DYK] The phrase "foundation of the world" (Greek *katabole*) implies the very conception or casting down of the structure of the universe. God’s love for you predates history itself.

Question: Is this salvation automatic, or is there an action required on our part?

Biblical Answer: "Wherefore... brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure." (2 Peter 1:10)

Explanation: While God provides the invitation (the calling), we must provide the diligence. Salvation is a cooperative relationship; God gives the grace, but we must actively choose to accept and walk in it.

[ILL] Imagine a ship that is "elected" or scheduled to cross the ocean safely to a specific destination. The ship's destiny is fixed. However, for you to reach that destination, you must choose to board the ship and remain on board during the journey.

Question: Does God arbitrarily choose some for salvation and others for destruction?

Biblical Answer: "Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." (1 Timothy 2:4)

Explanation: It is God's will that *all* be saved. He does not predestine any individual to be lost. His "predestination" is the pre-determined plan that anyone who accepts Christ will be adopted as a son or daughter (Ephesians 1:5).

Question: How then do we understand the scripture that says God "hardens" whom He will?

Biblical Answer: "With the merciful Thou wilt shew Thyself merciful; with an upright man Thou wilt shew Thyself upright... and with the froward [perverse] Thou wilt shew Thyself froward." (Psalm 18:25, 26)

Explanation: God acts toward men according to their own choices. The same sun that softens wax also hardens clay. The difference is not in the sun, but in the nature of the material. When God's love shines on a rebellious heart that refuses to yield, that heart becomes harder—not because God wants it to, but because the individual resists Him.

Term Definition: "Froward" comes from the Old English "from-ward," meaning turning away or perverse. It describes someone who stubbornly resists guidance.

Question: What is the essential condition for receiving salvation?

Biblical Answer: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." (Acts 16:31). "Choose you this day whom ye will serve." (Joshua 24:15)

Explanation: Belief is not merely an intellectual nod; in Scripture, it implies trust and loyalty. God respects human free will so deeply that He requires us to "choose" and "will" to serve Him (John 7:17).

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The concept of "whosoever will" (Revelation 22:17) is the closing invitation of the Bible. It stands in contrast to the idea of limited atonement. The Pioneers of the Advent movement strongly emphasized that the atonement was provided for all, though applied only to those who believe.

Question: Is it possible to have your name written in heaven and then removed?

Biblical Answer: "He that overcometh,... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life." (Revelation 3:5)

Explanation: Having one's name written in heaven (Luke 10:20) is a cause for rejoicing, but it is conditional on perseverance. We are told to "hold fast" (Revelation 3:11) and "endure unto the end" (Matthew 24:13). A name is retained in the Book of Life through a continuous, living connection with Jesus.

Deeper Insight: This touches on the concept of the Investigative Judgment. A name can be entered into the book when a person turns to God, but the final sealing of that name depends on a life of faithful overcoming through the power of Christ.

[ILL] A runner who signs up for a marathon is "registered" (written in the book). But to receive the medal (the crown), they must not only start the race but finish it.

Practical Application: Since God has done His part by choosing us "before the foundation of the world," our focus today should be on our part:
1.  **Choose**: Make a daily decision to serve God ("Choose you this day").
2.  **Endure**: Don't let go when life gets hard ("Hold that fast which thou hast").
3.  **Trust**: Know that if you love God, He is working everything for your good (Romans 8:28).
