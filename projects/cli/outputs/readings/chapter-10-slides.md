Slide 3 Explanation: God does not hold grudges. While He notices transgression, His disposition is not one of eagerness to punish, but of joy in showing mercy. He finds pleasure in forgiving.

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “...for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matthew 5:45)

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God...” (1 John 3:1)

Slide 20 Illustration: A mirror has no light of its own; it can only shine if it reflects the sun. Likewise, we cannot manufacture divine love; we can only reflect the love God has first shone upon us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a polished bronze mirror resting on a window sill, catching and reflecting the bright sunlight.

---

Slide 21 Question: Does God’s love ever include discipline?

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.” (Revelation 3:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a serious but kind teacher instructing a student, correcting a mistake on a scroll.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of water being poured from a pitcher over hands, symbolizing washing and regeneration.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in humility, empty-handed, receiving a blessing from above.

---

Slide 28 Question: Can anything separate the believer from this love?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing on a solid rock in the midst of a turbulent sea, appearing secure and calm.

---

Slide 29 Biblical Answer: “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life... nor things present, nor things to come... shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a strong, golden chain that is unbroken, glowing with a supernatural light.

• Extend mercy to others.
• Rest in the assurance of adoption.
