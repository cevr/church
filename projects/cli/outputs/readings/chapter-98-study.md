Study Title: God, Government, and Conscience

Question: What is the source of civil authority, and how should a Christian relate to it?

Biblical Answer: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.” (Romans 13:1)

Explanation: The Bible teaches that God is the Sovereign of the universe, and He permits earthly governments to exist to maintain order. Anarchy is contrary to God’s character. Therefore, Christians are called to be exemplary citizens, respecting the office of civil rulers and abiding by the laws of the land.

[DYK] In Romans 13, the ruler is called a "minister of God." The Greek word used is *diakonos* (servant). Even secular leaders serve a divine purpose by curbing evil and protecting society from chaos.

Question: Did Jesus distinguish between our duty to the government and our duty to God?

Biblical Answer: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.” (Matthew 22:21)

Explanation: Christ established a clear boundary between two distinct spheres: the civil (Caesar) and the spiritual (God). We owe the government taxes ("tribute"), honor, and compliance in civil matters. However, we owe God our worship, our supreme love, and our conscience. The state has no jurisdiction over the soul.

[ILL] Imagine two distinct mailboxes. You place your tax returns in the government's box; it belongs to them. But your prayers, your worship, and the loyalty of your heart belong in God's box. To give Caesar what belongs to God is idolatry; to deny Caesar what is his (in civil matters) is rebellion.

Question: What must a believer do if the civil government passes a law that contradicts the Law of God?

Biblical Answer: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29)

Explanation: When the "higher powers" of earth conflict with the "Highest Power" of heaven, the Christian’s loyalty must remain with God. In the text provided, the apostles were forbidden to preach in Jesus' name. Because this human command contradicted Christ’s divine commission, they respectfully but firmly disobeyed the human order to obey the divine one.

Term Definition: "Conscience" is the internal sense of what is right or wrong in one's conduct or motives, impelling one toward right action. For the Christian, this is bound by the Word of God.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The history of God's people is filled with this tension. In Daniel 3, the issue was *forced worship* (bowing to the image). In Daniel 6, the issue was *forbidden worship* (prayer restricted). In both cases, the faithful believers remained loyal citizens in all civil matters but refused to compromise in religious matters, proving that the state cannot legislate worship.

Question: Why is it dangerous for any human power to insert itself between a soul and God?

Biblical Answer: “So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God.” (Romans 14:12)

Explanation: Judgment is personal. No king, governor, or magistrate can answer for your soul in the final judgment; therefore, no king, governor, or magistrate has the right to dictate your faith. Since we are individually accountable to God, we must be individually free to follow His Word.

Deeper Insight: The text quotes Ecclesiastes 5:8, reminding us that “He that is higher than the highest regardeth.” While earthly rulers are "higher powers" relative to citizens, God is the Supreme Ruler over them. When the state oversteps its bounds into the realm of religion, it usurps the throne of God.

Progressive Disclosure: • God establishes order • Two spheres exist (Civil vs. Religious) • Civil duty includes taxes and respect • Religious duty is to God alone • Conflict requires obeying God first • Final accountability is individual

Practical Application: How do we live this out today?
• **Be Good Citizens:** Pay taxes, obey traffic laws, and improve the community.
• **Honor Authorities:** Treat leaders with respect, even when disagreeing.
• **Guard the Conscience:** If a requirement forces you to break God's Ten Commandments, respectfully decline.
• **Trust God:** Like Daniel and the apostles, trust that God can deliver those who stand firm for Him.
