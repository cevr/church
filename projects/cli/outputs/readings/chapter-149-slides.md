---

Slide 1 Question: Who is the true owner of the world's wealth and resources?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.” (Haggai 2:8); “For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.” (Psalm 50:10)

Slide 3 Explanation: While humans possess property, the Bible teaches that God retains ultimate ownership as the Creator. We are not owners in the absolute sense, but stewards—managers entrusted with goods that belong to another.

Slide 4 Illustration: Consider a cashier. Thousands of dollars pass through their hands, yet they own none of it. They handle it strictly according to the owner's instructions. Similarly, we manage resources that God has placed in our hands.

Slide 5 Question: What are the spiritual dangers of forgetting God’s ownership and focusing on accumulating wealth?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.” (1 Timothy 6:9)

---

Slide 7 Term Definition: “Snare” refers to a trap used to catch animals. The text suggests that the pursuit of wealth for its own sake is a trap that entangles the soul, leading to spiritual ruin.

[DYK] In the ancient world, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor, yet Jesus and the apostles frequently warned that it could become a barrier to faith if it replaced trust in the "living God."

Slide 8 Question: How does God instruct us to acknowledge His ownership and honor Him?

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase.” (Proverbs 3:9); “And all the tithe of the land... is the Lord's: it is holy unto the Lord.” (Leviticus 27:30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a harvest scene, where the first bundles of wheat are being set aside with care and reverence.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: To "honor" God means to give Him the primary place. The "tithe" is a specific portion—one tenth—of our income. The Bible calls this portion "holy," meaning it is set apart specifically for God's use, not our own.

Slide 11 Question: Was the system of tithing only for the Old Testament Jews, or does it extend to the Christian dispensation?

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.” (1 Corinthians 9:14); “These ought ye to have done [paid tithe], and not to leave the other undone.” (Matthew 23:23)

---

Slide 13 Historical Context:
*   **Ancient Origin:** Tithing predates the law of Moses; Abraham paid tithe to Melchizedek (Hebrews 7:1-2).
*   **Old Testament Method:** The Levites (ministers) were supported by the tithe (Numbers 18:21).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham offering a tenth of his spoils to the priest-king Melchizedek.

---

Slide 14 New Testament Application:
*   **NT Application:** Paul argues that "even so" (in the same manner as the Levites), gospel workers are to be supported.
*   **Christ’s Approval:** Jesus validated the practice of tithing while emphasizing the need for justice and mercy.

---

Slide 15 Insight [SN]: The book of Hebrews connects tithing to the priesthood of Melchizedek. Abraham paid tithe to Melchizedek. Christ is our High Priest "after the order of Melchizedek." If we are Abraham's spiritual children, we support the ministry of Christ on earth through the tithe.

Slide 16 Question: What does God promise to those who faithfully return the tithe to His "storehouse"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large stone storehouse with heavy wooden doors, suggesting abundance and security.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse... and prove me now herewith... if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.” (Malachi 3:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of light streaming down from the clouds onto a village, representing the "windows of heaven."

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: God issues a challenge to "prove" (test) Him. The "storehouse" implies a centralized treasury where means are gathered to support the organized work of God, ensuring sustenance for the ministry.

[ILL] Imagine a garden hose. As long as it allows water to flow through, it stays wet and useful. If we allow God’s blessings to flow through us, He ensures we are sustained. Blocking the flow cuts us off from the source.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stream of water flowing freely into a garden, keeping the plants lush and green.

---

Slide 19 Practical Application:
*   **Recognition:** We acknowledge God provides the "power to get wealth."
*   **Regularity:** We set aside the tithe first, before other expenses.

---

Slide 20 Practical Application:
*   **Support:** This system is God's method to spread the Gospel worldwide.
*   **Trust:** We trust that 90% with God’s blessing goes further than 100% without it.
