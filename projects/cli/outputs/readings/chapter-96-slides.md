Slide 3 Explanation: God is the Creator of all humanity, not merely the tribal deity of one nation. Consequently, His moral government and His offer of salvation extend to every person on earth.

[DYK] The word "Gentile" in Scripture simply translates to "nations" (Hebrew *goyim*, Greek *ethnos*). It refers to anyone outside the specific covenant lineage of Abraham. The gospel message is that through Christ, the "middle wall of partition" is broken down.

Slide 6 Explanation: Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath, declares its origin. He does not say "The Sabbath was made for the Jew," but for "man" (mankind). The Sabbath was instituted at Creation, more than two thousand years before the Jewish nation existed.

[ILL] Consider the air we breathe or the sun that warms us. These were created for "man"—for all humanity. We would never say the sun is "Jewish." In the same way, the Sabbath is a universal blessing for the human race.

Slide 9 Definitions & Insights: 
*   **“Polluting it”:** Treating holy time as common time.
*   **Insight:** The stranger joins the Lord *first* (relationship), then keeps the Sabbath (obedience).

[SN] The "Mixed Multitude" and the Law: When Israel left Egypt, a "mixed multitude" (Exodus 12:38) went with them. God’s instruction was clear: "One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you." God has always had one standard of righteousness for all people.

Slide 15 Explanation: Even in the Gentile city of Corinth, Paul used the Sabbath for religious instruction. There is no record in the New Testament of the apostles instructing Gentiles to keep a different day.

[DYK] The book of Acts covers a period of roughly 30 years after the resurrection of Christ. Throughout this history, the seventh-day Sabbath remains the consistent day of worship for the apostles and their mixed congregations.

Slide 18 Explanation: The Sabbath is not a temporary institution. It began in Eden before sin entered, and continues in the New Earth after sin is destroyed. "All flesh" will unite in worship on God's holy day.
