---

Slide 1 Question: In what condition was man created compared to the angels?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “What is man, that thou art mindful of him? ...Thou madest him a little lower than the angels.” (Hebrews 2:6, 7)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Humanity was created distinct from the angelic host. Angels are "spirits" (Heb. 1:7) with an undying nature. Man was created "lower," meaning he does not possess this undying nature by default.

[DYK] In the hierarchy of creation, man is unique—formed of the dust yet crowned with glory and honor, placed as the ruler of the earth, yet physically distinct from the celestial beings.

Slide 4 Question: How was man formed, and what makes him a "living soul"?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Creator gently breathing into the nostrils of Adam, who is rising from the dust.

Slide 6 Term Definition: **Living Soul**

The union of two elements:
1.  **Body** (Dust)
2.  **Spirit** (Breath of Life)

Note: The text does not say man *was given* a soul, but that he *became* a soul.

Slide 7 Illustration: The Box Metaphor

[ILL] Consider a wooden box made of boards and nails. If you pull the nails out and separate the boards, where is the box? It is gone. It only exists when the parts are united. Similarly, man is a soul only when the dust and the breath of life are united.

Slide 8 Question: Is the term "living soul" applied only to humans?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea... and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a turbulent sea with marine life visible beneath the waves.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: The Bible applies the term "living soul" (or creature) to animals as well. Both man and beast possess the "breath of life" (Genesis 7:21-22). Regarding physical composition, "a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast" (Ecclesiastes 3:19).

Slide 11 Question: Is man naturally immortal (unable to die)?

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Shall mortal man be more just than God?” (Job 4:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Job sitting in ashes, looking contemplative and humble.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: Scripture defines man as "mortal," meaning "subject to death." We are not created with an inherent, indefeasible life source within ourselves.

[SN] **Linguistics:** The word "immortal" is never applied to the soul of man in the KJV Bible. It is a quality that belongs strictly to the Divine nature until it is bestowed upon the faithful.

Slide 14 Question: Who is the only One who possesses immortality by nature?

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords: who only hath immortality.” (1 Timothy 6:15, 16)

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Only God is the source of unborrowed, underived life. Man’s life is a loan from God.

Slide 17 Question: What happens to the "spirit" when a person dies?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunset over a quiet valley, shadows lengthening.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 12:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a light ascending upward to the heavens while dust remains on the ground.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Death is creation in reverse. The dust returns to the ground. The "spirit"—defined as the "breath of life"—returns to God. This spirit is the power of life, not a conscious entity capable of thinking apart from the body.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a candle being blown out, the smoke drifting upward.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: Because the "spirit" (power of life) returns to God, the person ceases to be a "living soul" until the resurrection. Without the union of breath and body, the individual is unconscious in death.

Slide 21 Question: If we are mortal, how do we obtain immortality?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pilgrim walking on a narrow path, reaching toward a distant city of light.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life.” (Romans 2:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure kneeling in prayer, seeking something from above.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: We do not seek for something we already have. We must seek immortality through the Gospel. It has been "brought to light" through Jesus Christ (2 Timothy 1:10).

Slide 24 Question: When will the faithful actually receive this immortality?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic sky with clouds parting and a trumpet visible.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump... and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For... this mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Corinthians 15:52, 53)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a resurrection scene, figures rising in glory with a look of transformation.

---

Slide 26 The Path to Immortality:
1.  **Current State**: We are natural, mortal beings (living souls).
2.  **The Requirement**: We must have the Son to have life (1 John 5:12).
3.  **The Event**: The Resurrection (the last trumpet).
4.  **The Result**: We put on immortality and death is swallowed up in victory.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application: Since we do not have life in ourselves, our entire hope rests in Christ. Our life is currently "hid with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3). We can face mortality with courage, knowing that the Giver of Life will restore us when He appears.
