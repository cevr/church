---

Slide 1 Question: How does Jesus warn us against the desire to accumulate possessions?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus issues a double warning: "Take heed" (pay attention) and "beware" (guard against). He clarifies a fundamental truth: the value of a human life is not measured by net worth or inventory.

---

Slide 4 Definition: “Covetousness” means being inordinately desirous or excessively eager to obtain and possess. It is a hunger that is never satisfied.

Slide 5 Did You Know?

[DYK] The Greek word for covetousness often used in the New Testament is *pleonexia*, which literally means "a desire to have more." It suggests a self-seeking spirit that grabs for itself regardless of others or God's will.

Slide 6 Question: How does God view the person who focuses solely on hoarding wealth for this life?

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:20-21)

---

Slide 8 Explanation: In the parable of the rich man who built bigger barns, God calls him a "fool"—not because he was wealthy, but because he left God out of his calculations. He prepared for a future he wouldn't see and neglected the eternity he was about to enter.

Slide 9 Illustration: The Traveler

[ILL] Imagine a traveler spending all their money decorating a hotel room where they will only stay for one night, while saving nothing for the permanent home they are traveling to. This is the folly of living only for earthly treasure.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a traveler resting briefly at a wayside inn, holding a staff, looking toward a distant city on a hill bathed in golden light.

---

Slide 10 Question: Why does the Apostle Paul equate covetousness with idolatry?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth... and covetousness, which is idolatry.” (Colossians 3:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man turning away from a table of gold to look toward a light from heaven, symbolizing the rejection of idols.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Idolatry is worshiping something created rather than the Creator. When we crave wealth or possessions so much that they consume our thoughts, drive our decisions, and provide our sense of security, those things have taken the place of God on the throne of our hearts.

Slide 13 Spirit-Led Insight

[SN] The Tenth Commandment ("Thou shalt not covet") is unique because it forbids an internal thought process rather than just an external action. It is the root from which other sins spring. For example, Judas’s covetousness led to betrayal (Mark 14:10-11), and David’s covetousness led to adultery and murder.

Slide 14 Question: What are the dangers of striving to be rich?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dangerous path with a hidden snare or trap set upon the ground, soft light revealing the danger.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.” (1 Timothy 6:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man entangled in vines and thorns while reaching for a bag of coins, symbolizing a snare.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The text describes the desire for riches as a "snare" (a trap). It is not the possession of money that destroys, but the resolve ("they that *will* be rich") to pursue it. This pursuit drowns the spiritual life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a ship being weighed down and sinking in rough waters due to an overloaded cargo, symbolizing drowning in destruction.

Slide 17 Deeper Insight

Deeper Insight: The source text highlights that in the "last days," covetousness will be a prevailing sin (2 Timothy 3:1-2). James 5:3 warns that hoarded gold and silver will be "cankered" and stand as a witness against the selfish during the final judgment.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of old gold and silver coins that are rusted and tarnished, lying in a heap, soft somber lighting.

---

Slide 18 Question: Since God owns all the gold and silver (Haggai 2:8), how should we view our possessions?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a majestic hand reaching from the clouds holding the world, symbolizing divine ownership, soft golden light.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Charge them that are rich in this world... that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.” (1 Timothy 6:17-18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wealthy figure kindly handing bread and coins to a group of poor travelers, historically respectful.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: We are called to be stewards, not owners. A steward manages the master's resources for the master's purposes. The antidote to greed is generosity ("ready to distribute").

Slide 21 Illustration: The Flowing Pipe

[ILL] A water pipe remains clean and functional only as long as water flows *through* it. If you block the outlet, the water becomes stagnant. Likewise, God’s blessings are meant to flow through us to others.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient stone aqueduct with clear water flowing freely through it, bathed in sunlight.

---

Slide 22 Question: What is the defining characteristic of the people Christ gathers when He returns?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ descending from the clouds with angels, gathering a multitude of people, soft glorious light.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.” (Psalm 50:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient stone altar with a sacrifice upon it, smoke rising straight up to heaven, historically respectful.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: While the covetous man gathers treasure for himself, Christ gathers a people who have a spirit of sacrifice. Because Jesus gave all to redeem us, His true children share His sacrificial nature, using their resources to bless others and advance God’s work.

Slide 25 Practical Application

How can we guard against covetousness this week?
• Review our spending: Does it reflect love for self or love for God?
• Practice giving: "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).
• Check our security: Are we trusting in a bank account or in the Living God?
