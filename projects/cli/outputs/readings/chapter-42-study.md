Study Title: The Kingdoms of Grace and Glory

Question: What promise did Jesus make to His followers regarding the future?

Biblical Answer: “Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.” (Luke 12:32)

Explanation: Jesus assures His followers that the kingdom is a gift, not something earned. However, Scripture reveals that God’s kingdom operates in two phases: the spiritual kingdom now (Grace) and the literal kingdom to come (Glory).

[DYK] The term "little flock" implies that God’s people may often feel outnumbered or marginalized in this world, but they are the central focus of the Father's care.

Question: To which throne do we come right now for help?

Biblical Answer: “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” (Hebrews 4:16)

Term Definition: **The Kingdom of Grace** is the spiritual reign of God in the hearts of believers now. It was established to save humanity from sin. Accessing this "throne of grace" allows us to receive pardon and power to live holy lives before the physical kingdom comes.

[ILL] Imagine a refugee seeking asylum. The "Throne of Grace" is the processing center where citizenship is granted and papers are stamped "Forgiven," preparing the refugee to eventually enter the country (the Kingdom of Glory).

Question: How does one become a subject of this Kingdom of Grace?

Biblical Answer: “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God.” (Ephesians 2:8)

Explanation: Citizenship is granted through faith in Jesus. In the parable of the wheat and tares (Matt. 13:38), the "children of the kingdom" are those who have accepted this grace, while they still live in the world alongside the "tares."

Question: What happened to the original physical dominion (kingdom) given to humanity?

Biblical Answer: “And God said, Let us make man in our image... and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth...” (Genesis 1:26)

Deeper Insight: Adam was originally the "king" of the earth under God. When Adam sinned, he forfeited this dominion to Satan (the "usurper"). The plan of salvation is the process of buying back (redeeming) both the people and their lost dominion.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the tragedy of 1 Samuel 8:7. Israel was intended to be a "kingdom of priests" (Exodus 19:6) representing God's rule. When they asked for a human king "like the nations," they rejected the direct theocracy of God. This led to a succession of earthly thrones that eventually failed.

Question: What prophecy describes the history of earthly kingdoms until Christ returns?

Biblical Answer: “I will overturn, overturn, overturn it; and it shall be no more, until He come whose right it is; and I will give it Him.” (Ezekiel 21:27)

Explanation: This prophecy predicts the successive overturning of world empires—Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome. The dominion "shall be no more" (no permanent global king) until Jesus, the One "whose right it is," returns.

[DYK] The "diadem" and "crown" mentioned in Ezekiel 21:26 represented the removal of the visible kingship from Zedekiah (the last king of Judah). Since then, no son of David has sat on a literal earthly throne in Jerusalem. The throne awaits Christ.

Question: Where is Jesus now, and what is He doing?

Biblical Answer: “To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.” (Revelation 3:21)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Christ is currently on the Father's Throne**: He is functioning as High Priest and Mediator (Hebrews 10:12-13).
2.  **He is waiting**: He sits at the right hand "until" His enemies are made His footstool (Psalm 110:1).
3.  **He is not yet on "His" Throne**: The throne of His glory is distinct from the Father's throne in heaven.

[ILL] A Prince Regent may sit at the right hand of the King to administer affairs of state (mediation), but there comes a Coronation Day when the Prince assumes his own specific throne and territory.

Question: When will Jesus sit upon the "Throne of His Glory"?

Biblical Answer: “When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory.” (Matthew 25:31)

Term Definition: **The Kingdom of Glory** is the literal, physical establishment of Christ's rule when He returns. It is the restoration of what was lost in Eden.

Question: What is the final reward for those who accepted the Kingdom of Grace?

Biblical Answer: “Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” (Matthew 25:34)

Deeper Insight: Notice the word "inherit." You cannot buy an inheritance; you are born into it. We are "born again" into the Kingdom of Grace now so that we may "inherit" the Kingdom of Glory then.

Practical Application:
*   **Accept Grace**: Have you approached the throne of grace today to find help for your battles?
*   **Live as Citizens**: Do your actions reflect the laws of the coming kingdom?
*   **Look with Hope**: The chaos of earthly governments (the "overturning") is temporary. The King is coming to restore peace.
