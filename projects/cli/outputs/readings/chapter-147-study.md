Study Title: God’s Heart for the Poor

Question: Is God indifferent to the condition of the poor?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord heareth the poor.” (Psalm 69:33)

Explanation: God is not distant from suffering. Throughout Scripture, He portrays Himself as the defender of those who cannot defend themselves. Jesus confirmed this mission when He announced, “He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor” (Luke 4:18).

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, gods were often associated with the wealthy and powerful kings. The God of Israel was unique because He specifically identified Himself as the protector of widows, orphans, and the destitute.

Question: How does God view our acts of kindness toward the needy?

Biblical Answer: “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord: and that which he hath given will He pay him again.” (Proverbs 19:17)

Explanation: This is a profound financial metaphor. When you give to the poor, God views it not as a loss to you, but as a loan to Him—a loan He promises to repay. God guarantees the debt of the poor.

[ILL] Imagine a friend asks to borrow money, but a billionaire stands behind them and signs the promissory note, guaranteeing repayment. You would have no fear of lending. In this text, the Owner of the universe co-signs for the poor.

Question: What is the definition of "pure religion" in the New Testament?

Biblical Answer: “Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” (James 1:27)

Explanation: True religion is not merely holding correct doctrines or attending services; it is active compassion. The text pairs social action (visiting the afflicted) with personal holiness (keeping unspotted).

Term Definition: “To visit” (Greek *episkeptomai*) implies more than a social call. It means to look after, to care for, or to inspect with the intent of helping. It is the same root word used for "bishop" or "overseer."

Question: What special promises are given to those who help the poor?

Biblical Answer: “Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the time of trouble... The Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.” (Psalm 41:1-3)

Explanation: There is a reciprocal relationship in God's economy. Those who show mercy receive mercy. The promise extends to times of personal crisis and sickness, assuring the giver of God’s sustaining power.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Hebrew word for "considereth" in Psalm 41 implies intelligent regard. It suggests studying the needs of the poor to help them wisely, rather than just tossing money carelessly. This mirrors Job's testimony: "the cause which I knew not I searched out" (Job 29:16). It calls for proactive, thoughtful benevolence.

Question: What acts constitute the "fast" that God has chosen?

Biblical Answer: “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? ...Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him...” (Isaiah 58:6-7)

Progressive Disclosure: • Unselfishness • Sharing resources • Hospitality • Clothing the needy

Deeper Insight: Isaiah 58 contrasts empty religious rituals (fasting from food while oppressing others) with true godliness. When God’s people do this work, the text promises that their "light shall rise in obscurity" (Isa 58:10). This suggests that spiritual darkness is often cured by active service to others.

Question: ultimately, who are we serving when we help those in need?

Biblical Answer: “And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.” (Matthew 25:40)

Explanation: Jesus identifies so closely with the suffering that He takes our treatment of them personally. To neglect a poor saint is to neglect the Savior; to feed them is to feed Christ.

[SN] Historical Context: Early Adventists viewed Isaiah 58 as a "blueprint" for Medical Missionary work. They believed that the "repairer of the breach" (Isa 58:12) does not just restore the Sabbath commandment, but also restores the practice of self-sacrificing love for humanity.

Practical Application: How can we "search out" the cause of the poor this week? • Identify a neighbor in need • Donate to a food bank • Visit a nursing home • Listen to someone who feels invisible • Ask God to open our eyes to the needs around us.
