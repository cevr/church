Slide 1 Title Slide: Shadows to Substance

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient altar in the foreground with a soft, glowing cross visible in the distance, symbolizing the transition from shadow to reality.

---

Slide 2 Question: How were God's people expected to live before Christ came, as seen in the lives of Zacharias and Elizabeth?

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.” (Luke 1:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Zacharias serving at the altar of incense, surrounded by the golden glow of the temple interior.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: This verse highlights two distinct aspects of a righteous life:
1.  The **Commandments** (God's moral law).
2.  The **Ordinances** (The ceremonial religious services).
Zacharias and Elizabeth were faithful in both.

---

Slide 5 Term Definition: "Ordinances" in this context refers to the ceremonial laws, including the temple services, sacrifices, and feast days.

Slide 6 Question: What was the purpose of the ceremonial ordinances involving sacrifices and offerings?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large altar with smoke rising, viewed from a distance, conveying a sense of mystery and anticipation.

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.” (Hebrews 10:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lamb casting a shadow on the ground, but the shadow takes the shape of a man on a cross.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: The ceremonial system was a "shadow." A shadow is not the reality; it merely outlines the shape of the reality. These sacrifices pointed forward to the coming Messiah but could not themselves solve the problem of sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dimly lit ancient scroll room, with light filtering in to reveal dust motes, symbolizing the partial revelation of the old system.

---

Slide 9 Illustration: Imagine seeing the shadow of a person coming around a corner. The shadow tells you someone is coming, but you cannot shake hands with the shadow. You must wait for the person (the substance) to arrive. The sacrifices were the shadow; Jesus is the Person.

---

Slide 10 Did You Know?

[DYK] In the Levitical system, if a common person sinned, they had to bring a female goat without blemish (Leviticus 4:27-28). This was a costly and bloody object lesson intended to show the terrible price of sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a humble israelite family sadly parting with a pristine white goat, soft emotional lighting.

---

Slide 11 Question: Since animal sacrifices cannot take away sin, what was the solution?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark sky breaking apart to reveal a beam of heavenly light, symbolizing divine intervention.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. ... Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared Me.” (Hebrews 10:4-5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the nativity scene, focusing on the infant Jesus, emphasizing the "body prepared" for Him.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The repetitive nature of animal sacrifices proved their inability to cleanse the conscience. They were temporary markers until God "prepared a body" for Jesus. Christ became the true sacrifice that the animals only typified.

Slide 14 Question: Under the New Covenant, what happens to the Ten Commandments?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses holding the stone tablets, looking forward into the distance, soft atmospheric perspective.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.” (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:8-10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man in prayer, a soft light emanating from his chest, symbolizing the law written on the heart.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The New Covenant does not abolish the Law; it relocates it. Instead of being written only on tables of stone, the Holy Spirit writes God's principles of love and duty directly into our minds and affections.

---

Slide 17 Insight: Spirit-led Balance

[SN] Note the beautiful balance here. Repentance is toward God (whose Law was broken), and faith is toward our Lord Jesus Christ (who paid the penalty). This preserves the integrity of the Law while exalting the grace of the Gospel.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a balance scale, one side holding a scroll of the law, the other a cross, perfectly balanced in golden light.

Slide 18 Question: How do we publicly commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a quiet river bank at sunrise and a table set with bread and wine, combining the two settings.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer:
**For the Resurrection:** “Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God...” (Colossians 2:12)

**For His Death:** “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come.” (1 Corinthians 11:26)

---

Slide 20 Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Baptism**: A one-time event signifying our death to the old life and rising to a new life.
2.  **The Lord's Supper**: A repeated ordinance to keep the memory of His sacrifice fresh in our minds.

---

Slide 21 Did You Know?

[DYK] The word "baptize" comes from the Greek *baptizo*, meaning to immerse or dip under. This is why the Bible uses the imagery of being "buried" (going under) and "risen" (coming up).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure submerged under clear water, light refracting through the surface, peaceful and symbolic.

Slide 22 Question: What do the symbols of the Lord's Supper represent?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a chalice and a broken loaf of bread on a wooden table, dramatic chiaroscuro lighting.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer:
**The Bread:** “Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you...” (1 Corinthians 11:24)
**The Cup:** “This cup is the new testament in My blood...” (1 Corinthians 11:25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting close up of hands breaking a loaf of bread, historically respectful.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: The bread represents Christ's body, broken to make us whole. The cup represents the New Covenant ratified by His blood. We partake to bring to memory what He accomplished on the cross.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Last Supper, focusing on Jesus holding the cup, soft candlelight illuminating the disciples.

---

Slide 25 Term Definition: Remembrance

"Remembrance" implies more than just mental recall; it is an active memorial, a time to realign our lives with the reality of His sacrifice.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in deep reflection and prayer, historical setting.

---

Slide 26 Question: What attitude should we have when participating in this service?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a congregation in an early church house setting, heads bowed in reverence.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.” (1 Corinthians 11:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man examining his own hands in a beam of light, symbolizing self-examination.

---

Slide 28 Explanation: To partake "unworthily" means to treat the service as a common meal or to participate without a repentant heart. It requires self-examination. We must ensure we are not holding onto known sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple meal table contrasted with a sacred altar, highlighting the difference between common and holy.

---

Slide 29 Insight: Tangent on Worship

[SN] After instituting this solemn service, Jesus and His disciples "sung a hymn" before going to the Mount of Olives (Matthew 26:30). This suggests that despite the sorrow of the cross, the Communion service is ultimately an act of worship and praise.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus and the disciples standing together singing, illuminated by moonlight, peaceful despite the coming storm.

---

Slide 30 Practical Application

*   **Internal Law**: Ask God to write His law of love in your heart today.
*   **Remembrance**: Visualize the service as "looking back" to the Cross and "looking forward" to His coming.
*   **Preparation**: Repent and make things right with God and others before partaking.
