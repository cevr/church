---

Slide 3 Explanation: The prophecy identifies a power often symbolized as a "little horn." This entity is not merely political but religious, as it directs its actions against the "Most High." The most startling prediction is the intention to change God's "times and laws."

Slide 4 Term Definition: **"Think to change"**

The original language implies an *attempted* change. Because God’s moral law is eternal and immutable (unchangeable), a human power cannot actually alter it in heaven. However, they can attempt to alter it in the minds and practices of people on earth.

Slide 5 Insight: The Aspect of Time

[DYK] The Ten Commandments (God's Law) contain only one commandment dealing with "time"—the fourth commandment regarding the Sabbath. Therefore, a power seeking to change "times and laws" would logically attack the Sabbath.

Slide 6 Question: How does the Apostle Paul describe this same power in the New Testament?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “Except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped.” (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4)

---

Slide 8 Explanation: Paul warns of a "falling away" (apostasy) from *within* the church, not just an attack from without. He describes a "man of sin" who seeks a position of authority superior to God Himself.

Slide 9 Illustration: The Governor and The King

[ILL] Imagine a governor and a king. If a governor creates new minor local laws, he acts alongside the king. But if the governor attempts to *erase* or *rewrite* the fundamental laws established by the king, he is effectively claiming to be higher than the king. To change the Lawgiver's law is to claim the Lawgiver's throne.

Slide 10 Question: According to history and its own admissions, has any power claimed the authority to change biblical laws?

Slide 11 Historical Admission: “Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is not scriptural authority.” (*Doctrinal Catechism*, p. 174)

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The source text identifies the Papacy as the power that fulfills this prophecy. The admission is clear: the shift from the biblical Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday rests not on Scripture, but on church authority.

Slide 13 Progressive Disclosure: The Sequence of Change

1. **The Law**: God commanded the seventh day.
2. **The Change**: History shows a shift to the first day (Sunday).

Slide 14 Progressive Disclosure: The Core Issue

3. **The Authority**: The church claims the power to institute this change.
4. **The Issue**: This act places church tradition above biblical command.

Slide 15 Deep Dive: The Protestant Dilemma

[SN] Discuss how the Protestant motto is *Sola Scriptura* (Scripture Alone), yet many Protestant churches follow the calendar regarding Sunday, which the Catechism notes is an act of acknowledging the Church's power to ordain feasts.

Slide 16 Deep Dive: The Nature of Worship

[SN] True worship is based on obedience to the Creator. The Sabbath is the memorial of Creation; changing it obscures the Creator.

Slide 17 Practical Application: Why is this relevant?

*   **Authority**: Is the Bible my sole authority, or do I follow tradition?
*   **Loyalty**: Keeping the Sabbath is a sign of allegiance to the Creator.
*   **Truth**: God wants us to worship Him "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).
