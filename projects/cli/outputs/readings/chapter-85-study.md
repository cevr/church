Study Title: Shadows and Substance: Distinguishing the Sabbaths

Question: What does the Apostle Paul say was "blotted out" and "nailed to the cross"?

Biblical Answer: “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross... Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” (Colossians 2:14-17)

Explanation: Paul speaks here of a specific system of laws—"ordinances"—that served as "shadows." A shadow is a silhouette cast by a solid object. In the plan of salvation, these ceremonial days and laws were shadows cast by the coming life, death, and ministry of Jesus. Once the "body" (Christ) arrived, the shadows were no longer necessary.

[ILL] Imagine you are waiting for a friend to arrive around a corner. You see their shadow first. You watch the shadow to know they are coming. But once your friend steps into view, you no longer look at the shadow—you embrace the friend. The ceremonial laws were the shadow; Christ is the friend.

Question: Unlike the "handwriting of ordinances," how was the Moral Law (the Ten Commandments) recorded?

Biblical Answer: “And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy 4:13) ... “And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.” (Exodus 32:16)

Explanation: While ceremonial ordinances were written by hand on parchment (which can be blotted out with ink), the Ten Commandments were engraved by God Himself into stone. Stone implies permanence. You cannot "blot out" or erase engravings in stone; they are made to endure. Therefore, the moral law was not the "handwriting" nailed to the cross.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The distinction between "handwriting" (cheirographon) and "God's writing" is vital. The former implies a temporary legal bond or debt note; the latter implies the eternal character of the King. One deals with the method of paying a debt (sacrifices), the other defines the standard of righteousness.

Question: Was the weekly Sabbath part of the ordinances that were "against us"?

Biblical Answer: “And He said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:27)

Explanation: Something created specifically *for* your benefit cannot be described as being *against* you or contrary to you. Jesus affirms that the Sabbath was a gift to humanity, not a burden to be removed.

Question: When was the weekly Sabbath established, and does this timing matter?

Biblical Answer: “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His work...” (Genesis 2:1-3). “And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good.” (Genesis 1:31)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Timing**: Established at Creation.
2.  **Condition**: Established before sin existed.
3.  **Nature**: It was part of a "very good" world.

Deeper Insight: The ceremonial sabbaths (ordinances) were instituted *after* sin entered to point toward a Savior (a remedy for sin). The weekly Sabbath was instituted *before* sin entered as a celebration of Creation. Therefore, the weekly Sabbath cannot be a shadow of redemption; it is a memorial of creation.

Question: Does the Bible explicitly mention other "sabbaths" distinct from the weekly Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath... Also the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement... It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest.” (Leviticus 23:24, 27-32)

Term Definition: **Ceremonial Sabbaths**: These were specific annual dates (like the Day of Atonement) linked to the harvest cycle and the sanctuary service. They could fall on any day of the week. They involved specific sacrifices meant to foreshadow Jesus' sacrifice.

Question: Does Scripture distinguish these annual feast sabbaths from the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “These are the feasts of the Lord... Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts...” (Leviticus 23:37-38)

Explanation: The text draws a sharp line: "Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord." The annual ceremonial days were additions to the spiritual calendar, separate and distinct from the weekly Sabbath established in Eden.

[DYK] The phrase "Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord" indicates that the weekly Sabbath stands apart from the sacrificial system. Even when the sacrificial system (the shadow) met its fulfillment in Christ, the memorial of Creation (the substance of our origin) remained.

Practical Application:
*   **Trust the Substance**: We do not need to offer lambs or keep feast days because we have Jesus, the reality to whom they pointed.
*   **Keep the Memorial**: We keep the weekly Sabbath not to earn salvation, but to celebrate the Creator who made us and the Redeemer who rested in the tomb on the Sabbath after finishing His work on the cross.
*   **Discernment**: As students of the Word, we must rightly divide Scripture, distinguishing between the temporary laws of symbols and the eternal law of love.
