Study Title: The Shadow of the Cross: The Old Testament Sanctuary

---

Slide 1 Question: Why was Abel’s sacrifice accepted while Cain’s was not?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” (Hebrews 11:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abel kneeling reverently beside a sacrificial lamb, looking upward with an expression of trust.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The difference was not merely in the items offered, but in the faith behind them. Abel’s sacrifice involved the shedding of blood, acknowledging that sin brings death and requires a substitute.

---

Slide 4 Insight: This act of faith looked forward to the "precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish" (1 Peter 1:18-20).

[ILL] Imagine a shadow cast by a person standing around a corner. You cannot see the person yet, but the shadow proves they are there. The Old Testament sacrifices were the "shadow" cast by the reality of Jesus Christ’s future sacrifice.

Slide 5 Question: What was God’s purpose in commanding Moses to build a sanctuary in the wilderness?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And let them make Me a sanctuary: that I may dwell among them.” (Exodus 25:8)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: God desired to be close to His people. However, because God is holy and humanity is sinful, a separation existed. The sanctuary system was God’s method of bridging that gap, allowing His presence to dwell in the center of the camp while dealing with the problem of sin.

Slide 8 Did You Know?

[DYK] The sanctuary was portable. It was a tent structure (Tabernacle) about 15 by 45 feet, designed to be taken apart and carried. This symbolizes that God does not wait for us to come to Him; He journeys with His people through their wilderness.

Slide 9 Question: What was the central object in the Most Holy Place, and what did it contain?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.” (Exodus 25:21)

“And He wrote on the tables... the ten commandments... and put the tables in the ark.” (Deuteronomy 10:4-5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ark of the Covenant, gold overlay, with two cherubim facing each other on the top cover.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The Ark of the Covenant contained the moral standard of God's government: the Ten Commandments. Directly above the Law was the "Mercy Seat" (the solid gold cover).

---

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: This arrangement is profound. The Law (justice) demands obedience, but the Mercy Seat (grace) covers it. God communes with man "from above the mercy seat" (Exodus 25:22), signifying that His relationship with us is based on mercy covering the law, made possible by the blood sprinkled there.

[SN] The "Pattern" shown to Moses (Exodus 25:40, Hebrews 8:5) indicates that the earthly sanctuary was a miniature model of a greater, heavenly reality. Just as a blueprint represents a real building, the earthly tabernacle helps us understand the work Christ is currently doing in the heavenly sanctuary.

Slide 13 Question: In the daily service, how was sin transferred from the sinner to the sanctuary?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin-offering in the place of the burnt offering.” (Leviticus 4:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man's hands resting heavily on the head of a sacrificial animal, head bowed in confession.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: This is the doctrine of substitution. The sinner laid their hands on the animal, symbolically transferring their guilt to the innocent victim. The animal died because "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). The priest then took the blood into the sanctuary, symbolically transferring the record of that sin into the Holy Place.

Slide 16 Question: What special event happened once a year to remove these accumulated sins?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large crowd of Israelites standing around the sanctuary courtyard in solemn anticipation.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” (Leviticus 16:30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest wearing a simple white linen tunic, standing amidst smoke from a censer.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: This was the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). While the daily services resulted in the forgiveness of sins and the *transfer* of sin into the sanctuary, the Day of Atonement resulted in the *cleansing* of the sanctuary and the people. It was a day of judgment and final separation from sin.

Term Definition: "Atonement" in this context signifies expiation, satisfaction, and the restoration of a broken relationship. It involves the complete removal of the sin problem.

Slide 19 Question: What happened to the sins after the High Priest finished the work of reconciling the holy place?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest emerging from the Tabernacle to face two goats waiting in the courtyard.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel... putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away... into the wilderness.” (Leviticus 16:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest laying both hands on the head of a live goat while the people watch.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: This second goat (the Scapegoat) was not killed as a sacrifice. Instead, the sins that had been atoned for by the Lord's goat were placed upon the Scapegoat, who was then banished.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Scapegoat (Azazel) represents the originator of sin (Satan). He does not make atonement for us—only the Lord’s goat, whose blood was shed, does that. However, once justice is satisfied by Christ, the ultimate responsibility for the existence of evil is placed back upon its author, and he is removed from God’s presence forever.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application: The sanctuary shows us the complete path of salvation.

1. **The Courtyard**: We accept Jesus as our sacrifice (Justification).
2. **The Holy Place**: We walk daily in the light of the Spirit and the bread of the Word (Sanctification).
3. **The Most Holy Place**: We look forward to the final blotting out of sin and being forever in God's presence (Glorification).

Slide 23 Conclusion: God wants to dwell with you today. Have you invited Him into the "sanctuary" of your heart?
