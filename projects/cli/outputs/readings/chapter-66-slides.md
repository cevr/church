---

Slide 1 Question: How does Scripture describe the character of the "Day of the Lord"?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly... That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress.” (Zephaniah 1:14, 15)

Slide 3 Explanation: The "Day of the Lord" is not a single 24-hour period. It is a decisive epoch in history where God intervenes to settle the account of sin. It is a time characterized by judgment and the final resolution of evil.

[DYK] In biblical prophecy, the word "day" often represents a span of time or an era (such as the "day of salvation"), rather than a literal sunrise-to-sunset period.

Slide 4 Question: What specific signs signal the beginning of this time period?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth... for the great day of His wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?” (Revelation 6:12, 17)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Under the sixth seal, celestial events—the darkening sun, the blood-red moon, and falling stars—serve as harbingers. These signs alert humanity that the transition into the "Day of the Lord" is underway.

[SN] **Historical Context:** Early Adventist pioneers identified these signs with historical events: the Dark Day of May 19, 1780, and the falling of the stars on November 13, 1833. They viewed these as evidence that the end was "even at the doors."

Slide 7 Question: What happens in heaven when the Lord finally descends to earth?

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.” (Revelation 8:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of angelic hosts bowing in profound stillness and reverence, bathed in soft, ethereal light.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: This silence is profound and dramatic. Heaven is temporarily silent because its inhabitants—the holy angels—have vacated it to accompany Christ to gather the faithful from the earth.

[ILL] Imagine a bustling royal court. If the King and all his attendants leave to rescue a lost child, the palace falls completely silent. The silence signifies the King's total focus on the rescue mission.

Slide 10 Question: What defines the resurrection of the dead during this time?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “The dead in Christ shall rise first.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16) ... “But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” (Revelation 20:5)

---

Slide 12 Sequence of Events:
1.  **First Resurrection:** At Christ's coming, only the righteous rise.
2.  **The Interval:** A 1,000-year period (Millennium) separates the resurrections.
3.  **Second Resurrection:** The wicked are raised after the 1,000 years.

Slide 13 Term Definition: **Millennium**
Derived from Latin *mille* (thousand) and *annum* (year). It refers to the thousand-year period in Revelation 20 where saints reign with Christ while the earth remains desolate.

Slide 14 Question: Does the "Day of the Lord" extend to the final destruction of the earth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the earth viewed from a distance, surrounded by the vastness of creation.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise... the earth also; and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a purifying fire sweeping across a landscape, not as destruction, but as a cleansing force.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The "Day of the Lord" encompasses the entire sequence: signs, the Second Coming, the 1,000 years, and the final purification by fire. It ends only with the total eradication of sin.

[ILL] Think of a "Day of Cleaning." It involves preparation, scrubbing, and removing trash. It doesn't truly end until the refuse is burned or hauled away and the house is pristine.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The fire mentioned in Revelation is not an eternal torture chamber, but a cleansing agent. Just as the Flood purified the earth with water, this fire purifies the earth to prepare it for the "new heavens and a new earth."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of gold being refined in a fire, glowing bright and pure, symbolizing the removal of impurities.

---

Slide 18 Practical Application:
*   Are we watching the signs of the times?
*   Are our lives "garments" kept clean through faith in Jesus?
*   Does the promise of the final eradication of sin give us hope?

Slide 19 Conclusion: God has revealed the schedule of the end not to frighten us, but to prepare us so we are not overtaken "as a thief in the night."
