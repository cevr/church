Study Title: The Biblical Definition of a Living Soul

Question: When God created man, what did he become?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7)

Explanation: This verse provides the "creation formula" for humanity. God combined the dust of the ground with the breath of life. The result was not that man *received* a soul to dwell inside him, but rather that the man *became* a living soul. The soul is the whole person—the combination of body and breath.

[ILL] Think of a wooden box. You take planks (dust) and nails (breath) and combine them to make a box (soul). If you pull the nails out and separate the planks, where does the "box" go? It ceases to exist. It implies that without the breath of life from God, the "living soul" does not exist.

Term Definition: “Soul” here comes from the Hebrew word *nephesh*. It literally means "a breathing creature."

Question: Is the term "soul" applied only to human beings?

Biblical Answer: “And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.” (Numbers 31:28)

“And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)

Explanation: Surprisingly to many, Scripture applies the term "soul" to animals—cattle, donkeys, sheep, and sea creatures. This confirms that "soul" refers to living, breathing life, rather than a distinct, immortal spirit entity reserved only for humans.

[DYK] In the King James Version, the Hebrew word *nephesh* is translated as "soul" 428 times, but it is also translated as "life" (119 times), "person" (29 times), and "beast" (2 times). This translation variety sometimes obscures the fact that animals and people are both described as "souls."

Question: Does a soul have physical needs and experiences?

Biblical Answer: 
*   **Thirst:** “As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.” (Proverbs 25:25)
*   **Hunger:** “Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.” (Proverbs 19:15)
*   **Eating:** “But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice...” (Leviticus 7:20)
*   **Injury:** “And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword.” (Joshua 11:11)

Progressive Disclosure: • A soul can be thirsty • A soul can be hungry • A soul eats food • A soul can be physically injured by a sword

Explanation: These texts demonstrate that the soul is physical and tangible. It is not an immaterial ghost that floats free of the body; it is the person themselves who eats, drinks, and can be harmed.

Question: Is the soul immortal, or can it die?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, all souls are Mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4)

Explanation: The Bible clearly states that souls are subject to death. The concept of an "immortal soul" is not found in these texts; rather, immortality is a gift God alone possesses (1 Timothy 6:16) and which the redeemed seek at the resurrection (Romans 2:7).

Deeper Insight: Even Jesus Christ, when He took upon Himself human nature, was subject to this reality. Isaiah 53:12 says He “poured out His soul unto death.” This highlights the totality of His sacrifice—He gave His entire life and being for humanity.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion: • The word *Hades* in the New Testament (Acts 2:31) corresponds to *Sheol* in the Old Testament—simply meaning the grave or the realm of the dead, not a place of burning torment. • The theological implication that if the soul were naturally immortal, death would not be the "wages of sin" (Romans 6:23). • The comfort found in knowing that in death, the believer sleeps peacefully (unconscious) until the call of the Life-giver at the second coming.

Question: Where does the Bible say the soul goes at death?

Biblical Answer: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?” (Psalm 89:48)

“He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in hell [hades], neither His flesh did see corruption.” (Acts 2:31)

Explanation: At death, the soul goes to the grave (often translated as hell or hades in older versions). Even Jesus' soul went to the grave. However, the glorious hope of the Christian faith is that the soul is not left there. Just as Jesus was raised, so too will those who sleep in Him be raised.

Practical Application: Why does this matter? • It helps us understand the value of our physical life and body as a creation of God. • It protects us from spiritualistic deceptions regarding communication with the dead. • It places our hope entirely on the resurrection and the return of Jesus, rather than on a natural immortality we possess on our own.
