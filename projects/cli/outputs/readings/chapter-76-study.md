Study Title: The Two Covenants: Promises of Man vs. Promises of God

Question: When God approached Israel at Sinai, what proposal did He make to them?

Biblical Answer: “Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people...” (Exodus 19:5)

Explanation: God offered a special relationship based on mutual agreement. If the people obeyed, they would be His "peculiar treasure" (special possession).

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "peculiar treasure" is *segullah*, referring to a king’s private wealth or personal jewel, separate from the public treasury. God wanted a personal, intimate connection with His people.

Question: How did the people respond to God’s proposal?

Biblical Answer: “And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.” (Exodus 19:8)

Explanation: The people immediately pledged full obedience. This agreement—God’s law and the people’s promise to keep it in their own strength—constituted the "Old Covenant."

Question: What specific standard was the core of this covenant?

Biblical Answer: “And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy 4:13)

Term Definition: "Covenant" means a binding contract or agreement between two parties. Here, the Ten Commandments formed the basis of the agreement.

Question: Why was a "New Covenant" necessary? Was there a flaw in the law?

Biblical Answer: “For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second... But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry... established upon better promises.” (Hebrews 8:7, 6)

Explanation: The text says the "first covenant" was not faultless. The fault was not with God's law (which is holy), but with the "promises." The Old Covenant relied on the people's promise ("We will do"), which they ultimately broke.

[ILL] Imagine a child trying to lift a heavy boulder to please their father. The child promises, "I will lift it," but lacks the strength. The failure isn't the father's fault for asking, nor the boulder's fault for being heavy; the failure lies in the child's reliance on their own limited strength.

Question: What are the "better promises" of the New Covenant?

Biblical Answer: “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.” (Hebrews 8:10)

Progressive Disclosure: • Old Covenant: "We will do" (Human effort) • New Covenant: "I [God] will do" (Divine power)

Deeper Insight: Notice that the *Law* does not change; its *location* changes. In the Old Covenant, the law was on tables of stone (external rule). In the New Covenant, God writes the same law on the heart (internal desire).

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangent: The "New" Covenant is actually older than the "Old." The promise of salvation through faith (the Gospel) was given to Adam and Abraham long before Sinai. The covenant at Sinai was introduced to show the people their sinfulness and their inability to be righteous without a Savior (Galatians 3:19).

Question: How is the New Covenant ratified (made legally valid)?

Biblical Answer: “And for this cause he [Christ] is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death... they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.” (Hebrews 9:15)

Explanation: A testament (will/covenant) requires a death to be in force. The Old Covenant was ratified with the blood of animals (Exodus 24:8), which could not take away sin. The New Covenant is ratified by the blood of Jesus Christ.

Question: If we cannot earn salvation by our works, does that mean we do not obey?

Biblical Answer: “I will put My spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep My judgments, and do them.” (Ezekiel 36:27 - cross-reference to Jer 31:33)

Explanation: Under the New Covenant, obedience is the *result* of salvation, not the cause. God's Spirit enters the heart and empowers the believer to live a life that pleases God. It is His work in us.

[ILL] A manual transmission car requires the driver to constantly work the gears. An automatic car shifts because of the mechanism inside it. The New Covenant is like having a new engine installed—the Holy Spirit—that drives us toward righteousness naturally.

Question: How do we enter into this New Covenant relationship today?

Biblical Answer: “Submit yourselves therefore to God... Yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.” (James 4:7; Romans 6:13)

Practical Application: To live in the New Covenant, we must:
• Stop relying on our own promises to "be good."
• Admit our inability to keep the law in our own strength.
• Submit to Christ, allowing Him to write His law of love in our hearts.
• Trust that His blood covers our past failures and His Spirit empowers our future obedience.
