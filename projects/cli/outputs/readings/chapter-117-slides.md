Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.” (Leviticus 19:31)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible is explicit: God’s people must not seek information or comfort from mediums. God calls this interaction "defiling." In the Old Testament, this was linked to idolatry and rebellion against God’s direct guidance.

[DYK] In the ancient world, necromancy (consulting the dead) was a common religious practice among pagan nations surrounding Israel. God’s prohibition set His people apart, teaching them to rely solely on Him rather than the occult.

Slide 4 Question: If we encounter supernatural signs or spirits, by what standard must we test them?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20)

Slide 6 Explanation: Not every supernatural event is from God. The ultimate test is whether the message aligns with God’s Law and His written Word. If a manifestation contradicts Scripture, it must be rejected, no matter how impressive it appears.

Slide 7 Illustration: The Counterfeit.

[ILL] Imagine a counterfeiter who creates a bill that looks perfect to the naked eye. To detect the fraud, a banker doesn't rely on how "nice" the bill looks, but tests it against the master standard. We must test all spiritual experiences against the master standard of the Bible.

Slide 8 Question: Why does the Bible warn us against speaking to the dead? Do the dead know what is happening on earth?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything... Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6)

Slide 10 Progressive Disclosure: The State of the Dead
*   The dead are unconscious.
*   They have no memory of current events.
*   Their emotions (love, hate) have ceased.
*   They do not interact with the world ("under the sun").

Slide 11 Term Definition: "Sleep"

"Sleep" is the term Jesus and the apostles frequently used to describe death (John 11:11-14). It implies a state of unconscious rest until the resurrection, not an active existence in a spirit world.

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: The Safeguard.

This doctrine is a protection. If the dead "know not anything," then any spirit claiming to be a deceased loved one is an imposter. Understanding this protects the believer from emotional manipulation by deceptive spirits.

Slide 13 Question: If the dead are sleeping, who are the spirits that appear and perform miracles?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shadowed figure in a hooded robe, holding a false light that casts eerie, unnatural shadows.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world...” (Revelation 16:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of kings and rulers listening intently to shadowy, whispering figures, with a subtle chaotic atmosphere.

Slide 15 Explanation: The Bible reveals that fallen angels have the power to work miracles and disguise themselves. Paul warns that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14). These entities impersonate the dead to lead people away from the truth.

[SN] The rise of modern spiritualism in the mid-19th century coincided with a renewed interest in biblical prophecy. The "knocking" phenomena began in 1848, suggesting a counterfeit movement arose to distract from the recovery of biblical truth.

Slide 16 Question: What will be a specific danger in the "latter times"?

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” (1 Timothy 4:1)

Slide 18 Practical Application: How do we stay safe from deception?

1.  **Study the Word:** Know the Bible to detect error.
2.  **Trust God's Care:** Seek God, not mediums.
3.  **Wait for the Resurrection:** Hope in Jesus' return, not in ghosts.
