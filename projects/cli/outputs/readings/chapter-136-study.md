Study Title: Diligence: The Pathway to Peace and Prosperity

Question: What tangible benefits does the Bible promise to those who are faithful and energetic in their work?

Biblical Answer: “He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread.” (Prov. 28:19) “The hand of the diligent maketh rich.” (Prov. 10:4) “The soul of the diligent shall be made fat.” (Prov. 13:4)

Explanation: Scripture presents work not as a curse, but as the God-ordained method for sustaining life. The "tilling of land" represents active engagement with our responsibilities. The promise is that effort leads to provision ("plenty of bread").

Term Definition: “Fat” in the context of Proverbs 13:4 does not refer to physical weight, but to a state of prosperity, abundance, and deep satisfaction. It is the opposite of a "lean" or starving soul.

[DYK] In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, survival depended directly on daily physical labor. There were no safety nets; if you did not plant and harvest, you did not eat. This created a culture that viewed idleness as a direct threat to life.

Question: Conversely, what are the consequences of dealing with life using a "slack hand"?

Biblical Answer: “He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand.” (Prov. 10:4) “The soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing.” (Prov. 13:4)

Explanation: A "slack hand" describes negligence, laziness, or a lack of tension and focus. The sluggard lives in a state of perpetual desire—wanting the rewards of labor without paying the price of effort—resulting in emptiness.

[ILL] Imagine an archer. To hit the target, they must pull the bowstring tight with tension and focus. A "slack" string has no power and cannot launch the arrow. Similarly, a life without the tension of discipline cannot reach its goals.

Question: How does diligence affect a person’s social standing and influence?

Biblical Answer: “The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute.” (Prov. 12:24) “See thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.” (Prov. 22:29)

Progressive Disclosure: • Competence leads to influence • Laziness leads to dependence • Quality work is noticed by leadership

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This principle was exemplified by Daniel and Joseph. Both were captives in foreign lands, yet their exceptional diligence and "excellent spirit" raised them to the right hand of kings. It suggests that faithful work is a form of witness to the world.

Question: What happens to our physical surroundings when we neglect them?

Biblical Answer: “By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.” (Eccl. 10:18) “I went by the field of the slothful... and lo, it was all grown over with thorns... and the stone wall thereof was broken down.” (Prov. 24:30-31)

Explanation: The wise man (Solomon) observed that the natural state of a fallen world is entropy and decay. Without active maintenance ("diligence"), order turns to chaos. Thorns and broken walls are the natural result of doing nothing.

Deeper Insight: The "thorns" mentioned in Proverbs 24 harken back to Genesis 3, where the ground was cursed because of sin. Diligence is man’s way of fighting back against the curse, cultivating beauty and order in a fallen world.

Question: Is there a connection between our secular work and our spiritual life?

Biblical Answer: “Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.” (Rom. 12:11) “Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully.” (Jer. 48:10)

Explanation: The Apostle Paul links business diligence directly with spiritual fervor. The Christian cannot be lazy in their daily vocation and expect to be vibrant in their spiritual walk. The word "deceitfully" in Jeremiah can also be translated as "negligently." God calls for our best in all things.

[SN] Historical Note: The early Adventists and Puritans held to the "Protestant Work Ethic"—the belief that secular work was a vocation (calling) from God. Doing one's trade well was an act of worship. Ellen White frequently wrote that practical duties are the discipline God uses to fit us for higher responsibilities.

Question: How does the quality of diligence relate to our preparation for the Second Coming of Christ?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot and blameless.” (2 Peter 3:14) “Give diligence to make your calling and election sure...” (2 Peter 1:10)

Explanation: Waiting for Christ is not a passive activity; it is an active one. We are to be diligent in character building, ensuring that when He returns, we are found in peace.

Term Definition: “Election” refers to God’s choice of us. By "making it sure," Peter means we confirm God’s choice by living in a way that demonstrates the reality of our faith. We do not earn salvation, but our diligence reveals the genuineness of our transformation.

Practical Application: Where do we need to apply diligence today?
• In our careers: working with integrity as if working for God.
• In our homes: maintaining order and peace.
• In our spiritual lives: consistently studying the Word and praying.
• In our character: actively rooting out "thorns" of sin before they overgrow the garden of the heart.
