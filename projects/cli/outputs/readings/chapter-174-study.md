Study Title: True Wisdom and the Call to Sobriety

Question: To what extent did Solomon, the wisest man in Scripture, test the pleasures of the world, and what was the result?

Biblical Answer: “Whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy... I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure.” (Ecclesiastes 2:10, 2:1) “Behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 2:11)

Explanation: Solomon possessed the wealth and power to deny himself nothing. He treated pleasure as an experiment to see if it offered lasting satisfaction. His conclusion was that a life devoted merely to "mirth" (entertainment and amusement) leaves the soul empty and "vexed" (troubled).

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, kings often maintained vast courts designed for constant entertainment. Solomon had access to the best musicians, gardens, and luxuries of his day, yet he found them hollow without God.

Question: Why does the Bible suggest that seriousness and even sorrow can be better than laughter?

Biblical Answer: “Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.” (Ecclesiastes 7:3) “It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.” (Ecclesiastes 7:2)

Explanation: This does not mean God desires us to be unhappy. Rather, it teaches that constant amusement distracts us from the realities of life and eternity. Moments of seriousness—and even mourning—force us to reflect on our mortality and our standing before God, which improves our character ("makes the heart better").

[ILL] A diet consisting only of candy tastes good for a moment but leaves the body weak and sick. Similarly, a life fed only on entertainment ("laughter") leaves the spiritual character weak. Sobriety is the solid food that builds spiritual muscle.

Term Definition: **Sobriety** — While often associated with abstaining from alcohol, in the biblical sense, "being sober" (Greek *nepho*) implies a clear head, mental self-control, and a serious, watchful attitude toward life and salvation.

Question: What specific instruction is given to the church regarding this serious mindset?

Biblical Answer: “That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate... The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becometh holiness... Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.” (Titus 2:2-6)

Explanation: Paul instructs Titus that every demographic in the church—young and old, men and women—is called to the same standard of a "sober mind." Holiness requires a behavior that is "grave" (dignified) and "temperate" (self-controlled).

Question: Why is this mental vigilance and sobriety so dangerous to neglect?

Biblical Answer: “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour.” (1 Peter 5:8)

Explanation: We are in the midst of a spiritual conflict. A soldier on the battlefield cannot afford to be intoxicated or distracted by entertainment; they must be alert. The adversary looks for those who are spiritually asleep or distracted by the "cares of this life."

[SN] Early Adventist pioneers often emphasized the "watching" position. They viewed the believer as a watchman on the walls of Zion. Just as the priests in the Sanctuary had to keep the lamps trimmed and burning through the night, the believer must maintain a sober watchfulness against the darkness of the enemy.

Question: What future event should motivate us to remain sober and watchful?

Biblical Answer: “But the end of all things is at hand; be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.” (1 Peter 4:7) “Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth... but know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.” (Ecclesiastes 11:9)

Progressive Disclosure: • The end of the world is near • Judgment is real • Prayer requires a clear mind • We are accountable for how we spend our time

Deeper Insight: The proximity of the "end of all things" changes our priorities. When a deadline is approaching, we stop trifling and focus on what matters. Peter connects sobriety directly to prayer; a mind cluttered with worldly "mirth" struggles to pray effectively.

[ILL] If you knew a thief was planning to break into your house tonight, you would not spend the evening distracted by games or drowsy with wine. You would be awake, lights on, watching the door. Because we know the end is near, we "gird up the loins of our mind" (1 Peter 1:13).

Practical Application: How can we practice biblical sobriety today?
• Limiting mindless entertainment that clouds our spiritual perception.
• Engaging in deep, thoughtful prayer rather than rushed repetition.
• Remembering that our actions have eternal weight ("God will bring thee into judgment").
• Living with the expectation of Jesus’ soon return.
