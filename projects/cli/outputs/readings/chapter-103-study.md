Study Title: What is Man?

Question: In what condition was man created compared to the angels?

Biblical Answer: “What is man, that thou art mindful of him? ...Thou madest him a little lower than the angels.” (Hebrews 2:6, 7)

Explanation: Humanity was created distinct from the angelic host. While angels are "spirits" (Heb. 1:7) and possess a nature that does not die (Luke 20:36), man was created "lower," meaning he does not possess their undying nature by default.

[DYK] In the hierarchy of creation, man is unique—formed of the dust yet crowned with glory and honor, placed as the ruler of the earth, yet physically distinct from the celestial beings.

Question: How was man formed, and what makes him a "living soul"?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7)

Term Definition: **Living Soul**: The union of body (dust) and spirit (breath). Notice the text does not say man *was given* a soul, but that he *became* a soul.

[ILL] Consider a wooden box. It is made of boards and nails. If you pull the nails out and separate the boards, where is the box? It is gone. It only exists when the parts are united. Similarly, man is a soul only when the dust and the breath of life are united.

Question: Is the term "living soul" applied only to humans?

Biblical Answer: “And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea... and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)

Explanation: The Bible applies the term "living soul" (or creature) to animals as well. Both man and beast possess the "breath of life" (Genesis 7:21-22). They share the same breath, so that naturally speaking, "a man hath no pre-eminence above a beast" (Ecclesiastes 3:19) regarding his physical composition.

Question: Is man naturally immortal (unable to die)?

Biblical Answer: “Shall mortal man be more just than God?” (Job 4:17)

Explanation: Scripture defines man as "mortal," which means "subject to death." We are not created with an inherent, indefeasible life source within ourselves.

[SN] Linguistics: The word "immortal" is never applied to the soul of man in the KJV Bible. It is a quality that belongs strictly to the Divine nature until it is bestowed upon the faithful.

Question: Who is the only One who possesses immortality by nature?

Biblical Answer: “Who is the blessed and only potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords: who only hath immortality.” (1 Timothy 6:15, 16)

Explanation: Only God is the source of unborrowed, underived life. Man’s life is a loan from God.

Question: What happens to the "spirit" when a person dies?

Biblical Answer: “Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.” (Ecclesiastes 12:7)

Explanation: Death is creation in reverse. The dust returns to the ground. The "spirit"—defined by Job 27:3 as the "breath of life" in the nostrils—returns to God. This spirit is the power of life, not a conscious entity capable of thinking or feeling apart from the body.

Deeper Insight: Because the "spirit" returns to God, the person ceases to be a "living soul" until the resurrection. As the text notes, "unless that were brought back to man, he would be forever unconscious in death."

Question: If we are mortal, how do we obtain immortality?

Biblical Answer: “To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, eternal life.” (Romans 2:7)

Explanation: We do not seek for something we already have. We must seek immortality through the Gospel. It has been "brought to light" through Jesus Christ (2 Timothy 1:10).

Question: When will the faithful actually receive this immortality?

Biblical Answer: “In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump... and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For... this mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Corinthians 15:52, 53)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Current State**: We are natural, mortal beings (living souls).
2.  **The Requirement**: We must have the Son to have life (1 John 5:12).
3.  **The Event**: The Resurrection (the last trumpet).
4.  **The Result**: We put on immortality and death is swallowed up in victory.

Practical Application: Since we do not have life in ourselves, our entire hope rests in Christ. Our life is currently "hid with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3). We can face mortality with courage, knowing that the Giver of Life will restore us when He appears.
