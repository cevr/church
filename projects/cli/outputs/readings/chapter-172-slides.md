Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.” (Matthew 5:27, 28)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus teaches that the commandment is not limited to physical actions. It encompasses the desires, the eyes, and the thoughts. Sin begins in the secret chambers of the mind before it is ever acted out in the body.

[DYK] In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus was not destroying the law but magnifying it (Isaiah 42:21). He showed that God claims jurisdiction over the "inner man" as well as the outward conduct.

Slide 4 Question: What is the inevitable result of allowing corrupt thoughts to dwell in the mind?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption...” (Galatians 6:7, 8)

Slide 6 Explanation: The law of cause and effect applies to our moral nature. Just as a farmer cannot plant thistles and expect to harvest wheat, we cannot "sow" impure thoughts and expect to reap a holy character.

Slide 7 Illustration: The Mind as a Garden

[ILL] Think of the mind as a garden. If you allow weeds (impure thoughts) to take root, they will eventually choke out the good plants. You cannot merely wish for a clean garden; you must actively cultivate it.

Slide 8 Term Definition: Corruption

**Corruption:** Refers to decay, ruin, and moral perishability. It is the opposite of "life everlasting."

Slide 9 Question: How does a pure heart affect our speech?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two disciples conversing earnestly on a walking path, their expressions kind and engaged.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “...for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” (Matthew 12:34) “Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying...” (Ephesians 4:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a clear, fresh spring of water bubbling up from a rock, symbolizing the overflow of the heart.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Speech is the overflow of the heart. If the reservoir is clean, the stream will be clear. The Christian is called to avoid "foolish talking" and replace it with words that build others up.

Slide 12 Speaker Note: The Influence of Consumption

[SN] The text warns that "evil communications corrupt good manners" (1 Cor 15:33). This applies powerfully to modern media. What we read and watch leaves an indelible mark on the conscience. A "social quarantine" from bad influences is often necessary for spiritual health.

Slide 13 Question: What is the biblical method for maintaining a pure mind?

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure... think on these things.” (Philippians 4:8) “Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” (2 Corinthians 10:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a soldier standing guard at a city gate, watchful and alert, representing the guarding of the mind.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The most effective way to remove darkness is to introduce light. We are to "bring into captivity" our wandering thoughts—this implies an active battle. By filling the mind with high, holy, and lovely themes, we leave no room for the "works of the flesh."

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Active Virtue

Purity is not merely the absence of evil, but the presence of active virtue. It requires "incessant mental occupation" with the things of God.

Slide 17 Illustration: The Displacement Principle

[ILL] You cannot empty a glass of air by scooping it out. But if you pour water into the glass, the air is displaced instantly. Similarly, we displace impure thoughts by pouring in the Water of Life—Scripture and prayer.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of clear water being poured from a pitcher into a cup, overflowing, soft golden light highlighting the water.

---

Slide 18 Question: What promise is given to those who strive for this purity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure looking upward toward a break in the clouds, an expression of hope and longing.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.” (Matthew 5:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Transfiguration, a blindingly bright and holy light, figures bowing in reverence.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Only those who are like God can enjoy His presence. Purity fits the believer for the society of heaven. While the struggle against the flesh is real, the reward is the beatific vision of God Himself.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of angels ascending and descending, a glimpse of the heavenly society.

Slide 21 Historical Example: Joseph

[SN] Consider Joseph in Egypt (Gen 39). He faced "insidious temptation" but refused to sin against God. Though he temporarily lost his freedom, he maintained his purity and was eventually exalted.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Joseph in Egypt, turning away from a shadowed doorway, his face set with determination and integrity.

Slide 22 Practical Application: Guarding the Heart

• Monitor what "seeds" enter through media.
• Choose holy companions.
• Turn immediately to prayer when tempted.
• Remember: God understands our thoughts from afar (Psalm 139:2).
