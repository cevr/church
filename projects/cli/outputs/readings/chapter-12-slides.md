Slide 1 Question: In what words did Moses speak of the coming Messiah, and how do we know this referred to Jesus?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto Him ye shall hearken.” (Deuteronomy 18:15)

Slide 3 Confirmation: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you... Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after... have likewise foretold of these days.” (Acts 3:22, 24)

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Moses was the great deliverer and lawgiver of Israel. He prophesied that God would raise up another Prophet "like unto me"—a deliverer from the bondage of sin. The Apostle Peter confirms in Acts that Jesus is the fulfillment of this ancient promise.

Slide 5 Spirit-Led Tangent: Consider the parallels between Moses and Christ:
• Both were preserved from slaughter as infants.
• Both renounced a royal court to help their brethren.
• Both fasted for 40 days.
• Both established a covenant between God and His people.
• Both interceded for the people when they sinned.

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel.” (Micah 5:2)

Slide 8 Fulfillment: “Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king.” (Matthew 2:1)

---

Slide 9 Did You Know? Bethlehem means "House of Bread." It is fitting that Jesus, who called Himself the "Bread of Life" (John 6:35), was born in a place named for sustenance.

Slide 10 Question: Under what striking emblem did Balaam prophesy of Christ?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel.” (Numbers 24:17)

Slide 12 New Testament Affirmation: “I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.” (Revelation 22:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ in glory, radiating light like the dawn, historically respectful and majestic.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The "Star" represents light and guidance, while the "Scepter" represents kingly authority. In the New Testament, Jesus claims this title for Himself. Interestingly, a literal star guided the wise men to His birthplace.

Slide 14 Question: How was the Messiah’s ministry and reception described by the prophet Isaiah?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Isaiah writing on a scroll, his expression solemn and contemplative.

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief... He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.” (Isaiah 53:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking alone through a crowd, looking downcast, with people turning their backs to him.

---

Slide 16 Fulfillment: “He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.” (John 1:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a closed door in a stone wall, representing rejection, with a figure walking away in the distance.

---

Slide 17 Term Definition: **"Man of Sorrows"**: This title indicates that Jesus did not live a life of ease. He bore the weight of human sin and felt the depth of human sadness, allowing Him to sympathize fully with our weaknesses.

---

Slide 18 Illustration: Imagine a doctor who not only prescribes a cure but contracts the disease to understand the patient's pain. Jesus entered into our sorrow so He could effectively heal it.

Slide 19 Question: What specific details regarding the crucifixion were foretold centuries in advance?

Slide 20 Biblical Answer (Silence): “He was oppressed... yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.” (Isaiah 53:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a white lamb standing silently, illuminated by a beam of light.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer (Suffering): “They gave Me also gall for My meat; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.” (Psalm 69:21) ... “They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.” (Psalm 22:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Roman soldiers sitting on the ground, casting lots for a seamless robe.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: These are not vague predictions; they are specific circumstances enacted by Roman soldiers who had likely never read the Hebrew prophets. They cast lots for His coat and offered Him vinegar, fulfilling every word.

---

Slide 23 Deeper Insight: The reference to the "lamb to the slaughter" connects the death of Jesus directly to the Sanctuary service. Just as the innocent lamb died for the sinner in the Old Testament ritual, Christ, the true Lamb of God, remained silent and submissive to save humanity.

Slide 24 Question: What was predicted regarding the burial of the Messiah?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a garden setting with a stone tomb cut into the rock face.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “And He made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death.” (Isaiah 53:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rich man's tomb, clean and prepared with linens, soft light entering from the entrance.

---

Slide 26 Fulfillment: “A rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph... begged the body of Jesus... and laid it in His own new tomb.” (Matthew 27:57-60)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus carrying the body of Jesus wrapped in white linen.

---

Slide 27 Explanation: Although Jesus died a criminal’s death ("with the wicked"), God’s providence ensured He was buried with honor in a rich man’s tomb, exactly as Isaiah predicted.

[SN] **Historical Context:** In Roman custom, crucifixion victims were often thrown into a common grave. The intervention of Joseph of Arimathea was a deviation from standard procedure, yet necessary to fulfill Scripture.

---

Slide 28 Practical Application: If God so accurately fulfilled the prophecies regarding Christ’s first coming—down to the town of His birth and the drink offered at His death—we can have absolute confidence that His promises regarding the Second Coming will also come to pass.
