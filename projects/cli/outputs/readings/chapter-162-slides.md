Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?” (Proverbs 27:4)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Anger may be an explosive, temporary outburst, but envy is dangerous because it is persistent and hidden. Wrath inflicts a wound, but envy plots the destruction of the character. It is a cold, calculated malice.

Slide 4 Illustration: Anger is like a flash flood—destructive but passing. Envy is like mold or dry rot in a foundation; it works silently and continuously until the entire structure collapses.

Slide 5 Question: How does Scripture describe the intensity and cruelty of jealousy?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.” (Song of Solomon 8:6)

Slide 7 Term Definition: “Cruel as the grave” refers to *Sheol*. The grave is unyielding; it never returns the dead and cannot be bribed. Jealousy is equally relentless in its demands.

Slide 8 Deeper Insight: The "vehement flame" in the original Hebrew is the "flame of Yah" (God). While God’s jealousy is a protective zeal, human jealousy often twists this passion into a destructive fire that consumes relationships.

Slide 9 Question: What was the root cause of the first murder in human history?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Cain and Abel in a field, one looking toward heaven, the other looking at the ground in shadow.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.” (1 John 3:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Cain standing apart, face cast in shadow, watching Abel offer a sacrifice in the distance.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Cain’s violence was not born of sudden rage, but of deep-seated envy regarding spiritual things. He could not tolerate a righteousness that exposed his own lack of faith.

[SN] The Spirit of Prophecy highlights that end-time persecution will mirror the spirit of Cain—a religious intolerance where the "wicked" envy the character of the "righteous."

Slide 12 Question: Can a person be guilty of murder without physically harming someone?

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.” (1 John 3:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heart visible within a chest, shadowed and dark, symbolizing the internal root of sin.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: The Bible traces sin back to the motive. Hatred is the seed; murder is the fruit. Harboring the spirit of envy places one in the same category as the murderer in the eyes of God.

Slide 15 Question: What physical and spiritual effect does envy have on the person who harbors it?

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.” (Proverbs 14:30)

---

Slide 17 Explanation: A "sound heart" implies a tranquil spirit. Envy acts as a disease, destroying spiritual peace and affecting physical health. It eats away at the vessel that holds it.

[ILL] If you put acid in a metal container to throw at an enemy, the acid eats through the container long before it reaches the target. Envy damages the envious person first.

Slide 18 Question: What is the ultimate fate of those who refuse to let go of envy?

Slide 20 Explanation: Heaven is a place of perfect love and selflessness. A heart ruled by envy—which seeks to pull others down—is incompatible with the atmosphere of heaven and the character of God.

Slide 21 Question: Since envy springs from the heart, what is our duty?

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.” (Proverbs 4:23)

**Practical Steps:**
• **Confess** the feeling immediately.
• **Pray** for the person you envy.
• **Rejoice** in God’s specific plan for you.
• **Guard** against comparison.
