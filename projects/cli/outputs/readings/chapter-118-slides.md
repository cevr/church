Slide 2 Question: How can a mother bind the hearts of her family together?

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness.” (Proverbs 31:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a woman speaking gently to children gathered around her, an open scroll on her lap, glowing with soft golden light.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: The atmosphere of the home is largely determined by the tone of speech. Wisdom creates stability, but kindness creates the bond. The “law of kindness” is not an occasional impulse, but the ruling principle of the household.

[DYK] Proverbs 31 is an acrostic poem in Hebrew, where each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It was traditionally memorized to teach the ideal attributes of wisdom in action within the home.

Slide 5 Question: Is there a mutual obligation between parents and children in a godly home?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Children, obey your parents in the Lord... And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:1, 4)

Slide 7 Term Definition: **Nurture vs. Admonition**

*   **Nurture:** Training through discipline and action.
*   **Admonition:** Training through words and instruction.

A balanced home requires both example and teaching.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Garden Analogy

[ILL] A garden requires both a fence for protection (discipline) and water for growth (nurture). If you only have the fence, nothing grows; if you only have water without protection, the wild animals (the world) destroy the crop.

Slide 9 Question: Moving from the earthly home to the spiritual realm, what two families exist in the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large crowd of people, subtly separated into two groups by lighting or positioning, representing two distinct lineages.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.” (Matthew 13:38) ... “In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil.” (1 John 3:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wheat field where wheat and weeds (tares) are growing side by side, ready for harvest.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: While there are many nations and races, spiritually there are only two lineages. Every human being belongs either to the family of God or the family of the enemy. There is no neutral ground.

Slide 12 Question: How do we identify the true children of God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing in a doorway, holding a lamp up to inspect those entering.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me... and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.” (John 14:21)

Slide 14 Progressive Disclosure: The Spiritual Sequence

1.  **Love** is the root.
2.  **Obedience** is the fruit.
3.  **Divine manifestation** is the result.

---

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: Obedience is not a method to *earn* entrance into the family, but the natural characteristic of those who *are* in the family. A child of God shares the character (Law) of their Heavenly Father.

[SN] **The Great Controversy Context**: This binary distinction—children of God vs. children of the Devil—reflects the cosmic conflict. In the beginning, God established a family in Eden. Satan attempted to hijack this family. The plan of redemption is essentially God winning back His children. The defining mark of the loyal family is adherence to the Father's will.

Slide 16 Question: How can we distinguish between a genuine child of God and a counterfeit?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two identical looking coins or vessels, one being examined closely by a wise merchant.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” (2 Timothy 3:5) ... “They profess that they know God, but in works, they deny Him...” (Titus 1:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Pharisee praying loudly on a street corner, while his shadow looks dark and distorted.

Slide 18 Question: What is the ultimate test?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a hand reaching out to examine fruit hanging from a branch.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matthew 7:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a basket overflowing with good, ripe fruit, illuminated by a beam of sunlight.

---

Slide 20 Illustration: The Apple Tree

[ILL] You can tie an apple onto a dead stick, and it may look like an apple tree from a distance (a form of godliness). But a living apple tree produces the fruit naturally from the inside out because of the life in the sap (the Holy Spirit).

Slide 21 Question: If we find we are "children of wrath" by nature, how do we change families?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a traveler at a crossroads, turning away from a dark, rocky path toward a path filled with light.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.” (James 4:7, 8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure kneeling in humility, casting a shadow behind them as they face a glorious light.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: Changing families requires a transfer of allegiance. We must stop submitting to the "wicked one" and submit to the Father. This is an act of the will, empowered by God’s grace.

Slide 24 Question: How does God feel about adopting us into His family?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father looking with deep emotion and love toward the horizon, waiting.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.” (1 John 3:1)

[SN] **The Concept of Adoption**: In Roman law, an adopted son had all the legal rights of a natural-born son, and his previous debts were canceled. When we accept the "manner of love" God bestows, our past debt of sin is wiped away, and we become full heirs.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father placing a royal robe on the shoulders of a kneeling son, symbolizing adoption and restoration.

---

Slide 26 Question: What is the final destiny of the two families?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic sky, one side fading into nothingness, the other opening into a glorious city.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer:
*   **The Wicked:** “The wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” (Psalm 37:10)
*   **God's Family:** “And every creature... heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne.” (Revelation 5:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast multitude in white robes surrounding a glowing throne.

---

Slide 28 Deeper Insight: The text indicates that the wicked "shall not be." This aligns with the truth that sin is not eternal. God’s universe will eventually be cleansed, leaving only one united family praising Him forever.

Slide 29 Practical Application

1.  **Home Check**: Is the "law of kindness" ruling our earthly homes today?
2.  **Heart Check**: Do our "fruits" prove we belong to the Family of God?
3.  **Action**: If you feel far from God, He says, "Draw nigh to Me."
