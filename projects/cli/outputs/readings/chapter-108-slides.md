Slide 1 Question: How does the Bible describe the condition of those who have died?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.” (1 Thessalonians 4:13)

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible consistently uses the metaphor of "sleep" to represent death. Just as a sleeping person is unconscious of their surroundings and the passing of time until they wake, the dead are resting in a state of unconsciousness until the resurrection.

Slide 4 Did You Know: Jesus Himself used this specific terminology. When His friend Lazarus died, Jesus told His disciples, “Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep” (John 11:11).

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything… Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5-6)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Scripture teaches that death is a cessation of life and thought, not a continuation of it in a different place. All mental and emotional activity pauses.

Slide 8 Term Definition: "Perish" in Psalm 146:4 ("his thoughts perish") implies a complete ending or ceasing to function. It suggests that the mind does not continue to operate independently of the body.

Slide 9 Illustration: Imagine a deep, dreamless sleep at night. You close your eyes, and the very next moment—to your perception—it is morning. Hours passed, the world moved on, but you were resting peacefully, unaware of the time. This is the biblical picture of death.

Slide 10 Question: Do the dead watch over their families or know if their loved ones are happy or sad?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.” (Job 14:21)

---

Slide 12 Explanation: This truth is actually a great mercy. If the righteous dead were in heaven immediately, their joy would be marred by looking down and seeing the trials, griefs, or mistakes of their loved ones on earth. God protects them in the grave, where they rest unaware of earthly troubles.

Slide 13 Speaker Note: Consider the logic of the Judgment. If a person went immediately to heaven (reward) or hell (punishment) at the moment of death, what would be the purpose of the Judgment Day at the end of time? The fact that judgment is future implies that the dead are currently waiting in their "sleeping" state.

Slide 14 Question: Are the righteous dead, like King David, already in heaven?

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “For David is not ascended into the heavens.” (Acts 2:34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Peter speaking to a crowd in Jerusalem, pointing emphatically.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The Apostle Peter, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit long after David died, confirmed that David was still in his grave. He is waiting for the same event that all believers wait for: the resurrection.

Slide 17 Question: What is the great hope for those who sleep in death?

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ descending in clouds of glory, surrounded by angels, with a trumpet sounding.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The Christian hope is not death itself, but the *resurrection* from the dead. The dead sleep in the dust only until the Life-giver, Jesus Christ, returns to wake them up.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: Job expressed this confidence beautifully: “All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come” (Job 14:14). He knew the grave was not a permanent home, but a waiting room for the call of God.

Slide 21 Practical Application: Why is this view of death comforting?
• It removes the fear of our loved ones suffering right now.
• It assures us they are not grieving over our pain.
• It centers our hope on the Return of Jesus.
• It validates that death is a defeated enemy, merely a temporary sleep.
