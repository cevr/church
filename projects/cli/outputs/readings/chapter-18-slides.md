Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 18:3)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: "Conversion" means a turning or a change from one state to another. Just as a rough field is converted into a garden, a human being must be changed from a state of sin to a state of holiness. It is the beginning of a new life, not just an improvement of the old one.

---

Slide 4 Word Study: The Greek word for "convert" is *strepho*, which implies physically turning around. It suggests the sinner is walking away from God and must completely pivot to face Him.

Slide 5 Question: What are the two essential steps to experience this change?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Conversion stands on two pillars:
1. **Repentance toward God:** Recognizing we have broken His law.
2. **Faith toward Jesus:** Trusting in His sacrifice to fix what we have broken.

Slide 8 Question: Why is repentance necessary, and what defines the sin we must repent of?

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.” (1 John 3:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses holding the stone tablets, the commandments visible, with a reverent atmosphere.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: To understand why we need a Savior, we must understand sin. The Bible defines sin as breaking God’s moral law. Without the law, there is no standard to measure righteousness.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a measuring reed and a set of scales resting on a stone surface, symbolizing judgment and standards.

---

Slide 11 Illustration: Imagine a mirror. If your face is dirty, the mirror reveals the dirt, but it cannot wash your face. Similarly, the Law reveals our sin (Romans 3:20), but only Jesus can cleanse us.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: "Transgression" means crossing a boundary. God set the boundary of the Law for our protection; crossing it puts us in the territory of sin.

Slide 13 Question: Is repentance merely being sorry for getting caught?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure sitting in shadows with head in hands, portraying deep contemplation and sorrow.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter weeping bitterly after the rooster crowed, depicting true godly sorrow.

---

Slide 15 Progressive Disclosure: True repentance involves:
• Acknowledging the sin
• Feeling "godly sorrow" (sorrow for breaking God's heart)
• Turning away from the sin
• Seeking God's mercy

---

Slide 16 Historical Note: The Law provides the "knowledge of sin" (conviction), while the Gospel provides the remedy. As Paul noted, he would not have known lust was wrong unless the Law said, "Thou shalt not covet."

[SN] The early Advent believers emphasized that the Law and the Gospel must go together.

Slide 17 Question: Once we repent, how are we cleansed?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a basin of water and a linen towel, symbolizing cleansing and service.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “If we walk in the light, as He is in the light... the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin... He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins...” (1 John 1:7-9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beam of pure, warm light breaking through clouds and illuminating a person in prayer.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: We cannot cleanse ourselves. When we confess, we depend entirely on the merits of Jesus. His death pays the penalty for our past, and His life provides power for our present.

---

Slide 20 Question: What happens to the "old life" of sin?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a withered tree branch lying on the ground, with fresh green shoots rising nearby.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him... Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death... even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:6, 4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a baptism taking place in a river, the water disturbed by the movement of immersion.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Paul uses the imagery of death and burial. The "old man" (habits of sin) is considered dead. Baptism acts as the public funeral of the old life and the resurrection of the new believer.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an empty tomb with the stone rolled away, symbolizing resurrection and new life.

---

Slide 23 Did You Know: The word "baptize" comes from the Greek *baptizo*, meaning to dip or immerse completely. A handful of water cannot represent a grave; only full immersion symbolizes being buried with Christ.

---

Slide 24 Question: What is the result of this "new creation"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter shaping a new vessel on a wheel, discarding the clay of a broken pot.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “But now ye also put off all these: anger, wrath, malice... Put on therefore... bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering.” (Colossians 3:8, 12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person changing garments, setting aside dark, tattered rags and putting on a clean, bright white robe.

---

Slide 26 Deeper Insight: Conversion changes a person's nature. It is a miracle. A converted person receives a new heart that loves doing good things, exchanging "anger and malice" for "kindness and meekness."

---

Slide 27 Practical Application: Since we are "risen with Christ," our focus shifts:
• Not on earthly, temporary things.
• But on "things above," where Christ is.
By setting our affection on heaven, our earthly conduct is transformed.
