Study Title: The Gift of True Repentance

Question: Who is called to repentance?

Biblical Answer: “I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.” (Luke 5:32)

Explanation: Jesus clarifies that His mission is a rescue mission. Just as a doctor cannot heal a patient who refuses to admit they are sick, the Savior calls those who recognize their need. This call is universal, extending to “all nations” (Luke 24:47).

[DYK] The Greek word for repentance is *metanoia*, which literally means "a change of mind." It is not merely an emotion, but a fundamental shift in how one views God, self, and sin.

Question: How does a person realize they need to repent?

Biblical Answer: “By the law is the knowledge of sin.” (Romans 3:20)

Explanation: The Law of God (the Ten Commandments) functions like a mirror. A mirror reveals dirt on the face, but it cannot wash it off. The Law reveals our moral condition and our need for a Savior, while the Holy Spirit presses this conviction upon the heart (John 16:8).

[ILL] Imagine driving down a road without speed limit signs; you wouldn't know if you were speeding. The signs (the Law) reveal the standard, showing us where we have strayed so we can seek the right path.

Question: What is the difference between "godly sorrow" and "worldly sorrow"?

Biblical Answer: “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)

Explanation: There is a vital difference between being sorry for the sin and being sorry for the consequences.
*   **Worldly sorrow** regrets getting caught or suffering a loss of reputation.
*   **Godly sorrow** breaks the heart because the sin has grieved a loving God. This genuine sorrow leads to a change in behavior.

Term Definition: “Contrite” (Isaiah 66:2) describes a spirit that is crushed or bruised by the weight of its own guilt, yet relies entirely on God’s mercy. God is drawn to this humility.

Question: What is the relationship between repentance and faith?

Biblical Answer: “Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21)

Explanation: We exercise repentance toward God because it is His law we have broken. We exercise faith toward Jesus Christ because He is the one who paid the penalty. We do not wait until we have fully repented to come to Jesus; rather, it is looking at Jesus—His love and His sacrifice—that melts the heart and makes true repentance possible.

[SN] Early Adventist pioneers emphasized that Law and Grace are not enemies. The Law points out the debt (sin), and Christ pays it. As the source text notes, “It is when the sinner, with the eye of faith, views Jesus... that his heart is touched.” We cannot manufacture repentance on our own; it is a gift received by beholding the Lamb of God.

Question: What is the result of true repentance?

Biblical Answer: “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.” (Matthew 3:8)

Explanation: True repentance is not just an internal feeling; it produces external evidence. A "new heart" (Ezekiel 18:31) leads to a new life. We do not continue in sin so that grace may abound (Romans 6:1-2); instead, the changed heart naturally produces "fruit"—actions that align with God's will.

[DYK] In the margin of some Bibles, the phrase "fruits meet for repentance" is rendered as "answerable to amendment of life." It means your lifestyle answers (corresponds to) your confession.

Question: What is the promise if we confess our sins?

Biblical Answer: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)

Explanation: This is the assurance of the Gospel. God is "faithful" (He keeps His promise) and "just" (Christ has already paid the price, so God will not demand payment from us twice). The blood of Jesus cleanses us from *all* sin.

Practical Application: True repentance is a doorway to freedom, not a punishment.
*   **Reflect**: Is there a "burden" of guilt you are carrying?
*   **Check**: Is your sorrow based on fear of punishment (worldly) or love for God (godly)?
*   **Act**: Bring the sin to God in confession, and accept the cleansing promise of 1 John 1:9 immediately.
