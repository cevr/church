Study Title: Unveiling the First Beast of Revelation 13

Question: How does the Bible describe the "beast" that rises out of the sea?

Biblical Answer: "And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." (Revelation 13:2)

Explanation: This symbol is a composite. In the book of Daniel (chapter 7), a lion represented Babylon, a bear represented Medo-Persia, and a leopard represented Greece. The beast in Revelation combines all these characteristics. This suggests a power that absorbed the territories and traits of those previous empires—specifically the Roman power, and subsequently the Papacy (the church-state system of Rome).

[DYK] In Bible prophecy, a "beast" usually represents a kingdom, nation, or political power (see Daniel 7:17). When a beast has religious characteristics, it represents a union of church and state.

Question: Did the Bible predict that this power would arise from within the church or from outside it?

Biblical Answer: “Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.” (2 Thessalonians 2:3)

Explanation: The Apostle Paul warned of a "falling away"—an internal spiritual decline or apostasy—that would pave the way for the "man of sin." The Papacy did not arise as an outside enemy but developed as the church began to compromise its original purity.

Term Definition: "Falling Away" (Greek: *apostasia*) means a defection or revolt. In a religious context, it means abandoning the original truths of Scripture.

Question: What was the first tangible sign of this "falling away" in history?

Biblical Answer: [Historical Evidence] The adoption of heathen (pagan) rites and customs into Christian worship.

Explanation: To make it easier for pagans to convert to Christianity, early church leaders adopted pagan ceremonies and gave them Christian names. Historians note that they labeled these rituals "mysteries" to sound more like the heathen religions the people were used to.

[ILL] Imagine taking a bottle labeled "Poison," dumping it out, filling it with water, but leaving the old label on it—or conversely, putting a "Water" label on a bottle of poison. The early church began mixing the "water" of the Gospel with the "poison" of pagan tradition, creating a confusing mixture.

Question: What political change solidified the power of this system?

Biblical Answer: [Historical Context] The union of Church and State, beginning largely under Emperor Constantine (312–337 A.D.).

Explanation: Bishops became worldly and sought the power of the state to enforce their decrees. This was the "theocratical theory"—the idea that the church should use the government to administer God's will.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This union is dangerous because the tools of the State are force and the sword, while the tools of the Church are supposed to be love and the Word. When the Church picks up the sword, it ceases to represent Christ.

Question: How did this union affect the laws of God, specifically regarding time and worship?

Biblical Answer: [Historical Evidence] It led to the enforcement of Sunday observance and the setting aside of the biblical Sabbath.

Explanation: The Council of Nicaea (325 A.D.) and later the Council of Laodicea (364 A.D.) made decrees separating Christians from Jewish customs. Constantine urged the church to have "nothing in common with the Jews." Consequently, the solemnity of the Sabbath was transferred to Sunday (the "venerable day of the sun"), and eventually, state laws were used to enforce rest on that day.

[DYK] In 401 A.D., church leaders petitioned the emperor to ban public shows on Sunday, not because the Bible commanded it, but because the theaters were more popular than the churches! They used the law to force attendance and "devotion."

Question: What is the ultimate result when the church uses state power to force religion?

Biblical Answer: “...who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God... showing himself that he is God.” (2 Thessalonians 2:4)

Explanation: When the church uses force to compel the conscience, it takes the place of God. Augustine, a church father, theorized that while it is better to lead men by instruction, it is sometimes necessary to use the "rod of temporal suffering." This philosophy planted the seeds for the Inquisition and religious persecution.

Deeper Insight: True worship must be voluntary. The "Beast" represents a system of coerced worship. God, however, seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth (John 4:24), drawn by love, not driven by fear.

Practical Application: We must guard our own hearts against "falling away."
• Do we rely on political power to solve spiritual problems?
• Do we value tradition over the plain Word of God?
• Are we following the "crowd" or the Bible?
God calls us to stand on His Word alone, separate from the world's compromises.
