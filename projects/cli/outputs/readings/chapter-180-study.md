Study Title: The Conflict Ended: From Creation to Restoration

Question: How does the Bible describe the completion of God’s original creation?

Biblical Answer: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made." (Genesis 2:1, 2)

Explanation: God’s original design was flawless. Everything was declared "very good" (Genesis 1:31). This was the first "finished" work of God—a perfect world designed for humanity’s happiness. Had sin not entered, this state of perfection would have continued forever.

[DYK] The word "finished" implies perfection and completeness. In Hebrew, the connection between "finished" and the "seventh day" (Sabbath) highlights that the Sabbath is a memorial of a perfect, finished creation.

Question: When Jesus was dying on the cross to save humanity from sin, what were His final words?

Biblical Answer: "When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished: and He bowed his head, and gave up the ghost." (John 19:30)

Explanation: This is the second great milestone in history. While Creation was finished by power, Redemption was finished by love and sacrifice. Jesus paid the complete price for sin. The plan to save humanity was secured at that moment.

[ILL] Imagine a massive debt that you could never pay, threatening you with prison. Then, a benefactor steps in and pays the entire sum, stamping the invoice "Paid in Full." Jesus' cry of "It is finished" was the stamp on our debt of sin.

Question: Moving forward to the end of time, what announcement is made when the final judgments (the seven plagues) are poured out?

Biblical Answer: "And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done." (Revelation 16:17)

Explanation: This marks the close of human probation. The opportunity to choose sides in the conflict between good and evil has ended. God is about to intervene to rescue His people and stop the reign of sin.

Term Definition: **Probation**: A period of testing or trial. In a biblical context, it is the time given to humanity to choose between God’s government of love and the rebellion of sin.

Question: When the New Jerusalem descends and God restores the earth, what final declaration does He make?

Biblical Answer: "And He that sat upon the throne said, Behold I make all things new... And He said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end." (Revelation 21:5, 6)

Explanation: The conflict is entirely over. Creation is restored. We see a beautiful progression in Scripture:
1. Creation finished.
2. Redemption finished.
3. The reign of Sin finished.
4. The Restoration finished.

[SN] Note the symmetry in Scripture regarding the phrase "It is done" or "It is finished." It appears at the three most critical junctures of history: The Cross (the price paid), The Close of Probation (the mediation ended), and The New Earth (the restoration complete). The Great Controversy between Christ and Satan moves from a battleground to a settled peace.

Question: What painful experiences will be permanently removed in the New Earth?

Biblical Answer: "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." (Revelation 21:4; see also Revelation 22:3)

Explanation: The "former things" refers to the results of sin. Death, the "last enemy," is destroyed. The curse that affected the ground and humanity is lifted.

Question: How does the Bible describe the peace within the animal kingdom and nature in this new world?

Biblical Answer: "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb... and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them... They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain..." (Isaiah 11:6-9)

Explanation: The harmony of Eden is restored. There is no predation, fear, or violence—even among animals.

[ILL] We are used to seeing wild animals behind bars in zoos for our safety or theirs. In the New Earth, there are no cages because there is no violence. A small child can lead a lion because the law of love pervades all creation.

Question: What is the ultimate privilege for the redeemed in the New Earth?

Biblical Answer: "And they shall see His face... He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." (Revelation 22:4; 21:3)

Explanation: This is the climax of the Gospel. Sin separated humanity from God (Isaiah 59:2), but the eradication of sin restores face-to-face communion.

[SN] In Genesis, after sin, Adam and Eve hid from the presence of the Lord. In Revelation, after restoration, the redeemed "see His face." The entire Bible is the story of how God brings His children back from hiding into His embrace.

Question: How long will God’s people enjoy this kingdom?

Biblical Answer: "But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever." (Daniel 7:18)

Explanation: The conflict is ended, not for a season, but for eternity. The security of the redeemed is everlasting.

Practical Application: Since we know that God has a plan to finish the work of redemption and restore all things, how does this affect our hope today? We can endure temporary trials knowing that:
1. The price for our salvation is already paid ("It is finished").
2. The suffering of this world has a definite end date ("It is done").
3. Our future is secure with Him forever.
