Study Title: Our Lord's Great Prophecy: Signs of His Return

Question: What specific promise did Jesus make about His return?

Biblical Answer: “In My Father's house are many mansions... I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am there ye may be also.” (John 14:2, 3)

Explanation: This is the foundation of Christian hope. Jesus is not merely leaving; He is engaged in preparation. The promise is personal ("receive you unto Myself") and physical—He intends for His people to be physically present with Him.

[SN] The imagery here is drawn from ancient Jewish wedding customs. The groom would go to his father's house to build an addition (a bridal chamber). Only when the father said the room was ready could the groom return to claim his bride.

Question: When the disciples asked for signs of His coming, what did Jesus warn would happen first?

Biblical Answer: “And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled... For nation shall rise against nation... and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places. All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matthew 24:6-8)

Explanation: Before the end, the world will experience social and natural turmoil. Jesus calls these "the beginning of sorrows" (literally "birth pangs"), implying they will increase in frequency and intensity as the event draws near.

Question: To what extent must the Gospel be shared before the end?

Biblical Answer: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14)

[DYK] In the 19th century, believers saw the rapid exploration of Africa and remote regions as a fulfillment of this sign. Today, technology and translation allow the Gospel to reach areas previously inaccessible.

Question: Jesus spoke of a "great tribulation." How long was the little horn (religious-political power) prophesied to persecute the saints?

Biblical Answer: “And they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” (Daniel 7:25)

Explanation: This time period is also described in Revelation 12:6 as "a thousand two hundred and threescore days" (1,260 days).

Term Definition: **Symbolic Prophecy**. In biblical prophecy, a "day" represents a literal "year" (Ezekiel 4:6). Therefore, this period represents 1,260 literal years of domination.

[SN] Historical context: This period aligns with the supremacy of the Papal power in Europe. It began with the decree of Justinian (538 A.D.) and ended when the Pope was taken captive by Berthier of France in 1798 A.D. The "shortening of the days" mentioned in Matthew 24:22 refers to the Protestant Reformation, which ended the active persecution before the prophetic period technically expired.

Question: What celestial signs did Jesus say would occur immediately after that tribulation period?

Biblical Answer: “Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven...” (Matthew 24:29)

Explanation: These signs were predicted to happen after the persecution eased (mid-18th century) but before the final end. Students of prophecy identify these specific historical fulfillments:
1.  **The Dark Day:** May 19, 1780. An unexplained darkness covered New England; the moon appeared as blood the following night.
2.  **The Falling Stars:** November 13, 1833. The greatest meteor shower in recorded history occurred, fulfilling the sign of stars falling "as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs" (Rev 6:13).

[ILL] Just as road signs tell you a destination is near before you can actually see the city skyline, these historical events serve as markers that we have entered the "time of the end."

Question: How can we know when the Lord is about to appear?

Biblical Answer: “Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.” (Matthew 24:32, 33)

Explanation: We may not know the exact day or hour (Matthew 24:36), but we are commanded to know the *season*. When trees bud, summer is inevitable. When these signs appear, Christ’s coming is inevitable.

Question: What is the danger of thinking Christ will delay His return?

Biblical Answer: “But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming... The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him... and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites.” (Matthew 24:48-51)

Deeper Insight: The "evil servant" is not an atheist; he calls Him "My lord." The danger is not denying Christ, but losing the sense of urgency and slipping into worldly living (eating, drinking, and smiting fellow servants).

Practical Application: How do we prepare?
*   **Watch:** Pay attention to the signs in the world and the Word.
*   **Work:** Engage in the Gospel commission (Matt 24:14).
*   **Wait:** Maintain an attitude of expectancy.

We are living in the generation that looks back on the fulfilled signs. The next major event in prophetic history is the appearance of the Lord. Are you ready for Him today?
