Study Title: The Promised One: The Birth and Early Life of Jesus

---

Slide 1 Question: Where does the Bible first promise a Savior from sin?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God said unto the serpent,... I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:14, 15)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: This prophecy, spoken in Eden immediately after the Fall, outlines the "Great Controversy" between good and evil. It promises that a descendant ("seed") of the woman would eventually crush the head of the serpent (Satan), though the Savior would suffer a wound to His "heel" in the process.

[SN] This verse is often called the *Protoevangelium* (the first gospel). Even in judgment, God’s first move was to promise a Rescue.

Slide 4 Term Definition: **Enmity**

Refers to deep-seated hatred or hostility. In this context, it is a supernatural hostility God places between His people and the forces of darkness to prevent humanity from being totally comfortable in sin.

Slide 5 Question: Who is this promised "Seed"?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” (Galatians 3:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus Christ standing with a gentle demeanor, surrounded by a soft, divine aura.

Slide 7 Question: Where did prophecy predict the Christ would be born?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a map or scroll depicting the ancient lands of Judea, with a focus on a small village.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea.” (Matthew 2:5, referencing Micah 5:2)

[DYK] Bethlehem means "House of Bread." It is fitting that Jesus, who later called Himself the "Bread of Life," was born in a town associated with sustenance.

Slide 9 Question: What was the nature of His birth and His identity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a young Mary looking downward in contemplation, bathed in soft angelic light.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14)

Also: “For unto us a child is born... and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the nativity scene, focusing on the infant Jesus radiating a soft, holy glow.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: These verses reveal the dual nature of Christ. He is born of a woman (human), yet He is "The mighty God" and "Immanuel," which translates to "God with us."

Slide 12 Question: Why was He named "Jesus"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an angel speaking to Joseph in a dream, soft ethereal light.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:21)

[ILL] A lifeguard does not merely teach a drowning person how to swim; they dive in to rescue them. Similarly, the name Jesus (Yeshua) means "The Lord Saves." He came not just to teach, but to save us from the condition of sin.

Slide 14 Question: How was the news of His birth received by heaven and earth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the night sky filled with angels looking down upon the earth.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer:
*   **The Angels:** “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” (Luke 2:14)
*   **Simeon:** “Mine eyes have seen thy salvation... a light to lighten the Gentiles.” (Luke 2:30-32)
*   **The Wise Men:** “They saw the young child... and fell down, and worshipped Him.” (Matthew 2:11)

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Notice the diversity of witnesses. Shepherds (the working poor), Simeon and Anna (the faithful elderly), and Wise Men (Gentile intellectuals) all recognized Him. The Gospel is accessible to every class and background.

Slide 16 Question: Did everyone welcome the new King?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King Herod sitting on a throne in shadows, looking troubled and angry.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Herod... slew all the children that were in Bethlehem... from two years old and under.” (Matthew 2:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark, stormy night in a village, representing sorrow and tragedy, historically respectful but somber.

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: Behind the political jealousy of King Herod was a spiritual force. Revelation describes this as the "dragon" standing before the woman "to devour her child as soon as it was born" (Revelation 12:4). The enemy of souls tried to destroy Jesus in His infancy to prevent the plan of salvation.

[DYK] This event led to the "Flight into Egypt." Just as Israel was called out of Egypt in the Old Testament, Jesus (the new Israel) was called out of Egypt (Matthew 2:15), fulfilling the pattern of deliverance.

Slide 19 Question: What do we know about the childhood and youth of Jesus?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a young boy helping in a carpentry shop, soft sunlight filtering through dust motes.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40)

Explanation: Jesus did not bypass human development. He grew physically ("stature"), mentally ("wisdom"), and spiritually ("favor with God").

Slide 21 Question: When did Jesus first show an understanding of His specific mission?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the interior of the Temple in Jerusalem, grand pillars and soft light.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.” (Luke 2:47)

Explanation: At age twelve, during the Passover in Jerusalem, Jesus was found in the temple discussing theology with the teachers. He was not merely listening; He was asking questions that revealed deep spiritual insight.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a twelve-year-old boy standing calmly among older, bearded scholars in the Temple.

---

Slide 23 Illustration: Most children at twelve are focused on play or learning a trade. Jesus was focused on "His Father's business." His questions to the rabbis likely gently pointed them back to the true meaning of the prophecies concerning Himself.

Slide 24 Question: How did Jesus treat His earthly parents despite His divine wisdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Mary and Joseph looking relieved and embracing their son.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.” (Luke 2:51)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family walking together down a hill towards a village, signifying unity and submission.

---

Slide 26 Practical Application:

1.  **Salvation:** Have we accepted the "Seed" who crushed the serpent's head for us?
2.  **Growth:** Like Jesus, are we growing in wisdom and favor with God today?
3.  **Submission:** If the "Mighty God" was willing to be subject to human parents, can we learn humility in our own relationships?
