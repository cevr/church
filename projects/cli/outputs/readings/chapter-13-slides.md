Study Title: Christ the Way of Life

Slide 1 Question: What is the natural spiritual condition of all humanity?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)

“But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin.” (Galatians 3:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient balance scale, one side weighed down heavily, the other empty, symbolizing falling short of the standard.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible presents a universal diagnosis: everyone has missed the mark. To "come short" implies an inability to reach God's standard of perfection on our own. We are naturally "concluded" (shut up or imprisoned) under the power of sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking up at a massive, insurmountable stone wall, depicting the inability to reach God on one's own.

---

Slide 4 Illustration: Imagine an archer trying to hit a target that is miles away. Whether the arrow lands ten feet away or a thousand feet away, everyone falls short of the target. Similarly, human effort cannot bridge the gap to God’s glory.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an archer in a field releasing an arrow toward a target that is impossibly far on the horizon.

---

Slide 5 Question: What is the result of sin, and what is God’s remedy?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a hand offering a handful of dark coins, contrasted with another hand offering a glowing, pure white light.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Sin acts like an employer that pays a salary: death. In contrast, eternal life is not a wage we earn, but a "gift" we receive. You cannot work for a gift; you can only accept it with gratitude.

[DYK] The Greek word for "wages" (*opsonion*) was often used for a soldier's stipend or ration money. It represents exactly what one has earned and deserves.

Slide 8 Question: Where is this eternal life found?

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.” (1 John 5:11-12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus Christ standing with open arms, a gentle halo of light illuminating the space around Him.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Eternal life is not just a future destination or a philosophical concept; it is a Person. Possessing life means possessing Christ. If you have Him, you have the life immediately.

**Term Definition:** “Record” refers to legal testimony or witness evidence. God has gone on record that life is found exclusively in Jesus.

Slide 11 Question: How does this new life transform the believer?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person sitting in quiet contemplation, a soft light seeming to glow from within their chest.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God.” (Galatians 2:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul writing an epistle, looking upward with an expression of deep peace and inspiration.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The Christian life is a substitution. We lay down our old life, and Christ lives His life through us. We do not live by our own power, but by faith in His power.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This verse highlights the "mystical union" between the believer and Christ. It is not merely imitating Jesus from the outside, but allowing His Spirit to animate our choices, thoughts, and actions from the inside.

Slide 14 Question: Was this plan of salvation an afterthought?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the cosmos being formed, with a divine light piercing through the darkness of space.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “...the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8)

“And I will put enmity between thee [the serpent] and the woman... it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lamb standing peacefully in a garden setting, with a subtle foreshadowing of a cross in the background.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Before sin ever entered, God had a plan. The "Seed" (Christ) was promised to Adam and Eve immediately after the fall. This prophecy predicted that while Satan would wound Christ (bruise His heel at the cross), Christ would ultimately destroy sin and Satan (crush the head).

[DYK] Genesis 3:15 is often called the *Protoevangelium*, or "First Gospel." It is the very first promise of a Savior found in the Bible.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve in the Garden, listening to a beam of light from above, with a serpent retreating into the shadows.

---

Slide 17 Question: How closely did Christ identify with humanity to save us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking through a dusty village market, blending in with the crowd, looking weary yet compassionate.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same...” (Hebrews 2:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the nativity scene or Jesus working in a carpenter shop, emphasizing His physical humanity.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: To be a complete Savior, Christ had to meet us exactly where we are. He partook of our nature—inheriting the same physical liabilities and temptations common to the children of Adam—yet He remained sinless through reliance on the Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in the wilderness, looking tired and hungry, yet steadfast in prayer.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: By taking on our nature, Christ demonstrated that humanity, when connected to God, can overcome. He did not overcome using powers unavailable to us; He overcame as a man trusting in God, setting a pattern for our own victory over sin.

[SN] The pioneer perspective emphasizes that if Christ had a "super-human" nature different from ours, He could not fully be our Example. Because He fought the battle in our flesh, He can sympathize with our struggles and offer real help (Hebrews 4:15).

Slide 21 Question: How do we become children of God and heirs to this promise?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father placing a robe around the shoulders of a kneeling son.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people, men and women of different ages, looking upward with faces full of hope and belonging.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: We are not born as children of God in the spiritual sense; we are adopted into the family through faith.

[ILL] A legal heir receives an inheritance not because they worked for it, but because of their relationship to the father. By faith, we become "joint-heirs" with Christ.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a signet ring being placed on a finger, symbolizing authority and inheritance.

Slide 24 Practical Application:
Since Christ is the "Way of Life," consider these steps for today:
• **Admit:** Acknowledge that "coming short" is our natural state.
• **Accept:** Receive the gift of life by inviting Christ to live in you (Gal 2:20).
• **Trust:** Believe that just as Christ overcame in human flesh, He can give you victory over your specific struggles today.
