Study Title: Divine Healing and the Prayer of Faith

Question: Is there a relationship between obedience to God and physical health?

Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, ...and the Lord will take away from thee all sickness.” (Deuteronomy 7:11, 15)

Explanation: The Scriptures present God not only as our Creator but as the Sustainer of life. The text suggests that living in harmony with God's laws (both moral and natural) places a person in the best position to receive God's blessing of health.

[DYK] The sanitary laws given to Moses regarding diet, hygiene, and quarantine were thousands of years ahead of their time. While other nations used remedies that often caused more harm than good, God’s instructions protected Israel from many preventable diseases.

Question: How deeply did Jesus care about physical suffering?

Biblical Answer: “Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.” (Matthew 8:17)

Explanation: Jesus did not view physical suffering with indifference. He “took” them upon Himself, showing that the Gospel involves the restoration of the whole person—body, mind, and spirit.

[ILL] Imagine a doctor who doesn't just write a prescription but stays by the bedside, sharing the burden of the pain. This is the picture Matthew paints of Christ—He felt the weight of humanity's suffering.

Question: How should the church pray for the sick today?

Biblical Answer: “Is there any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up.” (James 5:14-15)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Community:** It is not a solitary act; the leaders ("elders") are called.
2.  **Symbolism:** Oil is used, representing the Holy Spirit and consecration.
3.  **Source of Power:** It is done "in the name of the Lord," not by the power of the individual praying.

Term Definition: “Anointing” was a common practice in biblical times, often associated with setting something apart for holy use or for medicinal purposes. Here, it signifies committing the sick person entirely to God's care.

[SN] A note on King Asa (2 Chronicles 16:12): The text mentions Asa sought "not to the Lord, but to the physicians." Early Adventist pioneers understood this not as a prohibition against medicine, but as a warning against trusting *only* in human aid while neglecting the Great Physician. True healing combines the best of wisdom (remedies) with the power of prayer.

Question: What spiritual preparation is necessary when asking for healing?

Biblical Answer: “Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed.” (James 5:16)

Explanation: Physical healing and spiritual forgiveness are closely linked in Scripture. Before asking for a physical miracle, we are called to examine our hearts, confess known sins, and clear the channel between us and God.

Deeper Insight: The text implies that unconfessed sin or a "willful course" of disobedience can hinder the work of healing. If a person prays for health only to return to the habits that destroyed their health, God cannot consistently answer that prayer.

Question: Why are some prayers for healing not answered immediately?

Biblical Answer: “Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.” (James 4:3)

Explanation: God looks at the motive. Additionally, Jesus pointed to "unbelief" (Matthew 17:20) as a hindrance. However, the deepest answer lies in submission to God’s superior wisdom. As Christ prayed in Gethsemane, true faith always adds, "Nevertheless not my will, but Thine, be done."

[ILL] A child may ask for a sharp knife, thinking it a toy. A loving parent refuses the request to protect the child. Similarly, God answers prayers according to what is best for our eternal good, which we cannot always see in the moment.

Practical Application:
*   **Align:** Are my lifestyle habits in harmony with God's laws of health?
*   **Confess:** Is there unconfessed sin or bitterness blocking my spiritual connection?
*   **Trust:** Am I willing to trust God's answer, whether it be immediate healing or grace to endure?

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The ultimate healing is found in the "redemption of our body" (Romans 8:23) at the resurrection. While God heals many now as a sign of His kingdom, the final eradication of all sickness awaits the New Earth, where "the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick" (Isaiah 33:24).
