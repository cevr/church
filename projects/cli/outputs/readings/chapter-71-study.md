Study Title: The Law Given at Sinai

Question: How does Scripture describe the character of the laws God gave at Sinai?

Biblical Answer: “Thou... spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments: and madest known unto them Thy holy Sabbath...” (Nehemiah 9:13-14)

Explanation: The Bible describes God's law not as a burden, but as "true," "good," and "right." These laws were given to reveal the character of God to His people. Note that the Sabbath is highlighted specifically as something "made known" to them, indicating its special significance.

[DYK] The mountain of Sinai is generally identified with *Jebel Musa* (Mountain of Moses) in the Sinai Peninsula. It rises over 7,000 feet. The giving of the law was accompanied by thunder, lightning, and smoke, signifying the awesome majesty and holiness of the Lawgiver.

Question: Did the Ten Commandments and the Sabbath exist before they were written on stone at Sinai?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep My commandments and My laws?” (Exodus 16:28); also “...I do make them know the statutes of God, and His laws.” (Exodus 18:16)

Progressive Disclosure:
*   **Before Sinai:** In Exodus 16, weeks before reaching the mountain, God tested Israel regarding the manna and the Sabbath.
*   **The Conclusion:** God could not accuse them of breaking a law that did not exist. Therefore, the principles of the Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath, were known by God's people before the formal codification at Sinai.

[ILL] Imagine a country formalizing its constitution. The principles of right and wrong (like "do not murder") existed in the conscience of the people long before they were written down on parchment. Similarly, God's moral law existed from the beginning, but at Sinai, it was formally documented for a nation that had lost sight of it during slavery.

Question: How did God distinguish the Moral Law (Ten Commandments) from the other ceremonial and civil laws?

Biblical Answer:
1.  **The Moral Law:** “He gave unto Moses... two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.” (Exodus 31:18)
2.  **The Other Laws:** “Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished.” (Deuteronomy 31:24)

Term Definition: "Finger of God" represents the direct power and personal authorship of the Creator. While Moses wrote the civil statutes and ceremonial instructions in a book (scroll), God Himself inscribed the Ten Commandments on durable stone.

Deeper Insight: The use of stone symbolizes permanence and immutability. The ceremonial laws (regarding sacrifices and the temple) pointed forward to Jesus and ended at the Cross (Colossians 2:14). However, the Moral Law on stone remains the standard of righteousness for all time.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Ark of the Covenant contained the tables of stone *inside* it, covered by the Mercy Seat. This illustrates the foundation of God's government: Justice (the Law) and Mercy (Atonement) meet together. The Law demands righteousness; the Mercy Seat provides forgiveness through Christ.

Question: Is the Law given at Sinai relevant to Christians today?

Biblical Answer: “Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill... So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” (James 2:10-12)

Explanation: The New Testament writer James refers directly to the Ten Commandments (adultery, killing) and calls them the "law of liberty." This confirms that the code given at Sinai is the standard of judgment for the Christian believer.

[ILL] A mirror shows us the dirt on our face, but it cannot wash it off. In the same way, the Law reveals our sin (Romans 3:20), but it cannot save us. We need the water—the cleansing blood of Jesus—to wash us. We do not break the mirror because it shows us our defects; we thank it for showing us our need for cleansing.

Question: What is the penalty for breaking this law, and what is the hope for the sinner?

Biblical Answer: “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

Explanation: The broken law demands the death of the sinner. God, who is "longsuffering... and by no means clearing the guilty" (Numbers 14:18), must deal with sin. However, the "gift of God" is that Jesus took that penalty upon Himself.

Practical Application:
*   **Guidance:** We use the Law to know God's will for a happy life.
*   **Conviction:** We allow the Law to show us our need for a Savior.
*   **Gratitude:** We obey not to *earn* salvation, but because we have *received* salvation.

Summary: The Law was spoken by God, written on stone, and placed in the Ark. It is the eternal transcript of His character. While the wages of sin is death, the gift of God is life through Jesus, who empowers us to keep His commandments in love.
