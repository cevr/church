Study Title: The Gift of Self-Control (Temperance)

Question: How does the Bible classify temperance (self-control)?

Biblical Answer: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.” (Galatians 5:22, 23)

Explanation: Temperance is not merely human willpower; it is a result of the Holy Spirit working within a person. It is listed as the crowning fruit of the Spirit, essential for a balanced Christian life.

Term Definition: “Temperance” (Greek: *egkrateia*) means “inner strength” or “mastery.” In the historic Adventist understanding, it is defined as distinct abstinence from things that are harmful and the moderate use of things that are good.

[ILL] Imagine a powerful river. Without a dam or banks, it causes a flood and destruction. With a dam (control), that same water generates power and brings life. Temperance is the bank that directs the flow of our life for good.

Question: Why is self-control necessary for the Christian life?

Biblical Answer: “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things... I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.” (1 Corinthians 9:25, 27)

Explanation: Paul uses the metaphor of an athlete. Just as a runner trains their body to win a race, a Christian must bring their physical desires under the control of their spiritual mind to succeed in the race of faith.

Question: What are the practical dangers of intemperance, specifically regarding alcohol?

Biblical Answer: “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine...” (Proverbs 23:29, 30)

Progressive Disclosure: • Emotional distress (woe/sorrow) • Relational conflict (contentions) • Physical harm (wounds) • Loss of mental clarity (babbling)

[DYK] The Bible often links physical health with spiritual health. The “redness of eyes” mentioned in Proverbs indicates a physical inflammation caused by alcohol, signaling that the body is being poisoned.

Question: Why does God strictly warn leaders (Kings and Priests) against intoxicating drink?

Biblical Answer: “It is not for kings to drink wine... lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment... Do not drink wine nor strong drink... when ye go into the tabernacle... that ye may put difference between holy and unholy.” (Proverbs 31:4, 5; Leviticus 10:8-10)

Explanation: Alcohol compromises the ability to think clearly and make moral distinctions. For the priest, it destroyed the ability to distinguish between the "holy" and the "common."

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: In the New Testament, believers are called a "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9). Therefore, the prohibition given to the sons of Aaron to abstain from wine so they could discern spiritual things applies spiritually to every believer today who wishes to serve God with a clear mind.

Question: What is the result when we choose to abstain from harmful substances?

Biblical Answer: “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank... And in all matters of wisdom and understanding... he found them ten times better than all the magicians...” (Daniel 1:8, 20)

Explanation: Daniel and his friends chose water and "pulse" (plant-based food) over the king's luxuries. The result was not only better physical health ("fairer and fatter") but significantly superior mental wisdom.

Question: Does the Bible speak of two different kinds of "wine"?

Biblical Answer: “Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster... destroy it not; for a blessing is in it...” (Isaiah 65:8 - *implied context from source note regarding unfermented wine*) vs. “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red... when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent...” (Proverbs 23:31, 32)

Explanation: Scripture distinguishes between the fresh, unfermented juice of the grape (a blessing) and fermented, alcoholic wine (a mocker).
• **Good Wine:** "Pure blood of the grape" (Deut 32:14).
• **Bad Wine:** Wine that "moveth itself aright" (Proverbs 23:31)—a description of the fermentation process where the liquid bubbles and moves upward.

[DYK] The ancients knew how to preserve grape juice without fermentation. They often boiled it down to a thick syrup or sealed it air-tight. When the Bible speaks of wine as a blessing, it refers to this nutritious fruit of the vine. When it speaks of it as a curse (causing woe), it refers to the fermented, intoxicating drink.

Question: How serious is the sin of drunkenness in the eyes of God?

Biblical Answer: “Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards... shall inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Corinthians 6:10)

Explanation: Intemperance is not just a bad habit; it is a spiritual barrier that prevents entrance into the Kingdom. It is often associated with other fleshly sins like strife and sedition (Galatians 5:19-21).

Practical Application: How can we practice temperance today?
• Ask God for the Fruit of the Spirit (self-control) daily.
• Abstain from substances that cloud the mind (alcohol, drugs).
• Practice moderation in good things (eating, working, recreation).
• Protect our "temple" so we can clearly discern God's will.

Deeper Insight: The ultimate goal of temperance is not just health, but holiness. By keeping the body in subjection, we ensure that our lower nature (flesh) does not dictate to our higher nature (mind/spirit), leaving us free to commune with God.
