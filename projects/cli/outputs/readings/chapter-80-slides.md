Study Title: The Eternal Gospel: Christ in the Old Testament

---

Slide 1 Question: What is the universal condition of humanity, and how does God offer the solution?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned... even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.” (Romans 5:12, 18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting a contrast: Adam turning away from Eden in shadow, and Christ extending a hand of grace in warm light.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible presents two representatives for the human race: Adam and Christ. Through Adam’s fall, sin became an inherited condition leading to death. Through Christ (the "Second Adam"), righteousness is offered as a free gift.

---

Slide 4 Illustration: Imagine a debt inherited by a family that no member can pay. Then, a benefactor steps in to pay the debt and credit the family’s account with his own wealth.

[ILL] Adam left us the debt of sin; Christ credits us with His righteousness.

Slide 5 Question: Is the method of salvation different in the Old Testament than in the New?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scroll lying next to a New Testament codex on a wooden table, both illuminated by the same candle.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12) ... “The just shall live by his faith.” (Habakkuk 2:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an Old Testament prophet looking upward in faith, bathed in the same golden light as a first-century disciple.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Salvation has never been earned by works. Whether in the time of Habakkuk or the Apostles, the method is identical: faith in the saving power of God.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple altar in a field, representing faith rather than complex ritual, soft pastoral lighting.

---

Slide 8 Did You Know? The verse “The just shall live by faith” appears three times in the New Testament (Romans, Galatians, Hebrews), but it originates from the Old Testament prophet Habakkuk.

[DYK] This demonstrates that the doctrine of righteousness by faith is the foundation of the entire Bible.

Slide 9 Question: Did the Patriarchs, like Abraham, understand the Gospel?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham standing under a starry night sky, looking upward with an expression of deep contemplation and hope.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And the Scripture... preached before the gospel unto Abraham... Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: and he saw it, and was glad.” (Galatians 3:8; John 8:56)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham building an altar, his face peaceful, anticipating a future promise.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The "Gospel" was not an invention of the New Testament era. It was preached to Abraham. When he offered sacrifices, he looked forward in faith to the Messiah, just as we look backward to the Cross.

Slide 12 Term Definition: Justification

**Justification**: The legal act where God declares a sinner "righteous" not because of their own deeds, but because they have accepted Christ's record. Abraham believed God, and it was "counted" to him as righteousness.

Slide 13 Question: Did Moses and the Israelites have a relationship with Christ?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses standing on a rocky outcrop, looking over the camp of Israel in the wilderness.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “By faith Moses... esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt... for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” (Hebrews 11:24-26; 1 Corinthians 10:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of water gushing from a large split rock in the desert, refreshing a thirsty multitude.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The Leader of Israel in the wilderness was Christ Himself. The "Rock" that provided water was a type (symbol) of Jesus, struck so that the water of life could flow to a thirsty world.

[SN] The "Angel of the Lord" in the burning bush and the pillar of cloud is understood by early Adventist pioneers to be the pre-incarnate Christ. Moses knew Him personally.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Pillar of Fire guiding the camp of Israel by night, majestic and protective.

---

Slide 16 Question: Who inspired the Old Testament prophets to write?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scribe or prophet sitting at a table, quill in hand, pausing to listen to a divine whisper.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.” (1 Peter 1:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Isaiah, dramatic lighting, holding a scroll that glows faintly with inner light.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The Holy Spirit who inspired Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Moses is specifically identified here as "the Spirit of Christ." The voice speaking in the Old Testament is the voice of Jesus.

[ILL] A ghostwriter pens a biography, but the ideas come from the subject. In the Bible, human hands held the pen, but the "Spirit of Christ" provided the thoughts.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a hand holding a quill pen, with a dove descending softly in the background representing the Spirit.

---

Slide 19 Question: How did Jesus use the Old Testament to teach His disciples?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking on a dirt road with two disciples, gesturing as He speaks.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting at a table in Emmaus, breaking bread, with the disciples realizing who He is.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: Jesus affirmed that Moses "wrote of Me" (John 5:46).

This validates the typology of the sacrificial system. Every lamb sacrificed, every high priest ordained, and every sanctuary service was a shadow cast by the reality of Jesus Christ.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest in the sanctuary, with the shadow of the High Priest forming the silhouette of Jesus.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application: Since Jesus is the "author and finisher of our faith," how should we read the Old Testament today?

• Look for Jesus in every story and symbol.
• Claim the promises given to Abraham.
• Rest assured that the plan of salvation is unchangeable.
