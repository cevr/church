Study Title: Christ the Way of Life

Question: What is the natural spiritual condition of all humanity?

Biblical Answer: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23) / “But the Scripture hath concluded all under sin.” (Galatians 3:22)

Explanation: The Bible presents a universal diagnosis: everyone has missed the mark. To "come short" implies an inability to reach God's standard of perfection on our own. We are naturally "concluded" (shut up or imprisoned) under the power of sin.

[ILL] Imagine an archer trying to hit a target that is miles away. Whether the arrow lands ten feet away or a thousand feet away, everyone falls short of the target. Similarly, human effort cannot bridge the gap to God’s glory.

Question: What is the result of sin, and what is God’s remedy?

Biblical Answer: “The wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

Explanation: Sin acts like an employer that pays a salary: death. In contrast, eternal life is not a wage we earn, but a "gift" we receive. You cannot work for a gift; you can only accept it with gratitude.

[DYK] The Greek word for "wages" (*opsonion*) was often used for a soldier's stipend or ration money. It represents exactly what one has earned and deserves.

Question: Where is this eternal life found?

Biblical Answer: “This is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.” (1 John 5:11-12)

Explanation: Eternal life is not just a future destination or a philosophical concept; it is a Person. Possessing life means possessing Christ. If you have Him, you have the life immediately.

Term Definition: “Record” refers to legal testimony or witness evidence. God has gone on record that life is found exclusively in Jesus.

Question: How does this new life transform the believer?

Biblical Answer: “I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God.” (Galatians 2:20)

Explanation: The Christian life is a substitution. We lay down our old life, and Christ lives His life through us. We do not live by our own power, but by faith in His power.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This verse highlights the "mystical union" between the believer and Christ. It is not merely imitating Jesus from the outside, but allowing His Spirit to animate our choices, thoughts, and actions from the inside.

Question: Was this plan of salvation an afterthought?

Biblical Answer: “...the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8) / “And I will put enmity between thee [the serpent] and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:15)

Explanation: Before sin ever entered, God had a plan. The "Seed" (Christ) was promised to Adam and Eve immediately after the fall. This prophecy predicted that while Satan would wound Christ (bruise His heel at the cross), Christ would ultimately destroy sin and Satan (crush the head).

[DYK] Genesis 3:15 is often called the *Protoevangelium*, or "First Gospel." It is the very first promise of a Savior found in the Bible.

Question: How closely did Christ identify with humanity to save us?

Biblical Answer: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same...” (Hebrews 2:14)

Explanation: To be a complete Savior, Christ had to meet us exactly where we are. He partook of our nature—inheriting the same physical liabilities and temptations common to the children of Adam—yet He remained sinless through reliance on the Spirit.

Deeper Insight: By taking on our nature, Christ demonstrated that humanity, when connected to God, can overcome. He did not overcome using powers unavailable to us; He overcame as a man trusting in God, setting a pattern for our own victory over sin.

[SN] Optional tangent on Christ's Nature: The pioneer perspective emphasizes that if Christ had a "super-human" nature different from ours, He could not fully be our Example. Because He fought the battle in our flesh, He can sympathize with our struggles and offer real help (Hebrews 4:15).

Question: How do we become children of God and heirs to this promise?

Biblical Answer: “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:26)

Explanation: We are not born as children of God in the spiritual sense; we are adopted into the family through faith.

[ILL] A legal heir receives an inheritance not because they worked for it, but because of their relationship to the father. By faith, we become "joint-heirs" with Christ, sharing in everything that belongs to Him.

Practical Application:
Since Christ is the "Way of Life," consider these steps for today:
• **Admit:** Acknowledge that "coming short" is our natural state.
• **Accept:** Receive the gift of life by inviting Christ to live in you (Gal 2:20).
• **Trust:** Believe that just as Christ overcame in human flesh, He can give you victory over your specific struggles today.
