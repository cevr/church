Study Title: The Atonement and the Heavenly Sanctuary

Question: At the moment of Christ's death, what miraculous event signaled that the earthly temple service was no longer necessary?

Biblical Answer: “Jesus, when He had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom." (Matthew 27:50, 51)

Explanation: The tearing of the heavy curtain (veil) that separated the Holy from the Most Holy place signified the end of the earthly sacrificial system. No longer would men need human priests to offer animal sacrifices; the true Lamb of God had died.

[DYK] The veil in the temple was thick and heavy. For it to tear "from the top to the bottom" implies it was not torn by human hands, but by the hand of God, signifying He was opening the way to His presence for all.

Question: If the earthly service is finished, where does Jesus carry out His work as our High Priest now?

Biblical Answer: “Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." (Hebrews 8:1)

Progressive Disclosure:
• **Who is the Minister?** Christ, a High Priest of "good things to come." (Heb 9:11)
• **Where is the Sanctuary?** It is the "true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man." (Heb 8:2)
• **Why not on earth?** "For if He were on earth, He should not be a priest..." (Heb 8:4). His ministry belongs to the heavenly reality, not the earthly shadow.

Term Definition: **"Shadow" vs. "Substance."** The text describes the earthly service as a "shadow of heavenly things" (Heb 8:5). A shadow gives a rough outline of the object casting it, but it is not the object itself. The earthly rituals were the outline; Christ's ministry in heaven is the reality.

[ILL] Think of an architect's model of a house. The model is useful to understand the design, but you cannot live in it. The earthly sanctuary was the model; the heavenly sanctuary is the true house where salvation is fully realized.

Question: Does the heavenly sanctuary have specific apartments and furniture like the earthly one did?

Biblical Answer: “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament." (Revelation 11:19)

Explanation: Just as the earthly sanctuary had a Most Holy Place containing the Ark of the Covenant (testament), the heavenly sanctuary contains the original Ark.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The presence of the Ark in heaven confirms that God’s Law (the Ten Commandments kept inside the Ark) is eternal and immutable. It rests beneath His throne as the foundation of His government, distinct from the ceremonial laws of sacrifice which ceased at the cross.

Question: The earthly sanctuary had to be cleansed once a year (on the Day of Atonement). Is it necessary for the heavenly sanctuary to be cleansed as well?

Biblical Answer: “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these." (Hebrews 9:23)

Explanation: The text states that just as the "patterns" (earthly) were purified with animal blood, the "heavenly things" must be purified by the blood of Christ. This points to a specific time of judgment and the final removal of sin from the record.

Deeper Insight: The Day of Atonement was a day of judgment. In the type (earthly service), it was the day sins were separated from the camp. In the antitype (heavenly service), Christ performs a final work to "put away sin" (Heb 9:26) before He returns.

Question: How does the Bible describe the final removal of these sins?

Biblical Answer: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord." (Acts 3:19)

Explanation: Sins are recorded until they are "blotted out." This blotting out precedes the return of Jesus (Acts 3:20).

Question: In the earthly service, the High Priest placed the sins on a "scapegoat." How is this fulfilled in the plan of salvation?

Biblical Answer: “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation." (Hebrews 9:28)

Explanation: Christ bore the penalty of our sins on the Cross. However, the narrative of the Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16:21) shows that after the priestly work is finished, the guilt/responsibility is placed on the head of the scapegoat (representing Satan), who is sent into a desolate land.

[ILL] Imagine a courtroom. The defendant is acquitted because a benefactor paid the fine. The record is cleared (blotted out). But the one who instigated the crime (the mastermind) must still bear the responsibility for causing the trouble. Christ pays our debt; Satan, the originator of evil, eventually bears the responsibility for the existence of sin.

Question: What decision is made regarding God's people before the resurrection occurs?

Biblical Answer: “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead...” (Luke 20:35)

Explanation: Before the dead are raised at Christ's coming, they must be "accounted worthy." This implies an investigation or judgment takes place prior to the Second Coming to determine who will be part of the "resurrection of the just."

Question: Is there a specific time prophecy related to this cleansing of the sanctuary?

Biblical Answer: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)

Note: The text clarifies that this vision belongs to "the time of the end" (Daniel 8:17), indicating this cleansing is a latter-day work of Christ in heaven.

Practical Application: Since we have a High Priest making intercession for us and a judgment that determines who is "accounted worthy," how should we live?
• **Confidence:** We can approach God knowing Jesus is our Representative.
• **Cleansing:** We should seek to have our sins "blotted out" through repentance now.
• **Hope:** We look forward to Him appearing "the second time without sin unto salvation."
