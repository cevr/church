**The Repairers of the Breach: A Study on Sabbath Reform**

Slide 2 Question: How does Jesus describe worship that replaces God's commandments with human traditions?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of religious leaders in discussion, with a focus on hand gestures and robes, set in a temple courtyard.

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single scroll open on a wooden table, contrasted with a pile of man-made parchments pushed to the side.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Jesus warns that sincerity alone is not enough; true worship must be grounded in truth. When human customs push aside explicit divine commands, worship becomes "vain" or empty.

[ILL] Imagine a soldier who salutes his general but refuses to follow his marching orders. The salute (worship) means little if the obedience (law) is missing.

Slide 5 Question: What is the destiny of religious institutions or doctrines not established by God?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.” (Matthew 15:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gardener’s hands gently but firmly pulling up a withered plant by the roots, soil falling away.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Jesus uses the metaphor of a garden. God planted the Sabbath in Eden (Genesis 2). Any institution planted later by human authority—such as the substitution of Sunday for Saturday—is a "plant" the Father did not plant and will eventually be removed.

Slide 8 Did You Know?
[DYK] The weekly cycle of seven days is the only major measurement of time (unlike the day, month, or year) that has no basis in astronomy. It exists solely because God established it at Creation.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a night sky filled with stars, with a faint glow of dawn on the horizon, emphasizing the rhythm of creation.

---

Slide 9 Question: How does God describe the neglect of His Sabbath by religious leaders?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient priest in the temple shadows, turning his face away from the light of the Menorah.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Her priests have violated My law... and have hid their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.” (Ezekiel 22:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dusty, neglected scroll of the law sitting on a shelf, while figures in the background ignore it.

---

Slide 11 Definition: **"Hid their eyes"** implies a willful ignorance. It suggests looking the other way to avoid acknowledging an inconvenient truth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure covering their eyes with their hand to block out a bright beam of light.

---

Slide 12 Insight: The Wall and the Mortar
[SN] The text in Ezekiel 13 and 22 compares God’s law to a protective wall. When a gap (breach) appears, false teachers try to fix it with "untempered mortar" (whitewash or weak plaster). This represents using weak arguments or vain assurances to cover up the fact that God's law has been broken.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stone wall with a visible crack, where someone is applying thin, white plaster over the damage rather than fixing the stone.

---

Slide 13 Question: What title is given to those who restore the true Sabbath in the last days?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a strong figure standing amidst ruins, holding a measuring reed and a builder's trowel.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.” (Isaiah 58:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people working together to lift a heavy foundation stone back into place in an ancient wall.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: God calls for a movement to rebuild the "wall" of His law. This is not about innovation, but restoration—clearing the debris of tradition to find the ancient path God originally laid down.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an overgrown ancient stone path being cleared of vines and debris, revealing the solid road beneath.

---

Slide 16 Question: What does it mean to "turn away thy foot" from the Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pair of sandaled feet pausing at a threshold, deciding which way to step.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable...” (Isaiah 58:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family gathered around a table on the Sabbath, expressions of joy and peace, soft candlelight.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: To "turn away thy foot" means to stop trampling on something. We are called to stop treating holy time as common time. Instead of using the day for personal business or entertainment, we are to view it as a "delight"—a spiritual banquet with the King.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a majestic banquet table set for a king, waiting for guests to arrive.

---

Slide 19 Illustration:
[ILL] If a friend visits your home, you stop your work to focus on them. The Sabbath is a weekly appointment where God visits us; we stop our work to give Him our full attention.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a homeowner warmly welcoming a guest at the door, work tools set aside in the background.

---

Slide 20 Question: Is the blessing of the Sabbath limited only to the Jewish people?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of travelers from different lands approaching the gates of Jerusalem.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord... everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it... even them will I bring to My holy mountain.” (Isaiah 56:6-7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a high mountain bathed in divine light, with people of all nations ascending the path.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: The Sabbath was given to mankind (Mark 2:27), not just one nation. In the last days, God invites "strangers" (Gentiles/all nations) to join the covenant by honoring His day.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open scroll being offered to a person in foreign garments, symbolizing a universal invitation.

---

Slide 23 Question: How are God’s people identified in the final days of earth's history?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small group of faithful people looking upward with hope, surrounded by a chaotic world.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two stone tablets (Commandments) and a cross (Faith of Jesus) intertwined or resting together in light.

---

Slide 25 Deeper Insight: The "Remnant" (the last remaining piece of faithful fabric) is identified by two characteristics: they hold to the faith *of* Jesus (salvation by grace), and they keep the commandments *of* God (obedience/law). They do not separate faith from obedience.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a loom with a final, beautiful piece of cloth being woven, representing the remnant.

---

Slide 26 Question: Will the Sabbath be observed in the New Earth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a perfect, restored landscape with a new city in the distance, glowing with ethereal light.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make... shall remain... from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 66:22-23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast multitude of people in white robes worshipping together in a paradise setting.

---

Slide 28 Insight: Eden Restored
[SN] The Sabbath is the link between Eden lost and Eden restored. It was kept before sin entered the world, and it will be kept after sin is destroyed. It is the eternal sign of God's creative power and authority.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting a bridge of light connecting the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem.

---

Slide 29 Practical Application:
We are living in the time of the "breach." The invitation today is to be a "Repairer." This begins by:
• Searching Scripture to distinguish God's plants from man's plants.
• Hallowing the Sabbath in our own homes as a delight.
• Trusting in the "faith of Jesus" to give us power to obey.
