Study Title: The Two Beasts and the Lamb-Like Nation

---

Slide 1 Question: What symbolic conflict is introduced in Revelation 12 regarding the birth of Christ?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.” (Revelation 12:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic prophetic vision, a shadowy dragon silhouette looming near a woman protecting her newborn, soft light on the child.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The prophecy depicts a struggle where a "dragon" power attempts to destroy a "man child" destined to rule all nations.

---

Slide 4 Insight: While the child represents Christ (Hebrews 12:2), the dragon represents Satan working through the civil power of Rome, specifically manifested when Herod sought to kill Jesus in Bethlehem.

Slide 5 Question: As history progresses, what power receives its authority from the dragon?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea... and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.” (Revelation 13:1, 2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophetic beast rising majestically from the ocean waves, crowned and imposing.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: A new power arises from the "sea," which represents peoples and nations. Historically, as the capital of the Roman Empire moved to Constantinople, the ancient seat of Rome was eventually given to the Bishop of Rome.

---

Slide 8 Historical Context: By A.D. 538, the Papacy had secured religious and civil supremacy, deriving its authority from the established Roman power.

[DYK] The transfer of power from pagan Rome to papal Rome is a recognized historical shift. The "seat" of the empire became the seat of the church.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a grand throne room being transferred from a Roman Emperor to a religious figure, symbolized by the passing of a scepter.

---

Slide 9 Question: How was the rule of this first beast interrupted?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a broken sword lying on stone pavement.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death... He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.” (Revelation 13:3, 10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a powerful ruler being led away in chains by soldiers in late 18th-century attire.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: This "deadly wound" represents a temporary cessation of power. After centuries of dominance, the Papacy was "led into captivity" in 1798.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of French General Berthier entering Rome, soft historical lighting, signifying a change in eras.

---

Slide 12 Historical Fulfillment: The French general Berthier entered Rome, proclaimed a republic, and took Pope Pius VI prisoner. This exact fulfillment marks the end of the beast's initial supremacy.

[SN] The principle of divine justice is evident here: the power which "killed with the sword" (persecution) was eventually "killed with the sword" (military intervention).

---

Slide 13 Question: At the very time the first beast went into captivity (1798), what new power was seen rising?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise over a vast, untouched landscape of mountains and valleys.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” (Revelation 13:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gentle beast with two small horns rising quietly from the solid ground, contrasting with the turbulent sea.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Unlike the first beast which rose from the "sea" (crowded populations), this one rises from the "earth" (a previously unoccupied or sparsely settled area) around 1798. This points unmistakably to the United States of America.

---

Slide 16 Term Definition: “Horns” in prophecy represent kingdoms or powers. “Lamb-like” suggests youthfulness, innocence, and gentleness.

[ILL] Think of a plant growing in a garden versus a tree springing up in the wild. The nations of Europe warred for space (the sea), but this new nation grew up silently and gradually from the earth, like a plant.

---

Slide 17 Question: What is the significance of the "two horns like a lamb"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lamb standing peacefully, focusing on the details of its face and horns.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The text describes a power that appears gentle. The two horns, having no crowns (unlike the first beast), represent the two leading principles of this government: civil liberty and religious liberty.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two parchment scrolls side by side, representing the Constitution and the Bible.

---

Slide 19 Insight: It is a state without a king and a church without a pope.

[DYK] In 1776, the conceded domain of the United States was less than half a million square miles. By 1875, it had grown to over three million square miles—a rapid, "lamb-like" growth that astonished the world.

Slide 20 Question: Despite its gentle beginning, how does this nation eventually speak?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lamb casting a shadow that looks like a dragon.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “And he spake as a dragon.” (Revelation 13:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a legislative hall where the atmosphere is tense and shadowy, suggesting oppressive decisions.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: There is a startling contradiction between the appearance (lamb) and the voice (dragon). A nation "speaks" through its laws. The prophecy warns that this defender of liberty will eventually enact oppressive laws similar to the first beast.

---

Slide 23 Question: What specific action will this power take to mimic the first beast?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sculptor chiseling a statue that resembles an ancient ruler.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “Saying unto them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.” (Revelation 13:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd gathering around a large, imposing statue or monument, illuminated by torchlight.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: To make an "image" to the beast is to replicate the system of the Papacy—a union of church and state where religious dogmas are enforced by civil power.

[SN] The "Image of the Beast" is the counterfeit of the "Image of God." God restores His image through love; the beast stamps its image through force.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a cross and a sword tied together, symbolizing the forced union of church and state.

---

Slide 26 Question: What are the consequences for those who refuse to comply with this image?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a marketplace with a merchant turning a buyer away, a look of sorrow on the buyer's face.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.” (Revelation 13:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands exchanging coins, but one hand is being stopped or blocked.

---

Slide 28 Explanation: The ultimate result is the loss of religious liberty. Economic sanctions and threats are used to force the conscience. This highlights the importance of understanding true liberty in Christ before these events unfold.

---

Slide 29 Practical Application:
1. **Recognize the Times:** History confirms prophecy.
2. **Value Liberty:** Cherish and use current freedom to spread the Gospel.
3. **Trust God:** God preserves His people through all conflicts.
