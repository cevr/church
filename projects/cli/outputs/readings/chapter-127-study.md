Study Title: The Divine Law of Forgiveness

Question: What spirit must accompany our prayers for them to be acceptable to God?

Biblical Answer: “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your Father also which is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses.” (Mark 11:25)

Explanation: Prayer is a two-way channel of communication. If the channel of mercy is blocked between us and our fellow man, it is also blocked between God and us. We cannot grasp God’s pardon with one hand while choking our brother with the other.

[DYK] The verse mentions "standing" to pray. While kneeling is a common posture of humility, standing was a standard Jewish posture for prayer in the synagogue and temple. The physical posture matters less than the posture of the heart.

Question: Is our forgiveness from God conditional upon our forgiveness of others?

Biblical Answer: “But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.” (Mark 11:26)

Explanation: This is a solemn warning. God does not withhold forgiveness arbitrarily; rather, an unforgiving heart is a hard heart. A heart that refuses to show mercy is incapable of receiving it. The flow of grace must be continuous—received from Heaven and passed on to earth.

[SN] It is significant to note that in the Lord’s Prayer ("Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors"), this is the *only* petition to which Jesus adds a specific commentary or condition afterward (Matthew 6:14-15). This highlights the supreme importance of this principle in the Christian life.

Question: How often are we required to forgive someone who wrongs us?

Biblical Answer: “Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.” (Matthew 18:22)

Explanation: Peter thought he was being generous by suggesting seven times, as rabbinical teaching often suggested three times was sufficient. Jesus’ answer implies that forgiveness is not a mathematical count, but a limitless attribute of character.

Question: How does Jesus illustrate the difference between what we owe God and what others owe us?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king... one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents... the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.” (Matthew 18:23-27)

Explanation: In the parable, the servant owed the king ten thousand talents—an unpayable sum. Yet, after being forgiven, he attacked a fellow servant who owed him a mere hundred pence.

[DYK] A "talent" was a massive unit of weight for silver or gold. "Ten thousand talents" represents millions of dollars in modern currency—a debt impossible for a servant to pay in a lifetime. "Hundred pence" represents roughly a few months' wages. The contrast shows that our sins against God are infinite compared to the finite wrongs others commit against us.

[ILL] Imagine a man whose multi-million dollar mortgage is cancelled by a benevolent bank, who then immediately goes outside and bashes his neighbor for borrowing five dollars. This captures the absurdity of an unforgiving Christian.

Question: Is it sufficient to forgive in words only, or to forgive while holding a memory of the wrong?

Biblical Answer: “So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses.” (Matthew 18:35)

Term Definition: **Grudge**: The source text clarifies that saying "I can forgive, but I cannot forget" is actually "holding a grudge." True forgiveness, like God's, casts the offense away.

Explanation: Forgiveness must not be a mere formality. It must come "from the heart." Leviticus 19:18 forbids bearing any grudge, and Romans 12:8 instructs us to show mercy "with cheerfulness."

[SN] Tangent on Restoration: When a brother or sister falls, Galatians 6:1 instructs us to restore them in a "spirit of meekness." We are not to be superior judges, but fellow travelers who recognize we too could be tempted. Forgiveness is a work of restoration, not just a release of debt.

Question: Whose example are we to follow when we forgive?

Biblical Answer: “Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you so also do ye.” (Colossians 3:13)

Deeper Insight: We do not originate forgiveness; we reflect it. We forgive "even as" Christ forgave us. His forgiveness was sacrificial, unmerited, and complete.

Practical Application:
The law of forgiveness is essential for spiritual health.
1. **Self-Examination**: Do I have "aught against any"?
2. **Action**: If a sin is confessed, we must forgive and "comfort" the person (2 Cor. 2:7) to prevent despair.
3. **Attitude**: We must show mercy cheerfully, not grudgingly.

By releasing others, we open our own hearts to the fullness of God's love.
