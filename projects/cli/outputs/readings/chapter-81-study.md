Study Title: The Safety of Obedience

Question: How does God compare religious rituals with actual obedience to His voice?

Biblical Answer: “Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.” (1 Samuel 15:22)

Explanation: In this account, King Saul tried to cover up his partial disobedience by offering sacrifices to God. The prophet Samuel clarifies that religious activity (sacrifices, attending services, giving offerings) is never a substitute for actually doing what God asked. God desires a surrendered heart more than religious ceremony.

[DYK] The "fat of rams" was considered the choicest, most valuable part of the sacrificial animal. Samuel was saying that even giving God the very best material gifts is worthless if we are simultaneously refusing to listen to Him.

Question: What excuse is often given for compromising God's commands?

Biblical Answer: “I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord, and thy words; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.” (1 Samuel 15:24)

Explanation: Saul admitted that peer pressure—the fear of public opinion—caused him to compromise. He valued the voice of the crowd more than the voice of God.

[ILL] Imagine a builder who follows the blueprints perfectly until the neighbors shout that they prefer the wall in a different spot. If the builder listens to the neighbors instead of the architect, the house may collapse. We are building a life, and God is the Architect.

Question: How strictly does God require us to stick to His written Word?

Biblical Answer: “Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish aught from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.” (Deuteronomy 4:2)

Explanation: We are not to "edit" God's instructions. We should not add extra burdens God never required, nor delete commandments that feel inconvenient.

Term Definition: "Strange Fire" (Leviticus 10:1) refers to unauthorized fire used by Nadab and Abihu in the sanctuary. God had specified exactly where the coals were to come from (the altar), but they substituted it with common fire. This illustrates that when God specifies a method, He expects us to follow it, not substitute our own preferences.

Question: If a religious leader or "prophet" tells us something that contradicts what God has already commanded, whom should we obey?

Biblical Answer: “Thus saith the Lord, Forasmuch as thou has disobeyed the mouth of the Lord... and hast eaten bread and drunk water... thy carcass shall not come unto the sepulcher of thy fathers.” (1 Kings 13:21-22)

Explanation: This answer comes from a sobering story in 1 Kings 13. A "man of God" had specific orders from the Lord not to eat in a certain place. An older prophet lied to him, claiming an angel told him it was okay to eat. The man of God was punished because he trusted the word of a man—even a claiming prophet—over the clear Word of God.

[SN] This narrative was vital to early Adventists and SDA pioneers. It reinforced the Protestant principle that the Bible stands above church tradition, feelings, or the claims of religious dignitaries. If a "new message" contradicts the established "written Word," the written Word must always prevail.

Question: Jesus describes two foundations for life. Who builds on the rock?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock... And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand.” (Matthew 7:24, 26)

Explanation: The difference between the wise and foolish man was not their knowledge—both "heard" the sayings. The difference was action. Obedience acts as an anchor. When the storms of life (or judgment) come, only the life constructed on doing God's will remains standing.

Deeper Insight: The source text notes that many today unknowingly build on sand regarding the Fourth Commandment. The text plainly reads, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord," yet tradition often substitutes the first day. As with the "Man of God" in 1 Kings 13, we are safer following exactly what God wrote rather than what popular tradition suggests.

Practical Application: How can we apply this today?
• **Audit our inputs:** Are we listening to "the people" (culture/media) more than Scripture?
• **Check our foundations:** Are there clear commands (like the Sabbath, honesty, or forgiveness) we are ignoring because it is inconvenient?
• **Take action:** Faith is not just agreeing with God mentally; it is moving our feet in the direction He points.

[ILL] A map is useless if you refuse to turn the steering wheel. The Bible is the map; obedience is the driving. God wants to take us safely home.
