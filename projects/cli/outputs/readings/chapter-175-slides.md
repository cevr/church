Slide 4 Term Definition: “Temperance” (Greek: *egkrateia*) means “inner strength” or “mastery.” In the historic Adventist understanding, it is defined as distinct abstinence from things that are harmful and the moderate use of things that are good.

Slide 5 Illustration: Imagine a powerful river. Without a dam or banks, it causes a flood and destruction. With a dam (control), that same water generates power and brings life. Temperance is the bank that directs the flow of our life for good.

Slide 6 Question: Why is self-control necessary for the Christian life?

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things... I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.” (1 Corinthians 9:25, 27)

---

Slide 8 Explanation: Paul uses the metaphor of an athlete. Just as a runner trains their body to win a race, a Christian must bring their physical desires under the control of their spiritual mind to succeed in the race of faith.

Slide 9 Question: What are the practical dangers of intemperance, specifically regarding alcohol?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine...” (Proverbs 23:29, 30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sorrowful figure sitting alone with head in hands, soft light emphasizing regret and weariness.

---

Slide 11 Progressive Disclosure: The consequences of intemperance:
• Emotional distress (woe/sorrow)
• Relational conflict (contentions)
• Physical harm (wounds)
• Loss of mental clarity (babbling)

Slide 12 Did You Know? The Bible often links physical health with spiritual health. The “redness of eyes” mentioned in Proverbs indicates a physical inflammation caused by alcohol, signaling that the body is being poisoned.

Slide 13 Question: Why does God strictly warn leaders (Kings and Priests) against intoxicating drink?

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “It is not for kings to drink wine... lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment... Do not drink wine nor strong drink... when ye go into the tabernacle... that ye may put difference between holy and unholy.” (Proverbs 31:4, 5; Leviticus 10:8-10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wise king sitting on a throne, looking clear-eyed and just, holding a scepter.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Alcohol compromises the ability to think clearly and make moral distinctions. For the priest, it destroyed the ability to distinguish between the "holy" and the "common."

---

Slide 16 Speaker Note: Spirit-led tangent: In the New Testament, believers are called a "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9). Therefore, the prohibition given to the sons of Aaron applies spiritually to every believer today who wishes to serve God with a clear mind.

Slide 17 Question: What is the result when we choose to abstain from harmful substances?

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank... And in all matters of wisdom and understanding... he found them ten times better than all the magicians...” (Daniel 1:8, 20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of young Daniel standing politely but firmly before a Babylonian official, refusing a golden cup.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Daniel and his friends chose water and "pulse" (plant-based food) over the king's luxuries. The result was not only better physical health ("fairer and fatter") but significantly superior mental wisdom.

Slide 20 Question: Does the Bible speak of two different kinds of "wine"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two vessels: one containing fresh grape juice and the other an old fermented wineskin, portraying a choice.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer:
**The Good:** “Thus saith the Lord, As the new wine is found in the cluster... destroy it not; for a blessing is in it...” (Isaiah 65:8)
**The Bad:** “Look not thou upon the wine when it is red... when it moveth itself aright. At the last it biteth like a serpent...” (Proverbs 23:31, 32)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lush vine with a heavy cluster of purple grapes, soft sunlight illuminating the fruit.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Scripture distinguishes between the fresh, unfermented juice of the grape (a blessing) and fermented, alcoholic wine (a mocker).
• **Good Wine:** "Pure blood of the grape" (Deut 32:14).
• **Bad Wine:** Wine that "moveth itself aright"—describing fermentation.

---

Slide 23 Did You Know? The ancients knew how to preserve grape juice without fermentation. They often boiled it down to a thick syrup or sealed it air-tight. When the Bible speaks of wine as a blessing, it refers to this nutritious fruit of the vine.

Slide 24 Question: How serious is the sin of drunkenness in the eyes of God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a storm cloud gathering, shafts of light piercing through, portraying gravity and seriousness.

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards... shall inherit the kingdom of God.” (1 Corinthians 6:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the golden gates of a city, viewed from a distance, representing the Kingdom of God.

---

Slide 26 Explanation: Intemperance is not just a bad habit; it is a spiritual barrier that prevents entrance into the Kingdom. It is often associated with other fleshly sins like strife and sedition (Galatians 5:19-21).

Slide 27 Practical Application: How can we practice temperance today?
• Ask God for the Fruit of the Spirit daily.
• Abstain from substances that cloud the mind.
• Practice moderation in good things (eating, work, recreation).
• Protect our "temple" to clearly discern God's will.

---

Slide 28 Deeper Insight: The ultimate goal of temperance is not just health, but holiness. By keeping the body in subjection, we ensure that our lower nature (flesh) does not dictate to our higher nature (mind/spirit), leaving us free to commune with God.
