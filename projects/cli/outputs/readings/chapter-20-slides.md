Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” (Matthew 28:19)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The instruction follows a specific order: first comes teaching (making disciples), then comes baptism. It is a public entry into the family of God, authorized by the full authority of the Godhead.

Slide 4 Word Study: What does "Baptize" mean?

[DYK] The Greek word for "baptize" is *baptizo*, which literally means "to dip," "to plunge," or "to immerse." In secular Greek of the time, it was used to describe sinking a ship or dyeing cloth by dipping it completely into dye.

Slide 5 Question: What spiritual preparation is necessary before a person is baptized?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you... Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 2:38; Acts 20:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man kneeling in prayer, expression full of genuine sorrow and hope, soft light from above.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Baptism is an outward expression of an inward change. Two things are required: repentance (turning away from sin) and faith (turning toward Jesus). We must realize our sinful condition (Romans 3:23) before we can accept the remedy.

Slide 8 Question: Why is baptism described as a burial?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open rock-hewn tomb with the stone rolled away, symbolizing death and resurrection, soft dawn light.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a baptism in a river, the water disturbed as someone is raised up, capturing the motion of resurrection, sunlight sparkling on the water.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: This is the heart of the doctrine. Baptism is a memorial of Christ’s death and resurrection. The candidate goes under the water (death/burial of the old life) and rises out of the water (resurrection to a new life).

[ILL] Consider a funeral. We do not bury people by sprinkling a handful of dirt on their shoulder; we bury them completely in the earth. Similarly, to symbolize the death of the "old man of sin," the believer is completely buried in the water.

Slide 11 Term Definition: "The Old Man"

"Old Man" (Romans 6:6) refers to our former self—the nature controlled by sinful desires and selfishness. This "old man" is crucified with Christ so we are no longer slaves to sin.

Slide 12 Question: Does the Bible specify the mode (method) of baptism?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch standing beside a chariot near a body of water, discussing the scroll of Isaiah.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.” (Acts 8:38)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two figures wading deep into a river, waist-deep in water, ready for immersion, soft natural light.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch went *down into* the water. If baptism were merely sprinkling or pouring, they could have utilized water from a container. The physical action aligns with the spiritual symbolism of burial.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Apostle Paul asserts there is “One Lord, one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). While traditions vary, the Bible presents a unified method. Even historical scholars from denominations that practice sprinkling admit the primitive church practiced immersion.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scroll open to the book of Ephesians, glowing with a warm, unifying light in a dim room.

Slide 15 Question: Can infants or those too young to understand the gospel be scripturally baptized?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family listening intently to a preacher in a home setting, expressions showing understanding and engagement.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved...” (Mark 16:16). “And they spake unto him the word of the Lord... and he... rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.” (Acts 16:32, 34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Philippian jailer and his household rejoicing together, faces illuminated by lamp light and joy.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: Belief is a prerequisite for baptism. In the case of the Philippian jailer, the household was baptized only after they heard the Word and *believed*. One must be old enough to understand sin, repentance, and faith to truly "put on Christ."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a young person looking thoughtfully at the Scriptures, depicting the dawn of understanding and faith.

---

Slide 18 Question: After baptism, how should the believer live?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure walking up a mountain path toward the sunrise, looking upward, symbolizing a new journey.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.” (Colossians 3:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ seated at the right hand of God in glory, seen faintly through the clouds, soft majestic light.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Emerging from the water is the beginning, not the end. It marks the start of a new life where our affections are set on heavenly things, empowered by the Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove descending with rays of light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit empowering a believer.

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: The Marriage Ceremony

Baptism is the public "marriage ceremony" to Christ. Just as a wedding doesn't create love (that happens first), baptism doesn't magically create faith; it publicly declares a union that has already taken place in the heart.

Slide 22 Practical Application

Have you experienced the death of the "old man"? If you have repented and accepted Jesus, baptism is your privilege and duty—a public testimony that you now belong to the King.
