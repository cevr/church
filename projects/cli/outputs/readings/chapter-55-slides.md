Study Title: The Seven Seals: History Foretold

---

Slide 1 Question: What symbol represents the beginning of the Christian era under the first seal?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals,... a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.” (Revelation 6:1, 2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rider on a magnificent white horse, holding a bow, riding victoriously through clouds with a crown upon his head, soft golden light.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: In Bible prophecy, a horse symbolizes battle or movement. White represents purity. This describes the apostolic church of the first century—pure in doctrine and "conquering" the world with the Gospel.

[DYK] In Roman history, a general returning from a great victory would ride a white horse in a triumphal procession. This imagery fits Christ’s church going forward victoriously in its early years.

Slide 4 Question: How does the symbol change under the second seal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the second seal on a scroll being broken, with a reddish hue glowing from the parchment.

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “...there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another...” (Revelation 6:3, 4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a powerful red horse rearing up, its rider holding a large sword, dramatic lighting suggesting conflict and intensity.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The color shifts from white (purity) to red (corruption). This represents the post-apostolic period where worldliness entered the church. As the church sought political power, the peace of the Gospel was lost to internal strife.

[ILL] Imagine a clear stream of water. If you mix in red clay, it becomes murky and undrinkable. Similarly, when the "clay" of secular politics mixed with the "water" of life, the church’s purity was compromised.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a clear stream becoming muddied with red earth, set in a pastoral landscape, soft light.

---

Slide 7 Question: What condition of the church is revealed by the third seal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the third wax seal being broken, revealing a shadow falling across the scroll.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.” (Revelation 6:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark black horse, its rider holding a set of antique brass weighing scales, shadowy and somber atmosphere.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: Black is the opposite of white, representing spiritual darkness. This covers the era from Constantine to the establishment of the Papacy (A.D. 538). Human philosophy and superstition began to replace the plain teachings of the Bible.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dimly lit medieval scriptorium, shadows obscuring the scrolls, historically respectful.

---

Slide 10 Term Definition: "Balances" (Scales).
Scales often represent judgment or commerce. Here, religion became a transaction rather than faith. Truth was "weighed" against human tradition and found wanting.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an old set of balances tipping to one side, soft light highlighting the inequality of the weight.

---

Slide 11 Question: What is the result of this spiritual darkness under the fourth seal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the fourth seal cracking open, revealing a sickly, pale vapor.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “...behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them... to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death...” (Revelation 6:7, 8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pale, ashen-colored horse moving through a desolate landscape, the rider cloaked in shadow, historically respectful.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The "pale" color describes the sickly look of a blighted plant. This represents the era of intense persecution during the Dark Ages. As the church exercised civil power, "Death" followed those who disagreed with established dogmas.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lone candle flickering in a vast, dark cavern, symbolizing the fragility of life during the Dark Ages.

---

Slide 14 Question: Upon the opening of the fifth seal, what was seen?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the fifth seal being removed, revealing a glow from beneath the scroll.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.” (Revelation 6:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden altar in a temple, with a soft, ethereal light emanating from the base, historically respectful.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: This scene depicts the Reformation era. As Reformers exposed past errors, the memory of the martyrs "cried out" for justice. This is symbolic personification, much like Abel's blood crying from the ground (Genesis 4:10).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a 16th-century reformer reading a Bible by candlelight, with a look of solemn realization.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The martyrs were given "white robes" (Rev 6:11). Although branded "heretics" by the church of their day, they are accounted as righteous by God. They rest in the grave awaiting the resurrection.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of white linen robes folded neatly, bathed in a pure, divine light, symbolizing righteousness and rest.

---

Slide 18 Question: What specific physical signs mark the opening of the sixth seal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the sixth seal breaking, with the background depicting a darkened sky.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “...lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth...” (Revelation 6:12, 13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic night sky, the moon turning deep red and stars streaking across the darkness, historically respectful.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: These represent historical events signaling the approaching end:
1. **The Great Earthquake:** Lisbon, 1755.
2. **The Dark Day:** New England, 1780.
3. **Falling Stars:** The meteoric shower of 1833.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: Jesus predicted the sun would darken "immediately after the tribulation" (Matt 24:29). Persecution ended in the mid-18th century, and these signs followed in exact order (1755, 1780, 1833).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd of people in 19th-century clothing looking up at a sky filled with falling meteors, soft lighting.

---

Slide 21 Question: What is the very next event to happen under the sixth seal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll rolling up in the sky, revealing a glimpse of blinding light behind it.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together: and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.” (Revelation 6:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a majestic mountain landscape trembling, with the sky above appearing to part like curtains.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: We are living between the falling stars (verse 13) and the rolling up of the heavens (verse 14). The next great scene in this prophetic line is the physical dissolution of earthly structures at the coming of Christ.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a horizon line at dawn, symbolizing the anticipation of a new day and the coming event.

---

Slide 24 Question: What happens when the seventh seal is finally opened?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the final seventh seal being broken, with a sense of profound stillness.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.” (Revelation 8:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavenly throne room, empty and silent, bathed in glorious but still light.

---

Slide 26 Explanation: The seventh seal marks the Second Coming. Heaven is silent because the angelic hosts have left to accompany Jesus to earth (Matthew 25:31). The focus of the universe is entirely on the return of the King.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast host of angels descending from clouds, leaving the golden gates behind them.

---

Slide 27 Term Definition: "Half an hour" in prophecy.
*   1 prophetic day = 1 literal year.
*   1 prophetic hour = approx. 15 days.
*   "Half an hour" = approx. 7 days.
This represents the time for Christ and His angels to journey to earth and return.

---

Slide 28 Practical Application: We have seen the church's history move from purity (white) to compromise (red), darkness (black), and persecution (pale). We have seen the signs in the heavens. We now stand on the brink of the "silence in heaven." Are we ready for the King?
