---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Third Angel’s Message is the final call to humanity. It warns against false worship and shifting loyalty from God to human systems. It identifies a "beast," an "image," and a "mark" as things to be avoided at all costs.

---

Slide 4 Definition: What is a Beast?

[DYK] In prophecy, a "beast" is not a monster, but a symbol of a political power or kingdom (see Daniel 7:17, 23). The Bible uses symbols to portray the character and actions of nations.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient king sitting on a throne, with a symbolic lion resting calmly beside him, representing the strength and nature of a kingdom.

---

Slide 5 Question: What is the first power (beast) identified in this conflict?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a turbulent, dark sea with waves crashing against jagged rocks, under a stormy sky.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns... and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” (Revelation 13:1, 7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophetic vision, a mysterious silhouette rising from ocean waves, shrouded in mist, viewed from the safety of a sandy shore.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: This first power arises from the "sea" (representing multitudes/people, see Rev. 17:15). It is a persecuting power that makes war with the saints.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The "Sea" vs. The "Earth": In Revelation 13, the first beast comes from the "sea" (populated areas/Old World). The second beast comes from the "earth" (a new, relatively unpopulated area). This geographic distinction helps identify the players in the final events.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a medieval European city crowded with people, spires, and activity, representing the "sea" of humanity.

---

Slide 8 Historical Identification: The source text notes that this symbol represents the Roman Church system, which held sway over kings and nations for centuries, historically persecuting those who dissented.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient cathedral interior, grand and imposing, with shafts of light falling on stone pillars and monarchs bowing.

---

Slide 9 Question: What second power arises to aid the first?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast, quiet wilderness landscape, untouched and open, bathed in the soft light of dawn.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” (Revelation 13:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gentle lamb standing in a grassy field, but casting a shadow that resembles a dragon.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: This second power appears gentle ("like a lamb") and arises in a new territory ("earth"). However, its speech (laws/decrees) eventually becomes oppressive ("like a dragon").

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll containing laws and decrees, resting on a wooden table, half-illuminated by candlelight.

---

Slide 12 Historical Identification: The text identifies this symbol as the United States of America—a nation rising in a "new world" with lamb-like principles of liberty, which prophecy indicates will eventually enforce the dogmas of the first beast.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pristine, early American landscape with a simple wooden church and a courthouse in the distance, soft sunset light.

---

Slide 13 Question: How will this second power enforce the will of the first?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a marketplace in an ancient city, merchants trading wares, with some people being turned away.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark...” (Revelation 13:16, 17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands exchanging coins and goods, emphasizing the transaction, with a focus on the hands.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The "image of the beast" represents a union of church and state power. Economic sanctions—the inability to buy or sell—will be used to pressure people into false worship.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gavel resting on a Bible, symbolizing the merging of civil and religious authority.

---

Slide 16 Term Definition: Forehead vs. Hand

*   **Forehead:** Represents the mind, intellect, and decision (belief).
*   **Hand:** Represents actions and labor (forced compliance).

God accepts only free-will service (the mind); the beast accepts forced compliance (the hand).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man in deep thought touching his forehead, juxtaposed with a man working with his hands in a field.

---

Slide 17 Question: Amidst this pressure, how does God identify His faithful people?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small group of people huddled together in prayer during a storm, their faces peaceful and resolute.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bright light breaking through dark storm clouds, illuminating a faithful believer holding a staff.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: While the world follows the beast, God’s "remnant" is identified by two specific traits:
1.  They hold the **faith of Jesus**.
2.  They keep the **commandments of God**.

[ILL] Imagine a lighthouse in a storm. The waves (the beast's pressure) crash all around, but the lighthouse (the saints) stands firm on the rock. The "light" they shine is their obedience to God's law and their faith in Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sturdy stone lighthouse standing firm against crashing waves, beaming a strong light across the water.

---

Slide 20 Question: What constitutes the "Commandments of God"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses on Mount Sinai, holding the two stone tablets, glowing with divine radiance.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “And He declared unto you His covenant... even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone... and He added no more.” (Deuteronomy 4:13; 5:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the stone tablets resting in the Ark of the Covenant, illuminated by the Shekinah glory.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: The Ten Commandments are the unchangeable standard of God's government. God "added no more," implying they are complete and not to be altered by human tradition or church councils.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scribe looking at a perfect, finished scroll, engaging in no edits, respecting the text.

---

Slide 23 Question: Is it acceptable to keep *most* of God's law but ignore part of it?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavy iron chain, with one single link broken, causing the weight it held to fall.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.” (James 2:10, 11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a judge holding a balance scale, looking at a singular weight that tips the scale.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: The Law is a unity, like a chain. Breaking one link breaks the chain. The controversy in the last days will center on loyalty to God's specific commands versus human traditions.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden chain resting on a velvet cloth, emphasizing its unity and strength.

---

Slide 26 Deeper Insight: The Seal vs. The Mark

The text suggests that the mark of the beast is received by those who bow to human authority in religious matters, while the "seal" of God belongs to those who remain loyal to His specific commandments, even under persecution (Rev 12:17).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king's signet ring pressing a seal into hot wax, symbolizing ownership and protection.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application: A Call to Loyalty

*   **Check your compass:** Is your life guided by popular opinion or the Word of God?
*   **The True Test:** Are we willing to follow God's commandments even when it is socially or economically difficult?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a traveler checking an ancient compass on a foggy mountain path.

Slide 28 The Hope

God promises that those who keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus will have the "patience" to endure until the end.
