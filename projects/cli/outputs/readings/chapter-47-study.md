Study Title: The Shadow of the Cross: The Old Testament Sanctuary

Question: Why was Abel’s sacrifice accepted while Cain’s was not?

Biblical Answer: “By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.” (Hebrews 11:4)

Explanation: The difference was not merely in the items offered, but in the faith behind them. Abel’s sacrifice involved the shedding of blood, acknowledging that sin brings death and requires a substitute. This act of faith looked forward to the "precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish" (1 Peter 1:18-20).

[ILL] Imagine a shadow cast by a person standing around a corner. You cannot see the person yet, but the shadow proves they are there. The Old Testament sacrifices were the "shadow" cast by the reality of Jesus Christ’s future sacrifice.

Question: What was God’s purpose in commanding Moses to build a sanctuary in the wilderness?

Biblical Answer: “And let them make Me a sanctuary: that I may dwell among them.” (Exodus 25:8)

Explanation: God desired to be close to His people. However, because God is holy and humanity is sinful, a separation existed. The sanctuary system was God’s method of bridging that gap, allowing His presence to dwell in the center of the camp while dealing with the problem of sin.

[DYK] The sanctuary was portable. It was a tent structure (Tabernacle) about 15 by 45 feet, designed to be taken apart and carried. This symbolizes that God does not wait for us to come to Him; He journeys with His people through their wilderness.

Question: What was the central object in the Most Holy Place, and what did it contain?

Biblical Answer: “And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.” (Exodus 25:21) ... “And He wrote on the tables... the ten commandments... and put the tables in the ark.” (Deuteronomy 10:4-5)

Explanation: The Ark of the Covenant contained the moral standard of God's government: the Ten Commandments. Directly above the Law was the "Mercy Seat" (the solid gold cover).

Deeper Insight: This arrangement is profound. The Law (justice) demands obedience, but the Mercy Seat (grace) covers it. God communes with man "from above the mercy seat" (Exodus 25:22), signifying that His relationship with us is based on mercy covering the law, made possible by the blood sprinkled there.

[SN] The "Pattern" shown to Moses (Exodus 25:40, Hebrews 8:5) indicates that the earthly sanctuary was a miniature model of a greater, heavenly reality. Just as a blueprint represents a real building, the earthly tabernacle helps us understand the work Christ is currently doing in the heavenly sanctuary.

Question: In the daily service, how was sin transferred from the sinner to the sanctuary?

Biblical Answer: “And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin-offering in the place of the burnt offering.” (Leviticus 4:29)

Explanation: This is the doctrine of substitution. The sinner laid their hands on the animal, symbolically transferring their guilt to the innocent victim. The animal died because "the wages of sin is death" (Romans 6:23). The priest then took the blood into the sanctuary, symbolically transferring the record of that sin into the Holy Place.

Question: What special event happened once a year to remove these accumulated sins?

Biblical Answer: “For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.” (Leviticus 16:30)

Explanation: This was the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur). While the daily services resulted in the forgiveness of sins and the *transfer* of sin into the sanctuary, the Day of Atonement resulted in the *cleansing* of the sanctuary and the people. It was a day of judgment and final separation from sin.

Term Definition: "Atonement" in this context signifies expiation, satisfaction, and the restoration of a broken relationship. It involves the complete removal of the sin problem.

Question: What happened to the sins after the High Priest finished the work of reconciling the holy place?

Biblical Answer: “And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel... putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him away... into the wilderness.” (Leviticus 16:21)

Explanation: This second goat (the Scapegoat) was not killed as a sacrifice. Instead, the sins that had been atoned for by the Lord's goat were placed upon the Scapegoat, who was then banished.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Scapegoat (Azazel) represents the originator of sin (Satan). He does not make atonement for us—only the Lord’s goat, whose blood was shed, does that. However, once justice is satisfied by Christ, the ultimate responsibility for the existence of evil is placed back upon its author, and he is removed from God’s presence forever.

Practical Application: The sanctuary shows us the complete path of salvation.
1. **The Courtyard**: We accept Jesus as our sacrifice (Justification).
2. **The Holy Place**: We walk daily in the light of the Spirit and the bread of the Word (Sanctification).
3. **The Most Holy Place**: We look forward to the final blotting out of sin and being forever in God's presence (Glorification).

God wants to dwell with you today. Have you invited Him into the "sanctuary" of your heart?
