Study Title: A Remarkable Symbol: The Church in Light

**Based on Chapter 44 of *Daniel and the Revelation* by Uriah Smith**

Question: How does the Bible introduce the history of the true church in the book of Revelation?

Biblical Answer: “And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.” (Revelation 12:1)

Explanation: Prophecy often uses symbols to convey history. Here, a woman is used to represent the church. A pure, virtuous woman represents God’s faithful people, while a corrupt woman (as seen later in Revelation 17) represents a corrupt church. This "great wonder" outlines the experience of God’s people transitioning from the Old Testament era into the New.

[DYK] In the Bible, the relationship between God and His people is frequently compared to a marriage. Paul writes to the church in Corinth, "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:2).

Question: What does the "Sun" represent in this symbol?

Biblical Answer: “But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings...” (Malachi 4:2)

Explanation: Being "clothed with the sun" represents the glory of the Gospel dispensation—the era of the New Testament. Just as the sun is the supreme source of light in the physical world, Jesus Christ and His direct gospel message are the supreme light of the spiritual world. The church is wrapped in the brightness of Christ's righteousness.

[ILL] Imagine standing at high noon in a field; there are no shadows, only brightness. This is the position of the Christian church under the Gospel—fully illuminated by the reality of Jesus, no longer looking through the dimmer light of symbols and sacrifices.

Question: Why is the "Moon" under her feet, and what does it signify?

Biblical Answer: “For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things...” (Hebrews 10:1)

Explanation: The moon has no light of its own; it merely reflects the light of the sun. Similarly, the Mosaic dispensation (the Old Testament system of sacrifices and types) did not have inherent saving power. It shone by reflecting the light of the coming Messiah.
To have the moon "under her feet" does not mean she tramples or rejects it. Rather, it means she stands *upon* it as a foundation. The New Testament church stands upon the foundation of the Old Testament prophets but has risen into the superior glory of the Gospel sunlight.

Term Definition: **Dispensation**: A specific period of time in which God administers His government or reveals Himself in a specific way (e.g., the period of the sacrifices vs. the period of the Gospel).

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** Consider the beauty of this astronomical symbol. The moon (the Old Testament/Ceremonial Law) fades when the Sun (Christ) rises, yet the Sun is what gave the Moon its light all along. The sacrifices of the Old Testament only had value because they pointed to the future reality of Jesus. Once the reality (the Sun) appeared, the reflection (the Moon) was no longer the primary source of light, yet it remains the platform upon which the church stands.

Question: What is the meaning of the "Crown of Twelve Stars"?

Biblical Answer: [Derived from Scriptural Context] The number twelve is significantly linked to the governance of God’s people (12 tribes, 12 apostles).

Explanation: The twelve stars represent the twelve apostles of the Lamb. As the church entered the Gospel era, the apostles were the primary lights/messengers sent forth to illuminate the darkness of the world with the testimony of Jesus.

[DYK] In the Old Testament, the High Priest wore a breastplate with twelve stones representing the twelve tribes of Israel. In the New Testament symbol, the church wears a crown of twelve stars, representing the apostles who foundationalized the Christian church.

Deeper Insight: This vision presents the church not as a physical building, but as a dazzling, celestial body. She is clothed in light (Christ), standing on the prophetic foundation (Old Testament), and crowned with apostolic authority (New Testament). This emphasizes that the true church is defined by her relationship to God's Word and His Light.

Practical Application:
How does this symbol affect us today?
• It assures us that the Church is precious to God.
• It reminds us that we have the "full light" of the Gospel—we are without excuse if we walk in darkness.
• It encourages us to value both the Old and New Testaments as essential to our standing.

**Summary:** God’s church is called to reflect His light. Just as this woman is illuminated by the sun, moon, and stars, our lives should be illuminated by the fullness of Scripture.
