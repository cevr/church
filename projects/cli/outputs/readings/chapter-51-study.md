Study Title: The Second Angel’s Message: A Call to Purity

Question: What urgent announcement is made by the second angel in Revelation 14?

Biblical Answer: “And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” (Revelation 14:8)

Explanation: Following the first angel's announcement of the judgment, the second angel identifies a spiritual crisis. "Babylon" is declared "fallen." This is not a physical destruction, but a moral fall—a departure from the truth and simplicity of the gospel.

[DYK] The name "Babylon" originates from Babel, meaning "confusion." In prophecy, it represents a system of religious confusion that mixes truth with error.

Question: How does the Bible identify Babylon and her character?

Biblical Answer: “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color... And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.” (Revelation 17:4, 5)

Term Definition: **Woman in Prophecy**: In Scripture, a woman represents a church. A pure woman represents God's faithful people (Jeremiah 6:2; 2 Corinthians 11:2), while a corrupt woman (a harlot) represents a church that has been unfaithful to God.

[SN] Prophetic tangents: • The color purple (royalty) and scarlet (sin/blood) contrast with the white linen (righteousness of saints) found elsewhere in Revelation. • The title "Mother" implies she has "daughters"—other religious bodies that resemble her character.

Question: What constitutes the "fornication" or unfaithfulness of the church?

Biblical Answer: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?” (James 4:4)

Explanation: Spiritual adultery occurs when the church seeks the friendship of the world rather than relying on Christ. This "falling away" (2 Thessalonians 2:3) happens when the church adopts worldly customs, seeks political power, or dilutes the Bible to gain popularity.

[ILL] Imagine a ship. It is designed to be in the ocean, but the ocean must not get into the ship. As noted by G.F. Pentecost, if a ship has "rotten timbers," it will sink. Similarly, when the church allows the "world" to leak into its doctrines and practices, it loses its spiritual buoyancy and falls.

Question: Does this "fall" apply only to the mother church (Rome), or does it extend to others?

Biblical Answer: [Derived from Rev 17:5 "Mother of Harlots" and historical observation]

Explanation: If the mother is corrupt, the daughters who mimic her traits are also implicated. The source text notes that many Protestant denominations, though stepping out of Rome, retained "elements of Romanism"—such as relying on clerical interpretation rather than teaching the people the Bible in its purity. When a church turns from Scripture to tradition or worldliness, it partakes of the "wine of Babylon."

[DYK] In the 19th century, many evangelical leaders (like Hopkins and Atkins) confessed that "apostasy is engraved on the very front of every church" because they had become lovers of the world and respectability rather than lovers of cross-bearing.

Question: How does the Apostle Paul describe this spiritual condition in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

Explanation: The "fall" of Babylon results in a religion that looks correct on the outside ("a form of godliness") but lacks the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit ("denying the power"). It is a system built on social fashion rather than spiritual regeneration.

Question: What is God’s command to His sincere people who are currently inside these fallen systems?

Biblical Answer: “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” (Revelation 18:4)

Deeper Insight: This verse proves that God has many true, faithful people *inside* the systems of Babylon. He does not condemn the individuals, but the system. His call to "come out" is an act of mercy, guiding them to safety before the consequences of apostasy (the plagues) occur.

[SN] The Three Angels' Progression: • **1st Angel**: Announces the Judgment is come. • **2nd Angel**: Exposes the condition of the religious world (Babylon) as unfit for that judgment. • **3rd Angel**: Provides the remedy and the destination for those who come out.

Question: What is the "remedy" or the destination for those who come out of Babylon?

Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

Explanation: Those who leave the confusion of Babylon are called to a platform of truth characterized by two things: keeping the Commandments of God and holding the Faith of Jesus.

Practical Application: The message of the Second Angel invites us to examine our own spiritual lives.
*   Are we relying on "clerical interpretations" or studying the Bible for ourselves?
*   Have we allowed the "friendship of the world" to dilute our walk with God?
*   God invites us to step away from confusion and stand on the firm foundation of His Commandments and the faith of Jesus.
