Study Title: The Grace of True Submission

Question: To whom do we owe our primary and unqualified submission?

Biblical Answer: “Submit yourselves therefore to God.” (James 4:7)

Explanation: Submission is often viewed negatively in our culture, but in Scripture, it is the pathway to peace. The first step is recognizing our position relative to God.

Question: Why are we under obligation to submit to God?

Biblical Answer: “I have made the earth, and created man upon it... There is no God else beside Me; a just God and a Saviour.” (Isaiah 45:12, 21)

Explanation: We submit for two fundamental reasons:
1.  **Creation**: He made us; He understands how we are designed to function.
2.  **Redemption**: He is our Saviour. He has a right to us by creation and by purchase.

[DYK] The Greek word often translated as "submit" (*hupotasso*) is a military term meaning "to arrange [troop divisions] in a military fashion under the command of a leader." It implies an orderly arrangement for victory, not a humiliation of the soldier.

Question: What does true submission look like in our minds?

Biblical Answer: “Casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” (2 Corinthians 10:5)

Explanation: Submission begins inwardly. It involves surrendering our pride ("high things") and aligning our thought patterns with the example of Jesus.

Question: What is the specific "will of God" that we are submitting to?

Biblical Answer: “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

Progressive Disclosure: • Walking not after the flesh • Walking after the Spirit • Fulfilling the righteousness of the law (Romans 8:4)

Term Definition: **Sanctification**: The process of being made holy; a daily setting apart of oneself for God’s use, resulting in a life that reflects His character.

[ILL] Imagine a wild vine. Left to itself, it grows along the ground, gets muddy, and produces poor fruit. When a gardener lifts it and ties it to a trellis (submission/restriction), it may feel confined, but it is finally in a position to receive sunlight and bear sweet fruit.

Question: Which part of the body requires the greatest exertion and grace to bring into submission?

Biblical Answer: “The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.” (James 3:8)

Explanation: While we must present our whole bodies as a "living sacrifice" (Romans 12:1), the tongue is the true indicator of the heart's condition. To "bridle" the tongue requires the constant indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

[SN] Spirit-led Insight: The "Living Sacrifice" of Romans 12 presents a contrast to the Old Testament system. In the sanctuary service, the animal was slain. In the New Covenant, the believer is a *living* sacrifice. The challenge of a living sacrifice is that it can choose to crawl off the altar. Submission is the act of staying on the altar daily.

Question: How was submission perfectly exemplified in the life of Christ?

Biblical Answer: “He [Jesus] humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” (Philippians 2:8)

Deeper Insight: Jesus did not submit because He was powerless, but because He trusted the Father’s plan. His prayer in Gethsemane, "Thy will be done" (Matthew 6:10), is the ultimate model for the Christian.

Question: How does a Christian relate to worldly governments and authorities?

Biblical Answer: “Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates.” (Titus 3:1)

Explanation: Governments are ordained by God to maintain order (Romans 13:1). Christians should be exemplary citizens, respecting the laws of the land.

Question: Is there a limit to our submission to human authority?

Biblical Answer: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29)

Explanation: When human laws conflict with God’s express commands, the lower authority (man) must yield to the higher authority (God).

[DYK] The historic example of this is the three Hebrews in Daniel 3. They were submissive subjects of Babylon in all civil matters, but when the King commanded idolatry, they refused to bow. They honored the King’s authority over their bodies (by accepting the fire) but reserved their worship for God alone.

Question: How should believers relate to one another within the church?

Biblical Answer: “Yea, all of you, be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility.” (1 Peter 5:5)

Explanation: The Christian community is not a hierarchy of power, but a network of mutual service.

Question: What are the principles for submission in the home?

Biblical Answer: “Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.” (Colossians 3:18); “Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.” (Colossians 3:19)

Explanation: This submission is not slavish fear, nor does it permit tyranny. It is "fit in the Lord." The husband is called to love as Christ loves the church—a self-sacrificing love that makes submission a joy rather than a burden.

Practical Application: Where can you practice submission today?
• **In prayer:** "Not my will, but Thine be done."
• **In speech:** Holding back a sharp word.
• **In society:** Obeying laws and showing respect to officials.
• **In the home:** Serving one another in love.

God’s call to submission is actually a call to freedom from the heavy burden of running our own lives.
