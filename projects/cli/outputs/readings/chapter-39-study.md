Study Title: The Outpouring of the Spirit: Early and Latter Rain

Question: Just prior to His ascension, what specific instruction did Jesus give His disciples regarding their next steps?

Biblical Answer: “And, behold, I send the promise of My Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.” (Luke 24:49)

Explanation: Jesus commanded them to wait. Though they had the message of the Gospel, they lacked the spiritual power to share it effectively. They were to remain in Jerusalem until they received the "promise"—the baptism of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5).

[DYK] The period of "tarrying" (waiting) lasted ten days—from the Ascension to the day of Pentecost. During this time, the disciples put away their differences, humbled their hearts, and prayed in unity.

Question: What was the specific purpose of receiving this power?

Biblical Answer: “But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto Me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.” (Acts 1:8)

Explanation: The Holy Spirit was not given merely for the personal enjoyment of the disciples, but to equip them for service. The power was specifically for *witnessing*—spreading the truth from their local city to the ends of the earth.

[ILL] Imagine a powerful engine without fuel. The car (the disciples) and the destination (the world) are ready, but without the gasoline (the Holy Spirit), there is no movement. The Spirit provides the driving force for the mission.

Question: What were the immediate results when the Spirit was poured out at Pentecost?

Biblical Answer: “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.” (Acts 2:41) ... “And the word of God increased... and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.” (Acts 6:7)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Conviction**: People were "pricked in their heart" (Acts 2:37).
2.  **Conversion**: 3,000 people were baptized in one day.
3.  **Miracles**: Signs and wonders confirmed the message (Acts 5:12-14).
4.  **Growth**: Even Jewish priests, who had previously opposed Christ, accepted the faith.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The conversion of the priests is significant. These were men deeply entrenched in the ritual system and likely involved in the condemnation of Jesus. The power of the Spirit at Pentecost was strong enough to break through the hardest prejudices and religious traditions.

Question: Did persecution stop this Spirit-filled movement?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.” (Acts 8:4)

Explanation: Paradoxically, the persecution intended to stop the church actually fueled its growth. As believers were forced to leave Jerusalem, they carried the "fire" of the Spirit to new regions, fulfilling the command to go to Judea and Samaria.

Question: Which Old Testament prophecy did Peter quote to explain this outpouring?

Biblical Answer: “But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; And It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh...” (Acts 2:16-17; see Joel 2:28-29)

Term Definition: **Former and Latter Rain**. In Joel 2:23, the prophet speaks of the "former rain" and the "latter rain." In the agricultural cycle of Palestine:
*   **Former Rain (Autumn):** Softened the soil and allowed the seed to germinate (symbolizing Pentecost and the early church).
*   **Latter Rain (Spring):** Ripened the grain for the harvest (symbolizing the final outpouring of the Spirit before Christ returns).

[ILL] A farmer welcomes the rain at planting time to start the crop, but he is desperate for the rain at the end of the season to fill the grain heads. Without the second rain, the harvest is meager. Spiritually, the church needs the "Latter Rain" to ripen the world for the harvest of the Second Coming.

Question: What are we instructed to do regarding this final outpouring of the Spirit?

Biblical Answer: “Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain...” (Zechariah 10:1)

Explanation: Just as the disciples prayed for the early rain (Pentecost), we are to pray specifically for the latter rain to finish God's work on earth.

Question: How does the Book of Revelation describe the work of the church under this final "Latter Rain" power?

Biblical Answer: “And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with His glory.” (Revelation 18:1)

Deeper Insight: This angel represents God's people empowered by the Holy Spirit in the last days. The message is a final warning against spiritual confusion ("Babylon is fallen") and a loving appeal to God's people who are still in error ("Come out of her, My people," Rev 18:4).

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The "Loud Cry." Early Adventists understood Revelation 18 as the "Loud Cry" of the third angel—a final, magnified proclamation of the gospel message. This is not done by human effort alone but by the "refreshing" from the presence of the Lord (Acts 3:19). It parallels the power seen at Pentecost but extends to the entire globe.

Practical Application: We are living in the time of the "Latter Rain."
*   Are we "tarrying" in prayer like the early disciples?
*   Are we asking God to empty us of self so He can fill us with His Spirit?
*   The purpose of this power is to share the light; who can you share a ray of light with today?
