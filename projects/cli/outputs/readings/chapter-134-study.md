Study Title: The Principal Thing: Seeking True Wisdom

Question: What is the most important thing a person can gain in life?

Biblical Answer: “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom.” (Proverbs 4:7) “She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.” (Proverbs 3:15)

Explanation: The Bible establishes wisdom not merely as an option, but as the "principal" or primary pursuit of life. It is valued above material wealth ("rubies") because while wealth can be lost, wisdom guides one toward honor, grace, and an eventual "crown of glory" (Proverbs 4:8-9).

[DYK] King Solomon, who wrote many of the Proverbs, was offered anything he desired by God. He chose wisdom instead of long life or riches. Because he prioritized wisdom, God granted him the other blessings as well.

Question: Where does this wisdom come from, and how do we receive it?

Biblical Answer: “For the Lord giveth wisdom.” (Proverbs 2:6) “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (James 1:5)

Explanation: True wisdom is not a result of high IQ or academic degrees; it is a gift from God. The text assures us that God gives "liberally" (generously) without finding fault in us for asking.

[ILL] Imagine a child who needs help with a heavy load. If they ask a loving father, he doesn't scold them for being weak; he gladly provides the strength. So it is with God when we ask for wisdom.

Question: What is the condition for receiving this wisdom?

Biblical Answer: “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed.” (James 1:6)

Term Definition: "Wavering" here implies being double-minded or undecided. It describes a person who wants God's wisdom but also wants to hold onto worldly methods.

Question: What is the foundation of true wisdom?

Biblical Answer: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments.” (Psalm 111:10)

Explanation: Wisdom starts with a proper relationship with God—referenced here as "fear," which means deep reverence and awe. This text links intellectual understanding directly to obedience. Doing His commandments clarifies the mind.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The connection between *doing* and *knowing* is vital in Scripture. John 7:17 states that if anyone wills to do His will, he shall know the doctrine. In the Adventist pioneer perspective, obedience to the Law of God is not a means of earning salvation, but the atmosphere in which true spiritual understanding breathes and grows.

Question: How does the Bible distinguish between God's wisdom and the world's wisdom?

Biblical Answer: “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” (1 Corinthians 3:19) “But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits...” (James 3:17)

Progressive Disclosure:
*   **Worldly Wisdom**: Often characterized by competition, pride, and "foolishness" in the eyes of Heaven.
*   **Heavenly Wisdom**: Characterized by purity, peace, and mercy.

Deeper Insight: James 3:17 lists "pure" as the first quality of heavenly wisdom. In the original Greek, this implies being clean, holy, and free from defilement. Wisdom is moral, not just intellectual. One cannot be truly wise while cherishing sin.

Question: What is the physical and spiritual result of receiving God’s wisdom?

Biblical Answer: “A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.” (Ecclesiastes 8:1) “Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind...” (Romans 12:2)

Explanation: Wisdom changes a person from the inside out. Just as Moses' face shone after speaking with God, a person who walks in God's wisdom exhibits a change in countenance—softening hardness ("boldness") and replacing it with the light of grace.

[SN] This "renewing of the mind" allows the believer to "prove" (discern and demonstrate) the perfect will of God. It suggests that the human mind, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, becomes a testing ground where truth is validated against error.

Practical Application: How can we apply this search for wisdom today?
*   **Prioritize**: Value spiritual insight more than financial gain or social status.
*   **Pray**: Make a daily habit of asking God for wisdom in specific situations, believing He will answer.
*   **Obey**: Check your life against the Commandments; obedience clears the channel for wisdom to flow.
*   **Evaluate**: When making decisions, ask: "Is this path pure? Is it peaceable? Is it full of mercy?" If not, it is not from above.
