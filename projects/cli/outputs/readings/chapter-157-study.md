Study Title: The Danger of Covetousness: Seeking True Riches

Question: How does Jesus warn us against the desire to accumulate possessions?

Biblical Answer: “And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15)

Explanation: Jesus issues a double warning: "Take heed" (pay attention) and "beware" (guard against). He clarifies a fundamental truth: the value of a human life is not measured by net worth or inventory.

Term Definition: “Covetousness” means being inordinately desirous or excessively eager to obtain and possess. It is a hunger that is never satisfied.

[DYK] The Greek word for covetousness often used in the New Testament is *pleonexia*, which literally means "a desire to have more." It suggests a self-seeking spirit that grabs for itself regardless of others or God's will.

Question: How does God view the person who focuses solely on hoarding wealth for this life?

Biblical Answer: “But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided? So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.” (Luke 12:20-21)

Explanation: In the parable of the rich man who built bigger barns, God calls him a "fool"—not because he was wealthy, but because he left God out of his calculations. He prepared for a future he wouldn't see and neglected the eternity he was about to enter.

[ILL] Imagine a traveler spending all their money decorating a hotel room where they will only stay for one night, while saving nothing for the permanent home they are traveling to. This is the folly of living only for earthly treasure.

Question: Why does the Apostle Paul equate covetousness with idolatry?

Biblical Answer: “Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth... and covetousness, which is idolatry.” (Colossians 3:5)

Explanation: Idolatry is worshiping something created rather than the Creator. When we crave wealth or possessions so much that they consume our thoughts, drive our decisions, and provide our sense of security, those things have taken the place of God on the throne of our hearts.

[SN] Spirit‑led Insight: The Tenth Commandment ("Thou shalt not covet") is unique because it forbids an internal thought process rather than just an external action. It is the root from which other sins spring. For example, Judas’s covetousness led to betrayal (Mark 14:10-11), and David’s covetousness led to adultery and murder.

Question: What are the dangers of striving to be rich?

Biblical Answer: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.” (1 Timothy 6:9)

Explanation: The text describes the desire for riches as a "snare" (a trap). It is not the possession of money that destroys, but the resolve ("they that *will* be rich") to pursue it. This pursuit drowns the spiritual life.

Deeper Insight: The source text highlights that in the "last days," covetousness will be a prevailing sin (2 Timothy 3:1-2). James 5:3 warns that hoarded gold and silver will be "cankered" and stand as a witness against the selfish during the final judgment.

Question: Since God owns all the gold and silver (Haggai 2:8), how should we view our possessions?

Biblical Answer: “Charge them that are rich in this world... that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.” (1 Timothy 6:17-18)

Explanation: We are called to be stewards, not owners. A steward manages the master's resources for the master's purposes. The antidote to greed is generosity ("ready to distribute").

[ILL] A water pipe remains clean and functional only as long as water flows *through* it. If you block the outlet, the water becomes stagnant. Likewise, God’s blessings are meant to flow through us to others.

Question: What is the defining characteristic of the people Christ gathers when He returns?

Biblical Answer: “Gather My saints together unto Me; those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice.” (Psalm 50:5)

Explanation: While the covetous man gathers treasure for himself, Christ gathers a people who have a spirit of sacrifice. Because Jesus gave all to redeem us, His true children share His sacrificial nature, using their resources to bless others and advance God’s work.

Practical Application: How can we guard against covetousness this week?
• Review our spending: Does it reflect love for self or love for God?
• Practice giving: "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).
• Check our security: Are we trusting in a bank account or in the Living God?
