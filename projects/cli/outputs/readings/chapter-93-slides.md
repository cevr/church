Study Title: The Lord's Day: Christ and the Sabbath

---

Slide 1 Question: Who was the active agent in the creation of the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the cosmos being formed, swirling nebulae and stars emerging from darkness, soft light, historically respectful, portraying the act of creation.

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “...God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.” (Ephesians 3:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing amidst the newly created natural world, perhaps surrounded by animals and lush vegetation, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The New Testament clarifies that Jesus Christ was the active agent of Creation. The Father created all things *through* the Son. Therefore, when we read Genesis, we are seeing the handiwork of Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll of Genesis open on a wooden table, light falling on the text, implying a connection to Christ.

---

Slide 4 Deeper Insight: "In the beginning was the Word..."

[SN] Spirit‑led tangent: This aligns with John 1:1-3, describing Jesus as the "Word." Just as a spoken word reveals a thought, Jesus reveals the creative power of the Father. "Without Him was not anything made that was made."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beam of light illuminating a dark void, symbolizing the spoken Word creating matter.

---

Slide 5 Question: What did the Creator do immediately after finishing the creation of the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a peaceful Eden at sunset, the work finished, a sense of profound stillness and rest.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it...” (Genesis 2:2, 3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the sun setting over a pristine landscape, golden hour light casting long shadows, portraying the very first Sabbath.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Because Jesus is the Creator, it was Jesus who rested on the first seventh day. He performed three distinct acts on this day:
1. He **rested**.
2. He **blessed** it.
3. He **sanctified** it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in a contemplative posture of rest, looking over a valley, soft golden light.

---

Slide 8 Term Definition: Sanctified

**Sanctified** means "to set apart for a holy use." It is distinct from the other six working days.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple stone altar or marker set apart in a field, glowing with a gentle, holy light.

---

Slide 9 Did You Know?

The day, month, and year correspond to the movements of the earth, moon, and sun. However, the seven-day week has no astronomical basis; it exists solely because God established it at Creation.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient astronomer looking at the night sky with a telescope or astrolabe, contrasted with a scroll of scripture.

---

Slide 10 Question: Who does Jesus say acts as the "Lord" or owner of the Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking through a grain field on the Sabbath with his disciples, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching with authority, standing tall, a gentle halo of light around Him.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Jesus claims ownership of the day. He does not say the Sabbath is the "Lord's day" of the Jews only; He says the Sabbath was made for "man" (humanity) and that He is its Lord.

[ILL] If an architect designs a building, he knows its purpose better than anyone else. Because Christ (the Architect) built the world and established the Sabbath, He is the one who defines how it should be kept.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master builder or architect looking at blueprints or a model of a structure, symbolizing authority over the design.

---

Slide 13 Question: Did Jesus keep the Sabbath while He lived on earth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the interior of an ancient synagogue, dusty beams of light entering through windows.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” (Luke 4:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding a scroll in a synagogue, standing ready to read, surrounded by listeners.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: It was the "custom" or habit of Jesus to worship on the Sabbath. He affirmed that He kept His Father's commandments (John 15:10).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus praying or worshipping, soft focus, conveying a sense of holy habit and dedication.

---

Slide 16 Question: Did the Sabbath command end at the Cross, or did His followers continue to observe it?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the three crosses on Calvary in the distance, with a foreground of sorrowful followers.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.” (Luke 23:56)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of women in a dimly lit room preparing jars of spices and linen, their faces sad but determined.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: Even in the crisis of Jesus' death, His closest followers respected the commandment. They prepared spices on Friday, rested on the Sabbath, and went to the tomb on Sunday.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a quiet city street at twilight, no activity, symbolizing the Sabbath rest even during grief.

---

Slide 19 Progressive Disclosure: The Continuity of the Sabbath

• Christ kept it in life.
• Christ rested in the tomb on the Sabbath.
• The disciples kept it after His death.
• Paul kept it in his ministry (Acts 17:2).

[SN] Deeper Insight: Consider the "Magna Charta" of the Christian faith (Eph 2:20)—the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus as the cornerstone. Both upheld the Sabbath.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sturdy stone foundation of a building, highlighting the cornerstone.

---

Slide 20 Question: Which day is the "Lord's Day" mentioned in the book of Revelation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle John on the island of Patmos, looking up at a vision in the sky, sea crashing on rocks nearby.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day...” (Revelation 1:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elderly John writing on parchment, a divine light illuminating his face.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: John mentions the "Lord's day" but does not define it in that verse. However, looking at the rest of Scripture, there is only one day the Lord calls His own.

Scripture Check:
*   "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the **Lord** thy God" (Exodus 20:10)
*   Jesus is "**Lord** of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two scrolls being compared side-by-side, representing the Old and New Testaments agreeing.

---

Slide 23 Logic of Scripture:

1. The Sabbath is the Lord's Day (Exodus 20:10).
2. Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28).
3. Therefore, the "Lord's Day" John speaks of is the Sabbath.

[ILL] If a King declares, "This province belongs to me," and later refers to "The King's Province," his subjects know exactly which territory he is speaking of without him needing to draw a new map.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king holding a scepter, pointing to a map of his kingdom.

---

Slide 24 Question: Is the Law of God subject to change?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of stone tablets resting on a mountain, enduring and solid against the elements.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “All His commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever...” (Psalm 111:7, 8) and “It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” (Luke 16:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the night sky full of stars over a solid mountain range, representing the permanence of heaven and earth.

---

Slide 26 Explanation: The moral law reflects God's character, which does not change. Jesus came to "magnify the law" (Isaiah 42:21), showing its spiritual depth, not to abolish it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of light shining through a magnifying glass onto a text, revealing intricate details.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application: How does the Lord's Day affect us today?

• It provides a weekly reminder of our Creator.
• It allows us to rest in the finished work of Jesus.
• It is a day of "doing well" and spiritual refreshing.

God invites us to enter into the rest that He established for us at the very beginning.
