Study Title: The Sabbath: History, Prophecy, and Change

Question: When was the Sabbath established, and by whom?

Biblical Answer: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it...” (Genesis 2:2, 3)

Explanation: The Sabbath was not an afterthought; it was the climax of Creation. God performed three distinct acts upon the seventh day: He rested, He blessed it, and He sanctified it (set it apart for holy use). Because it was established in Eden, before the existence of any distinct nation, it is a gift to all humanity.

[DYK] The "week" is the only major division of time that has no astronomical basis. The year is based on the sun, the month on the moon, but the week is a monument to the creative cycle of God found in Genesis.

Question: Why does the Commandment say God put His blessing on the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11)

Term Definition: "Hallowed" means to keep holy or to treat with reverence. We do not *make* the Sabbath holy; God made it holy at Creation. We keep it holy by abstaining from labor and recognizing God as Creator.

[ILL] Imagine a birthday. You celebrate it not because of a law passed today, but because of an event that happened years ago. The Commandment begins with "Remember" because it points back to the "birthday" of the world.

Question: How did Jesus relate to the Sabbath during His life on earth?

Biblical Answer: “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” (Luke 4:16)

Explanation: Jesus, our example, kept the Sabbath as a lifelong custom. He did not treat it as a burden or a Jewish tradition to be discarded, but as a day for worship and the Word of God.

[SN] Many claim the Sabbath was only for the Jews. However, the text notes that the Sabbath was proclaimed 2,500 years after Creation at Sinai. It existed long before the Jewish people; it was part of God's moral law for mankind from the beginning.

Question: Did Jesus expect His followers to stop keeping the Sabbath after His resurrection?

Biblical Answer: “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.” (Matthew 24:20)

Progressive Disclosure: • Jesus is speaking here of the destruction of Jerusalem • This event occurred in A.D. 70, nearly 40 years after the Cross • Jesus expected His people to still be regarding the Sabbath as sacred long after His death.

Deeper Insight: If the Sabbath were to be abolished at the Cross, Jesus would not have instructed His disciples to pray about its observance forty years into the future. This indicates the continuity of the moral law in the Christian era.

Question: What acts does the Bible warn against regarding the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden... then I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof...” (Jeremiah 17:27)

Explanation: The prophet Jeremiah warned that carrying burdens (engaging in commerce and secular labor) on the Sabbath would lead to national ruin. The text connects the Babylonian captivity and the destruction of Jerusalem directly to the profaning of the Sabbath (Nehemiah 13:17-18).

Question: Since the Bible supports the seventh day, on what authority was the change to Sunday made?

Biblical Answer: “Had she [the Church] not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority.” (Doctrinal Catechism, as quoted in source text)

Explanation: History reveals that the shift from Sabbath to Sunday was not commanded by Christ or the Apostles. It was a gradual process involving:
1.  **Anti-Jewish Sentiment:** Seeking to separate from "the rabble of the Jews" (Constantine).
2.  **Pagan Influence:** Adopting the "venerable day of the sun" (Sun worship) to make Christianity easier for pagans to accept.
3.  **Human Authority:** Church councils (such as Laodicea, A.D. 364) placing anathemas on those who rested on the Sabbath.

[ILL] J.H. Robinson describes this historical process like two streams merging. Christianity and paganism met like armies in conflict, but eventually flowed together, blending the "day of the sun" with the worship of the Son of God.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The prophet Daniel predicted a power that would "think to change times and laws" (Daniel 7:25). The text notes that Sunday is a "plant" not of the Lord's planting, but sown by an "enemy" to lead people away from the sign of God's authority.

Practical Application: The Sabbath is more than a day off; it is a test of loyalty. Will we follow the custom of Christ and the Commandment of God, or the traditions of history? • It offers rest from the stress of the world • It identifies the Creator • It connects us to the apostolic church. God invites us to step out of the stream of tradition and onto the solid rock of Scripture.
