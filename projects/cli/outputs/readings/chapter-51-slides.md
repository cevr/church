---

Slide 1 Question: What urgent announcement is made by the second angel in Revelation 14?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.” (Revelation 14:8)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Second Angel identifies a spiritual crisis. "Babylon" is declared "fallen." This is not a physical destruction, but a moral fall—a departure from the truth and simplicity of the gospel.

Slide 4 Did You Know?

[DYK] The name "Babylon" originates from Babel, meaning "confusion." In prophecy, it represents a system of religious confusion that mixes truth with error.

Slide 5 Question: How does the Bible identify Babylon and her character?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color... And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the Earth.” (Revelation 17:4, 5)

Slide 7 Term Definition: Woman in Prophecy

In Scripture, a woman represents a church:
*   **A Pure Woman:** Represents God's faithful people (Jeremiah 6:2).
*   **A Corrupt Woman (Harlot):** Represents a church that has been unfaithful to God.

Slide 8 Prophetic Insight

[SN] Prophetic tangents:
*   The colors purple (royalty) and scarlet (sin/blood) contrast with the white linen (righteousness of saints) found elsewhere in Revelation.
*   The title "Mother" implies she has "daughters"—other religious bodies that resemble her character.

Slide 9 Question: What constitutes the "fornication" or unfaithfulness of the church?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking conflicted between a Bible and worldly riches.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?” (James 4:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle James preaching earnestly to a gathering of people.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Spiritual adultery occurs when the church seeks the friendship of the world rather than relying on Christ.

This "falling away" happens when the church:
*   Adopts worldly customs.
*   Seeks political power.
*   Dilutes the Bible to gain popularity.

Slide 12 Illustration: The Ship

[ILL] Imagine a ship. It is designed to be in the ocean, but the ocean must not get into the ship. If a ship has "rotten timbers," it will sink. Similarly, when the church allows the "world" to leak into its doctrines, it loses its spiritual buoyancy and falls.

---

Slide 13 Question: Does this "fall" apply only to the mother church, or does it extend to others?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large family tree or lineage, showing connections between branches.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: If the mother is corrupt, the daughters who mimic her traits are also implicated.

Many denominations, though stepping out of Rome, retained "elements of Romanism"—such as relying on clerical interpretation rather than teaching the people the Bible in its purity.

Slide 15 Historical Context

[DYK] In the 19th century, many evangelical leaders confessed that "apostasy is engraved on the very front of every church" because they had become lovers of the world and respectability rather than lovers of cross-bearing.

Slide 16 Question: How does the Apostle Paul describe this spiritual condition in the last days?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul writing a letter by candlelight in a prison cell.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd of people dressed finely for worship but looking bored and distracted.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The "Form" vs. The "Power"

The "fall" of Babylon results in a religion that looks correct on the outside ("a form of godliness") but lacks the life-changing power of the Holy Spirit. It is a system built on social fashion rather than spiritual regeneration.

Slide 19 Question: What is God’s command to His sincere people who are currently inside these fallen systems?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bright light breaking through heavy storm clouds.

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, My people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.” (Revelation 18:4)

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: A Call of Mercy

This verse proves that God has many true, faithful people *inside* the systems of Babylon. He does not condemn the individuals, but the system. His call to "come out" is an act of mercy, guiding them to safety.

Slide 22 The Three Angels' Progression

[SN]
*   **1st Angel:** Announces the Judgment is come.
*   **2nd Angel:** Exposes the condition of the religious world (Babylon) as unfit for that judgment.
*   **3rd Angel:** Provides the remedy and the destination for those who come out.

Slide 23 Question: What is the "remedy" or the destination for those who come out of Babylon?

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ten Commandments tablets illuminated by a soft, divine light.

Slide 25 Practical Application

The Second Angel invites us to examine our lives:
*   Are we relying on human interpretations or studying the Bible for ourselves?
*   Have we allowed the "friendship of the world" to dilute our walk with God?

God invites us to stand on the firm foundation of His Commandments and the faith of Jesus.
