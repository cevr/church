---

Slide 1 Question: Can sin exist without a law?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression.” (Romans 4:15)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible defines sin as the transgression (breaking) of the law (1 John 3:4). Therefore, if the Bible records sin existing before the Ten Commandments were given at Mount Sinai, it implies that God’s moral law was already in force.

Slide 4 Question: How early in history did sin and the violation of God’s law begin?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning.” (1 John 3:8) “God spared not the angels that sinned...” (2 Peter 2:4)

Slide 6 Progressive Disclosure:
• Sin began with Lucifer (the Devil) before humanity existed.
• Angels were held accountable for sin.
• Therefore, the standard of God's government (His Law) existed in heaven before it was written on stone on earth.

Slide 7 Illustration: The Law of Gravity

[ILL] Consider the law of gravity. It existed and functioned long before Isaac Newton wrote down the mathematical formula. Similarly, God's moral law existed and governed the universe long before Moses wrote it on tablets of stone.

Slide 8 Question: Did the first generations of humans know the difference between right and wrong?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve’s family working the land outside of Eden, with a serious, contemplative atmosphere.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door... And he [God] said... the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.” (Genesis 4:7-10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two altars in a field, one with smoke rising clearly, the other with smoke drifting low, portraying the story of Cain and Abel.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: In the story of Cain and Abel, God warns Cain that "sin lies at the door." When Cain murdered his brother, God held him accountable. Cain could not be guilty of sin if there was no law against murder.

Slide 11 Term Definition: Patriarchal Age

**Definition**: The period of biblical history from Creation until the giving of the Law at Sinai (covering Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob). This study demonstrates that moral obligation was binding during this entire era.

Slide 12 Question: By what standard were the people before the Flood and in Sodom judged?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast, ancient city gate, with people conducting business, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: [Regarding Noah] “And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness.” (2 Peter 2:5)
[Regarding Lot] “And delivered just Lot... for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.” (2 Peter 2:7, 8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Noah standing faithfully beside the timber structure of the ark while people in the background continue their lives.

---

Slide 14 Deeper Insight: Lot was vexed by "unlawful" deeds. You cannot have an "unlawful" deed unless there is a law. Furthermore, Noah preached "righteousness" (right-doing), which presupposes a standard of right and wrong.

[DYK] The word "righteousness" in the Bible essentially means "acting in accordance with a standard." In a biblical context, that standard is always the character and will of God, expressed in His law.

Slide 15 Question: Did the patriarchs specifically know and keep God’s commandments?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elderly Abraham standing under a night sky filled with stars, looking reverent.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws.” (Genesis 26:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham building an altar of stone, soft golden light illuminating his hands.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: This is one of the most powerful verses regarding the pre-Sinai law. Centuries before Moses, God commends Abraham for keeping His "commandments, statutes, and laws."

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent: The Great Controversy Context**
The fact that Abraham kept God's "statutes" suggests a revealed system of worship and morality passed down from Adam. This connects to the broader "Great Controversy" theme—Satan's claim is often that God's law cannot be kept. Abraham's life (the father of the faithful) stands as a witness that through faith, humanity could walk in harmony with God's eternal law.

Slide 18 Question: How did Joseph react when tempted to commit adultery in Egypt?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Joseph in an Egyptian palace setting, looking away from a figure in the shadows, expression resolute.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “How then, can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Joseph standing alone in a grand Egyptian hall, light highlighting his face as he looks upward for strength.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Joseph, living in a pagan culture without a written Bible, knew that adultery was not just a social error, but a "great wickedness" and a "sin against God." The moral law was written on his conscience and revered in his life.

Slide 21 Question: Who are the true heirs of this faith today?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people from different eras standing together, united by a soft, heavenly light.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:29) “If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.” (John 8:39)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ placing a hand on the shoulder of a believer, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 23 Practical Application:
• God’s Law is not merely Jewish; it is eternal and universal.
• Like Abraham, we are saved by faith, and that faith leads us to obey God’s voice.
• Like Joseph, we should recognize sin as an offense against God, regardless of the culture around us.

---

Slide 24 Final Thought: The moral law is an expression of God’s character. Since God does not change, His moral requirements remain the same from the beginning of the world to the end.
