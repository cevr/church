Study Title: Reverence for the House of God

---

Slide 1 Question: How does the Lord regard things or places that have been dedicated to His service?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.” (Leviticus 27:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ark of the Covenant bathed in a holy, separated light, distinct from the surrounding shadows.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: When something is "devoted" to God, its status changes from common (ordinary) to holy (set apart). It is no longer to be treated with the same casualness as everyday objects.

---

Slide 4 Deeper Insight: This principle applies to the church building, the tithe, and the time set apart for worship.

[DYK] The Hebrew word often used for things devoted to God implies a separation so complete that the object cannot be redeemed for personal use again. It belongs exclusively to the Divine.

Slide 5 Question: How did Jesus demonstrate the sanctity of God’s house during His earthly ministry?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing at the entrance of the Temple colonnades, looking with concern at the busy marketplace scene.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple... And He taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.” (Mark 11:15-17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus firmly overturning a table of money, coins scattering, with a look of righteous zeal rather than uncontrolled anger.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Jesus took immediate action to clear the temple of commercial traffic. He re-established the building's true purpose: not a place for transaction or profit, but a place for communion with the Father.

[ILL] Imagine inviting a guest to your home, but the living room is so full of noisy vendors that your guest cannot sit down or hear you speak. This is what the religious leaders had done to God’s house.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Temple interior now cleared and quiet, with shafts of sunlight illuminating a peaceful space for prayer.

---

Slide 8 Question: Was the sanctity of the "House of God" intended only for the Jewish people?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of travelers from different nations approaching the Temple mount at sunset.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “For mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.” (Isaiah 56:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people in various ethnic robes kneeling together in prayer within a grand stone courtyard.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: God’s design has always been inclusive. The sanctity of His house is a gift to "all nations." Even the "sons of the stranger" are invited to find joy in His house of prayer.

[SN] Spirit-led insight: The buying and selling Jesus stopped was taking place in the "Court of the Gentiles"—the *only* place non-Jews could pray. By filling it with livestock, the priests were blocking the Gentiles' access to God. Jesus’ zeal was for the people being shut out.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Gentile looking longingly through a barrier, seeing only livestock where there should be space to pray.

---

Slide 11 Question: What makes a gathering or a place holy today?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small group of believers gathered in a humble room, their faces illuminated by a central, warm glow.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” (Matthew 18:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting a faint, spiritual outline of Christ standing among a small group of praying disciples.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: While brick and mortar are dedicated to God, true holiness comes from the presence of Christ. If He is present, the ground becomes holy, just as it did for Moses at the burning bush.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses removing his sandals before the burning bush, light reflecting on his reverent face.

---

Slide 14 Question: If Christ is present, how should we conduct ourselves?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person pausing at a grand temple threshold, adjusting their robe and bowing their head in preparation to enter.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God.” (Ecclesiastes 5:1); “Serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” (Hebrews 12:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a worshiper walking slowly and deliberately on a stone pavement, eyes cast downward in respect.

---

Slide 16 Term Definition: **"Keep thy foot"**

This is an idiom meaning "watch your step" or "proceed with caution." It implies preparing one’s heart before entering, leaving worldly distractions outside, and entering with a focus on listening to God.

[ILL] When entering a courtroom or a royal palace, our demeanor changes naturally—we lower our voices and show respect. How much more should we do this when entering the presence of the King of Kings?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a subject entering a throne room, posture humble and attentive before a King on a distant throne.

---

Slide 17 Question: What creates a proper atmosphere for worship?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King David playing a harp in the sanctuary, his expression a mix of joy and solemnity.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.” (Psalm 5:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure with arms raised gently, bathed in light, symbolizing the reception of mercy.

---

Slide 19 Progressive Disclosure: The Elements of Reverence

*   **Recognition of God’s Mercy:** (Grace)
*   **A Sense of Holy Fear:** (Awe)
*   **Direction of the Heart:** (Focus)

We do not tremble in terror because of His mercy, but we do not act casually because of His majesty.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scale balancing a heart on one side and a crown on the other, representing love and awe.

Slide 20 Spirit-Led Connections

[SN] Optional tangent:
*   Leviticus 19:30 connects "Reverence My sanctuary" with "Keep My Sabbaths." Time (Sabbath) and Space (Sanctuary) are twin cathedrals of God's presence.
*   Our behavior in church reflects our understanding of Christ's ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two pillars standing side by side, one glowing with the light of the Sabbath, the other representing the Temple structure.

---

Slide 21 Practical Application: How can we show reverence this week?

*   Arriving on time to compose our hearts.
*   Refraining from secular conversation in the sanctuary.
*   Dressing in a way that honors the Host.
*   Teaching children that church is a special place to meet Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family walking together toward a church door, the father gently guiding a child, faces peaceful and expectant.
