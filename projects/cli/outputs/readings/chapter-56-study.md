Study Title: The Seven Last Plagues: God’s Final Judgment

Question: What warning is given regarding those who worship the beast and receive his mark?

Biblical Answer: “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

Explanation: The "wrath of God" is here defined as the seven last plagues (Revelation 15:1). The phrase "without mixture" is fearful; heretofore, all judgments have been mixed with mercy. Here, mercy is no longer present because the time of salvation has passed.

[DYK] In the ancient sanctuary service, the High Priest interceded for the people. When his work was finished, he left the sanctuary. Revelation 15:8 describes the temple being filled with smoke so that "no man was able to enter," signifying that Christ’s intercessory work in the heavenly temple has ceased.

Question: When does the time of probation close?

Biblical Answer: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still... And, behold, I come quickly.” (Revelation 22:11, 12)

Explanation: This decree goes forth *before* Christ returns. It indicates a specific moment when human character is fixed forever. Just as the door of the ark was shut days before the flood waters fell, probation closes before the plagues begin.

[ILL] Consider the days of Noah. The door was shut while the sky was still clear. Those outside could not enter, even though the rain had not yet started. Similarly, there will be a period after intercession ceases, but before Christ appears, where no one’s spiritual condition can be changed.

Question: What is the nature of the first three plagues?

Biblical Answer:
1. **Upon the Earth:** “A noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast.” (Revelation 16:2)
2. **Upon the Sea:** “It became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)
3. **Upon Rivers and Fountains:** “And they became blood.” (Revelation 16:4)

Deeper Insight: Why blood? The angel of the waters declares, “For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy” (Revelation 16:6). This is an act of strict retributive justice against those who persecuted God’s people.

Question: How do the subsequent plagues affect the heavens and the seat of the beast?

Biblical Answer:
4. **The Sun:** “Power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.” (Revelation 16:8)
5. **The Seat of the Beast:** “His kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain.” (Revelation 16:10)

Term Definition: "Seat of the beast" refers to the center of authority and power of the antichrist power. Even in the midst of scorching heat, this specific power is plunged into supernatural darkness.

[SN] It is worthy of note that during the plagues of Egypt, there was light in the dwellings of Israel while darkness covered Egypt (Exodus 10:23). A similar distinction is made in the end times. While the wicked suffer, God is a refuge for His people.

Question: What promise is given to the righteous during this time of trouble?

Biblical Answer: “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee... neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.” (Psalm 91:7, 10)

Explanation: While the world shakes, God’s people are protected. Joel 3:16 confirms that while the heavens and earth shake, “the Lord will be the hope of His people.”

Question: What events occur under the final two plagues?

Biblical Answer:
6. **The Euphrates:** “The water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared.” (Revelation 16:12)
7. **The Air:** A great voice says, “It is done.” (Revelation 16:17). This is followed by a mighty earthquake and great hail, “every stone about the weight of a talent.” (Revelation 16:18, 21)

[DYK] A "talent" in biblical weights could range from 50 to 100 pounds (roughly 22 to 45 kg). Hailstones of this magnitude represent total destruction of earthly structures.

Question: What is the result for those who rejected the warning message?

Biblical Answer: “I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord... they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.” (Amos 8:11-12)

Progressive Disclosure:
1. God sends the Third Angel’s Message as a final warning.
2. Those who reject it eventually face the close of probation.
3. When the plagues fall, they desperately seek God’s word for relief.
4. It is too late; the "Master of the house... hath shut to the door" (Luke 13:25).

Practical Application: The Third Angel’s Message is the last special call to this generation. We are currently in the time of "hearing." How are we treating the Word of God today, while the door of mercy remains open?
