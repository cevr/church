Slide 3 Explanation: The Ten Commandments define our duty to God and to man. The fifth commandment, regarding parents, acts as a bridge between the two. The Apostle Paul notes that this is the first command in the list that includes a specific incentive for keeping it.

Slide 6 Did You Know? [DYK] In the culture of the Bible, the family was the center of religious training and education. To honor one's parents was to respect the structure God established for passing down wisdom and faith.

---

Slide 7 Word Study: “Honor” (Hebrew *kabad*) literally means to be heavy or weighty.

To honor parents means to treat them with weight, significance, and high value, rather than treating them lightly or disrespectfully.

Slide 8 Question: What does God promise to teach children who listen (hearken) to Him?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of children sitting in a semi-circle, looking up attentively at a teacher.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” (Psalm 34:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King David playing a harp, surrounded by attentive young listeners.

---

Slide 10 Question: What is the "fear of the Lord"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man kneeling in a vast temple, looking up in awe at a shaft of divine light.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments.” (Psalm 111:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scribe writing carefully on parchment, an expression of deep contemplation on his face.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Biblical "fear" in this context does not mean being terrified of God. It refers to a deep, reverential awe and respect. It is recognizing God as the supreme Authority. True wisdom begins when we acknowledge God's position and submit to His guidance through obedience.

---

Slide 13 Illustration [ILL]: Think of a traveler on a steep mountain trail following an expert guide. The traveler has a healthy "fear" or respect for the guide's instructions, not because the guide is mean, but because the guide knows the safe path. Ignoring the guide is foolish; following him is wisdom.

Slide 14 Question: How does God view a young person who is wise, compared to a powerful leader who refuses to learn?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting contrasting a humble youth in simple clothes with an old king in rich robes looking stubborn.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.” (Ecclesiastes 4:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crown gathering dust on a table, while a simple shepherd's staff glows with light nearby.

---

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Wisdom in Scripture is not about age or status; it is about a teachable spirit ("admonished"). A child who listens to God is spiritually superior to a king who thinks he knows everything.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a young Samuel listening intently in the temple, soft light illuminating his face.

---

Slide 17 Question: How did Jesus demonstrate His feelings toward children?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting on a stone, smiling as children run toward Him.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 19:14)

“And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them.” (Mark 10:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding a small child in His arms, with other children gathering around His knees.

---

Slide 19 Term Definition: “Suffer” in older English means "to allow" or "to permit."

The disciples tried to send the children away, thinking they were bothering the Master. Jesus corrected them, showing that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those with the humble, trusting heart of a child.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of disciples looking surprised as Jesus gestures for the children to come closer.

---

Slide 20 Speaker's Note [SN]: This scene reveals the character of God. In ancient societies, children were often marginalized or seen as having low status. Jesus elevated them, showing that God’s love is not based on what we can produce or achieve, but on our willingness to come to Him.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on the gentle hand of Jesus resting on a child's head, symbolizing blessing and acceptance.

---

Slide 21 Question: Since Jesus is in Heaven now, how can we receive His blessing today?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beam of light connecting the heavens to a person kneeling on earth.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” (Matthew 21:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family kneeling together in prayer, their faces illuminated by a central candle.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: We can no longer physically climb into Jesus' arms, but we access His presence through the medium of prayer. Faith ("believing") is the hand that reaches out to receive God's gifts.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands reached out open toward the sky, receiving intangible light.

---

Slide 24 Question: What is the ultimate promise for those who keep God’s commandments?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of pearl gates opening to reveal a city of golden light.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Revelation 22:14)

Slide 26 Progressive Disclosure:
• Obedience leads to blessing.
• Access is restored to what was lost in Eden (the Tree of Life).
• Entrance is granted into the New Jerusalem.

---

Slide 27 Deeper Insight: This verse connects the end of the Bible with the beginning. In Genesis, humanity was barred from the Tree of Life because of disobedience. In Revelation, humanity is restored to the Tree of Life through faith and obedience. The law of God and the grace of God work together to restore His family.

---

Slide 28 Speaker's Note [SN]: Early Adventists emphasized that the "Commandments" in Revelation 22:14 are the standard of judgment and the evidence of a transformed heart. It is fitting that the last promise in the Bible concerns the keeping of God's law, ensuring an eternity of peace and order.

---

Slide 29 Practical Application: How can we claim these promises today?

• Show respect to parents and elders.
• Cultivate a teachable spirit.
• Do not be afraid to come to Jesus in prayer, no matter your age.
• Value obedience to God’s law as the path to life.
