Study Title: The Home of the Saved: The Lost Dominion Restored

Question: For what specific purpose did God create the earth?

Biblical Answer: “For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it... He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.” (Isaiah 45:18)

Explanation: God does nothing without purpose. The earth was not designed to be a wasteland or a place of suffering; it was meticulously crafted to be a home for His children.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "in vain" here is *tohu*, the same word used in Genesis 1:2 ("without form"). God did not create the earth to remain chaotic; He formed it specifically to sustain life and relationship.

Question: Who was originally given authority (dominion) over the earth?

Biblical Answer: “Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou has put all things under His feet.” (Psalm 8:6; see also Genesis 1:26)

Explanation: At Creation, Adam was appointed as the steward and ruler of the world. He was to govern the earth in harmony with God’s will.

Question: Does humanity currently possess this full dominion?

Biblical Answer: “But now we see not yet all things put under him.” (Hebrews 2:8)

Explanation: While humanity was designed to rule, we clearly do not control the chaos, death, and suffering in the world today. The dominion was lost.

Question: How was this dominion lost, and who holds it now?

Biblical Answer: “For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.” (2 Peter 2:19)

Refining the Answer: When Adam yielded to Satan’s temptation in Eden, he surrendered his allegiance—and consequently his dominion—to the adversary.

[ILL] Imagine a king who voluntarily hands over the keys of his kingdom to an invader. Though the king (Adam) was the legal ruler, the invader (Satan) became the "de facto" ruler by conquest.

Question: How do we know Satan currently claims possession of the world?

Biblical Answer: “And the Devil said unto Him [Jesus], All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto Me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it.” (Luke 4:6)

Explanation: This occurred during the temptation in the wilderness. The text notes that this glory was "delivered" to Satan—surrendered by Adam.

[SN] It is significant that Jesus did not dispute Satan's claim to be the "prince of this world" at that moment. Jesus came not to dispute the claim with words, but to reconquer the territory through His sacrifice.

Question: Will the "first dominion" ever be restored?

Biblical Answer: “And thou, O tower of the flock... unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion...” (Micah 4:8)

Explanation: The "first dominion" refers to the rule Adam lost in Eden. The prophecy promises its return to the "tower of the flock," a title for the Messiah.

Term Definition: **The Meek.** In Matthew 5:5, Jesus says, "Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth." The inheritance is not for the aggressive or the proud who conquer by force, but for those who wait upon the Lord (Psalm 37:34).

Question: Who is the true heir of the promise made to Abraham regarding the world?

Biblical Answer: “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” (Galatians 3:16)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **The Promise:** Abraham was promised the world (Romans 4:13).
2.  **The Reality:** Abraham died without owning a foot of it (Acts 7:5).
3.  **The Hope:** He looked for a city built by God (Hebrews 11:10).
4.  **The Solution:** Christ is the true Seed. If we belong to Christ, we become heirs of this promise (Galatians 3:29).

Question: Before the righteous inherit the earth, what must happen to the current world?

Biblical Answer: “The heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10)

Explanation: Fire will purify the earth of the curse of sin. It is a cleansing process to prepare for renovation.

Question: What follows this purification?

Biblical Answer: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13; see also Isaiah 65:17)

Deeper Insight: The "New Earth" is not a disembodied spiritual cloud-land. It is this earth, restored to its Edenic perfection. The home of the saved will be a tangible, physical reality where righteousness dwells.

Question: What will life look like in the New Earth?

Biblical Answer: “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together... They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain.” (Isaiah 65:25) “And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs... and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35:10)

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the complete reversal of the curse. In Eden, sin brought fear between man and beast, and sorrow to the heart. In the New Earth, nature is at peace (wolf/lamb) and the heart is at peace (sorrow flees). It is Eden restored, but more glorious because God dwells visibly with His people.

Practical Application:
*   **Patience:** Like Abraham, we may not see our reward in this life. We are "sojourners" here.
*   **Identity:** Our inheritance is tied to Christ. Are we His?
*   **Hope:** The chaos of the current world is temporary. The rightful King is coming to restore the dominion.
