Study Title: Perfection of Character: Growing in Grace

---

Slide 1 Question: What is the natural condition of humanity?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For all men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of people turning away from a bright, divine light, soft shadows emphasizing separation.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The starting point of the gospel is realizing that humanity naturally falls short of God’s ideal. We are not merely undeveloped; we are separated from the "glory"—the character and presence—of God.

---

Slide 4 Question: How can a person’s nature be changed?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter reshaping a clay vessel on a wheel, soft light highlighting the new form emerging.

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise breaking over an ancient landscape, banishing the shadows of night.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: This change is not a renovation, but a re-creation. When one is "in Christ," the old life of selfishness ceases to be the ruling power. A new life, motivated by the Spirit, begins.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fresh green shoot growing out of dry, cracked earth, soft light focusing on the new life.

---

Slide 7 Illustration: Consider a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. It does not merely improve its crawling technique; it undergoes a metamorphosis into a completely different creature with new abilities and a new nature.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting style interpretation of a beautiful butterfly resting on a vine, soft light highlighting its wings.

---

Slide 8 Question: What distinguishes the "old life" from the "new life"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two trees: one withered and dry, the other lush and heavy with fruit.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest... But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Galatians 5:19-23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a basket overflowing with grapes, pomegranates, and figs, bathed in gentle, warm light.

---

Slide 10 Comparison:
**Works of the Flesh:** Suggests labor, struggle, and the grinding effort of human nature.
**Fruit of the Spirit:** Suggests a natural, organic byproduct of being connected to the Life-giver.

[DYK] The Greek word for "fruit" here is singular, not plural. While there are many attributes (love, joy, peace), they are all one cluster—the singular fruit of a life filled with the Holy Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single branch of a grapevine holding a heavy, unified cluster of grapes.

---

Slide 11 Question: Is the concept of "perfection" or maturity taught in the Bible?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master craftsman examining a finished work with approval, soft light.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting [lacking] nothing.” (James 1:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a strong, fully grown olive tree standing firm in a field, portraying maturity and completeness.

---

Slide 13 Definition: **"Perfect"** (*teleios*).
In the New Testament, this often means "mature," "complete," or "reaching the goal." It implies a heart that is undivided in loyalty to God and fully mature in love, rather than absolute freedom from mistakes in knowledge.

---

Slide 14 Question: How does a believer grow toward this maturity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stone staircase ascending toward a bright temple, each step clearly defined.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; ... temperance; ... patience; ... godliness; ... brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.” (2 Peter 1:5-7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll with a list of virtues written in ancient script, illuminated by candlelight.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: This is "Peter's Ladder." Salvation is a free gift, but character building requires "all diligence." We cooperate with God by actively adding these graces to our lives through His strength.

[SN] Spirit-led Insight: Ellen White often wrote about the "ladder of Christian progress." Notice that the ladder begins with **Faith** (the root) and ends with **Charity** (Love—the fruit). This mirrors the path of Christ.

---

Slide 17 Question: What role does the Bible play in this growth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open Bible on a wooden table, sunlight streaming across the pages.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.” (1 Peter 2:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a mother gently feeding a newborn infant, portraying dependence and growth.

---

Slide 19 Question: How deeply should we internalize God’s Word?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person deeply engrossed in reading a scroll, their face reflecting contemplation.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.” (Jeremiah 15:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple meal of bread and wine on a table, symbolizing spiritual sustenance.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Reading the Bible is compared to eating. Just as food must be digested to become part of our blood and bone, Scripture must be meditated upon until it shapes our very character.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd watching his flock while meditating, soft evening light.

---

Slide 22 Question: Alongside the Word, what is necessary for building character?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling by a window, hands clasped in prayer, looking toward the sky.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.” (Jude 20)

[ILL] Prayer and the Word are like the two lungs of the spiritual life. To breathe in, we receive God's voice through His Word; to breathe out, we respond in prayer. If either stops, spiritual life suffocates.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing with arms outstretched in an open field, breathing in the fresh air, soft light.

---

Slide 24 Question: What is the ultimate goal Christ has for His people?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bride adorned in white standing before a groom, portrayed with reverence and purity.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle... but that it should be holy and without blemish.” (Ephesians 5:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pristine white linen garment, glowing with purity, without a single stain.

---

Slide 26 Deeper Insight: The "spot" represents defilement from sin (outside), while the "wrinkle" represents signs of decay or aging (inside). Christ intends to present a church that is both pure and eternally spiritually youthful.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a congregation of people in white robes, their faces full of vitality and youthfulness.

---

Slide 27 Question: Can we trust God to complete this work in us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a strong hand holding a smaller, weaker hand, symbolizing guidance and security.

---

Slide 28 Biblical Answer: “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

[DYK] This verse affirms the holistic nature of humanity. We are not just floating spirits; our physical habits ("body"), mental faculties ("soul"), and spiritual connection ("spirit") are all to be sanctified.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing whole and dignified, surrounded by a peaceful, divine aura.

---

Slide 29 Practical Application: Cooperating with God
1. **Identify** habits that need to pass away.
2. **Feed** on the Word daily through meditation.
3. **Pray** specifically for the "Fruit of the Spirit."
4. **Trust** the "God of peace" to sanctify you.
