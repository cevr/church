Study Title: Examining the First Day in the New Testament

---

Slide 1 Question: How does the Gospel of Matthew identify the day before the resurrection?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.” (Matthew 28:1)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The text clearly distinguishes between the “Sabbath” and the “first day of the week” (Sunday). Even though Matthew wrote this Gospel approximately six years after the resurrection, he did not apply any sacred title to the first day; he simply called it the first day of the week.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The Gospels were written years after the events they record: Matthew (~6 years), Mark (~32 years), Luke (~24 years), and John (~60+ years later). In all four accounts, the writers—inspired by the Holy Spirit—consistently call the seventh day "the Sabbath" and Sunday merely "the first day."

Slide 5 Question: How did Jesus' followers observe the Sabbath while He rested in the tomb?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.” (Luke 23:56)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The holy women, who loved Jesus deeply, would not even embalm His body on the Sabbath. They waited until the Sabbath was past to perform this labor of love.

Slide 8 Term Definition: “According to the commandment” refers to the Fourth Commandment (Exodus 20:8-11), which requires resting from labor on the seventh day.

Slide 9 Question: When the disciples met on the evening of the resurrection, was it a religious celebration?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the disciples gathered in a room, looking anxious and huddled together, shadows casting across their faces.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst...” (John 20:19)

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The text states they were assembled “for fear of the Jews,” not for worship. Mark 16:11-14 reveals they did not yet believe He had risen. When Jesus arrived, they were eating a common meal of fish and honey (Luke 24:42), not celebrating the Lord’s Supper.

[ILL] If a group of people lock themselves in a room because they are afraid of being arrested or attacked, we would not call that a public church service. It is a hiding place.

Slide 12 Question: Does the meeting in Acts 20 establish Sunday as a holy day?

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.” (Acts 20:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a night scene looking into an upper window, where a gathering is illuminated by warm lamplight against the dark night sky.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: This was a farewell meeting held at night. Since biblical days begin at sundown, a meeting on the "first day" that goes until midnight would actually be Saturday night. The text notes that at daybreak (Sunday morning), Paul departed.

[SN] The phrase "break bread" (Acts 20:7) does not exclusively prove a religious service. Acts 2:46 tells us the early disciples broke bread "daily" from house to house. Therefore, breaking bread does not make a day holy.

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: Paul walked approximately nineteen miles to Assos on that Sunday morning (Acts 20:13). A faithful follower of Christ would not have spent a "holy day" walking a nineteen-mile journey. To Paul, the first day was a day for travel and labor.

Slide 16 Question: Does Paul’s instruction to the Corinthians suggest a weekly Sunday collection service?

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Upon the first day of the week let everyone of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.” (1 Corinthians 16:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man sitting at a table in his home, quietly counting coins and placing them into a small chest.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The instruction is to "lay by him in store." In the original Greek context, this implies setting something aside at home (privately), examining one's own finances at the start of the week. The purpose was to have the total ready so that no collection would need to be taken when Paul arrived.

Slide 19 Question: Since the New Testament does not call Sunday the "Lord's Day," which day is the true Lord's Day?

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day...” (Revelation 1:10) compare with “The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking through a grain field, looking compassionate and regal, asserting His authority.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Revelation mentions the "Lord's day" but doesn't identify it. To find the definition, we must look to the rest of Scripture. Jesus explicitly claimed to be Lord of the Sabbath. In Isaiah 58:13, God calls the Sabbath "My holy day." There is no scripture that calls the first day the "Lord's day."

Slide 22 Summary:
1. The Sabbath is God's day (Isa 58:13)
2. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28)
3. Therefore, the Lord's Day is the Sabbath.

---

Slide 23 Practical Application: The New Testament mentions the first day of the week eight times. In every instance, it is treated as a common working day. We are called to follow the example of Jesus and the Apostles, who respected the commandments of God above the traditions of men.
