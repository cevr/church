Study Title: The World's Condition Before the Kingdom

Question: How did Jesus describe the moral condition of the world just before His return?

Biblical Answer: “And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26) “And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” (Genesis 6:5)

Explanation: Jesus draws a direct parallel between the antediluvian world and the end of time. The characteristics of Noah’s day—widespread wickedness and a preoccupation with earthly life while ignoring God’s warnings—will be repeated.

[DYK] The "days of Noah" were not marked by ignorance, but by rebellion. Ancient traditions and archaeological hints suggest high intellect and skill, yet these were used for evil rather than for God’s glory.

Question: Will society improve as we approach the end, or will times become more difficult?

Biblical Answer: “This know, also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.” (2 Timothy 3:1) “But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.” (2 Timothy 3:13)

Explanation: Contrary to the idea that humanity will evolve into a state of moral perfection, Scripture predicts "perilous times." The text lists specific moral failures: selfishness, pride, disobedience to parents, and a lack of natural affection.

[ILL] Imagine a boat drifting down a river. Without an anchor or an engine fighting the current, it naturally drifts downstream, not up. Similarly, without the direct intervention of God, the "current" of fallen human nature drifts toward lawlessness, not holiness.

Term Definition: “Form of Godliness” (2 Tim 3:5) refers to outward religious observance—going to church, using spiritual language, or keeping rituals—without the transformational power of the Holy Spirit in the heart.

Question: Will the whole world eventually be converted before Jesus returns?

Biblical Answer: “Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares... but gather the wheat into my barn.” (Matthew 13:30)

Explanation: The parable of the wheat and tares teaches that good (wheat) and evil (tares) will coexist until the very end. The separation does not happen through a gradual conversion of the tares into wheat, but through a decisive act of judgment at the "harvest" (the end of the world).

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** Note that the "Little Horn" (Daniel 7) and the "Man of Sin" (2 Thessalonians 2) continue their work until the very moment Christ appears. They are not converted by the gospel but are destroyed by the "brightness of His coming." This refutes the "Post-Millennial" view that the world will enjoy 1,000 years of peace before Christ returns.

Question: There is a popular teaching that nations will voluntarily lay down their weapons. How does Scripture distinguish between what people *say* and what God *predicts*?

Biblical Answer:
*What many say:* “Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord... and they shall beat their swords into plowshares...” (Micah 4:2-3)
*What God warns:* “Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war... beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruninghooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.” (Joel 3:9-10)

Explanation: This is a vital distinction. In Micah, the text describes what "many nations shall come and say." It reflects a human hope for a man-made golden age. However, Joel records God’s direct command to the nations to prepare for the final conflict. The reality of the last days is not universal peace, but preparation for the final battle.

Question: If the world is not going to be converted, what is the true hope of the Church?

Biblical Answer: “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)

Explanation: The Christian’s hope is not fixed on political reform or a utopia established by human hands. It is fixed on the literal, personal return of Jesus Christ. He is the one who breaks the nations "with a rod of iron" (Psalm 2:9) and establishes true righteousness.

[ILL] A lighthouse does not stop the storm from raging, but it provides a focus point for the ship to reach the harbor safely. The "Blessed Hope" of Christ's return is our lighthouse in the midst of a darkening world.

Deeper Insight: The text mentions that the wicked cry "Peace and safety" just before destruction comes (1 Thess 5:3). This suggests that right before the end, there may be a global illusion of security or a counterfeit peace that blinds many to the reality of the coming Judgment.

Practical Application: Since we know the world will face "perilous times" and deception:
1.  Are we holding to the "power" of godliness, or just the "form"?
2.  Are we looking for earthly security, or is our focus on the "Blessed Hope"?
3.  Are we prepared to stand as "wheat" even when surrounded by "tares"?
