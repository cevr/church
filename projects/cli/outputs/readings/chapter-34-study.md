Study Title: The Mystery of a Sinless Life

Question: What testimony does Scripture give regarding the moral character of Jesus Christ?

Biblical Answer: “Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.” (1 Peter 2:22)

Explanation: While the Bible states clearly that “all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23), Jesus stands as the solitary exception. He challenged His own enemies to find a flaw in Him, asking, “Which of you convinceth Me of sin?” (John 8:46), and they could find none.

Term Definition: “Guile” refers to deceit, cunning, or trickery. To have no guile means to be transparent, honest, and authentically pure in speech and intent.

[DYK] In the Old Testament sacrificial system, a lamb had to be “without blemish” to be accepted (Exodus 12:5). Peter uses this imagery to show that Jesus is the perfect fulfillment of that symbol—spiritually spotless.

Question: Was Jesus’ sinlessness due to an inability to be tempted, or did He face the same struggles we do?

Biblical Answer: “[He] was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.” (Hebrews 4:15)

Explanation: Jesus was not immune to the struggle; He felt the full weight of temptation just as we do. The difference was not in the *temptation*, but in the *response*. He remained sinless not because He couldn't sin, but because He chose not to.

[ILL] A strong wind blows against both a solid rock and a falling leaf. The leaf moves immediately, but the rock resists. The rock actually feels the force of the wind *more* than the leaf because it does not yield. Jesus, by resisting every temptation, felt the full weight of sin’s pressure more than any human ever has.

Question: How fully did Jesus enter into our human experience?

Biblical Answer: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same... Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren...” (Hebrews 2:14, 17)

Explanation: Jesus did not merely look human; He took upon Himself our actual nature—“flesh and blood.” He entered the human family so He could be a “merciful and faithful high priest.” He understands our weakness because He has lived inside it.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The nature of Christ during the Incarnation is a profound mystery. Historic Adventist theology emphasizes that Christ took upon Himself the nature of man *after* the fall—meaning He inherited the innocent infirmities and weaknesses of humanity (hunger, fatigue, the capacity to die), yet He possessed a sinless character. He met sin on its own territory—the flesh—and conquered it there.

Question: What did God accomplish through Christ taking on "sinful flesh"?

Biblical Answer: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” (Romans 8:3)

Explanation: The law can point out sin, but it cannot fix it because our flesh is weak. Jesus came into that same weak flesh and “condemned sin.” He proved that it is possible, through the Spirit, to live in human flesh and yet not serve sin.

Question: If Jesus was human, by what power did He live this perfect life?

Biblical Answer: “I can of Mine own self do nothing.” (John 5:30) “The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doth the works.” (John 14:10)

Explanation: This is the secret of the sinless life. Jesus did not use His own divine power to save Himself or to make His life easier. He lived as a man, totally dependent on the Father. He exercised faith, prayer, and surrender, showing us exactly how we are to live.

[ILL] Imagine a glove. A glove cannot pick up a book by itself. But if a hand fills the glove, the glove moves and works. Jesus, in His humanity, was the vessel; the Father, through the Spirit, provided the power. He invites us to be filled with that same Spirit.

Question: What was the singular purpose that drove Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “For I came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me.” (John 6:38)

Progressive Disclosure: • Surrender of self • Alignment with God’s law • Trust in the Father’s plan

Deeper Insight: The essence of sin is selfishness—doing “mine own will.” The essence of righteousness is love and submission—doing the "will of Him that sent Me." Jesus lived a life of total self-renunciation.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: Consider the contrast with Lucifer. Lucifer said, "I will ascend," "I will be like the Most High" (Isaiah 14). Jesus said, "I can of Mine own self do nothing," and "Not my will, but Thine be done." The Great Controversy is a battle between the principle of Self-Exaltation and the principle of Self-Sacrificing Love.

Practical Application: How does Christ's sinless life help us today?
1.  **Confidence:** We have a High Priest who truly understands our struggles.
2.  **Example:** He showed that victory over temptation is possible through dependence on God.
3.  **Hope:** Since He conquered sin in the flesh, He can conquer sin in *our* flesh today.

We are called to follow His method: "I can of mine own self do nothing." When we stop trying to fight sin with our own willpower and surrender fully to the Father as Jesus did, we step into His victory.
