Study Title: Creation and the Creator

---

Slide 1 Question: Who is the Creator, and how were the heavens and earth brought into existence?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a chaotic dark void beginning to separate as a glorious light breaks through from above, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1)

“By the word of the Lord were the heavens made... For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.” (Psalm 33:6-9)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible opens with the foundational truth that matter is not eternal; only God is eternal. He did not require pre-existing material to build the universe. He created by "fiat"—His spoken command implies omnipotent power.

[DYK] The phrase "He spake, and it was done" suggests immediacy. Unlike human manufacturing which requires time and effort, God’s will is instantly translated into reality through His Word.

Slide 4 Question: Through whom did the Father perform this work of creation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a silhouette of a divine figure standing amidst the stars and galaxies, looking over the cosmos, soft golden light.

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “For by Him [the Son] were all things created... visible and invisible... all things were created by Him, and for Him.” (Colossians 1:16)

“All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus Christ in a pre-incarnate glory, hands gesturing as if shaping the stars, ethereal and majestic.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The New Testament reveals that Jesus Christ (the Word) was the active agent in Creation. The Father and the Son were united in the work of bringing the universe into existence.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting showing a unity of light from the heavens touching the earth, symbolizing the connection between Father and Son in creation.

---

Slide 7 Term Definition: "Visible and invisible" encompasses the physical universe (stars, planets, nature) and the spiritual realm (angels, authorities, and powers). Christ is sovereign over both.

Slide 8 Question: How does the Bible describe the creation of humanity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a quiet garden scene, a figure made of clay lying on the ground, waiting for life, soft earth tones.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of God bending low over Adam, breathing the breath of life into him, intimate and sacred atmosphere.

---

Slide 10 The Process of Life:
1. **Formation**: God used physical matter ("dust") to shape the body.
2. **Animation**: God added the "breath of life" (spirit).
3. **Result**: Man *became* a living soul (a living person).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam beginning to rise from the earth, dust falling from his shoulders, eyes opening for the first time.

---

Slide 11 Illustration: The Living Soul
Consider a light bulb (the body) and electricity (the breath/spirit). Together, they produce light (the soul). If the electricity is removed, the light ceases to exist.

[ILL] The "soul" is the combination of body and breath, not a separate entity that exists outside the body.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a clay oil lamp with a bright flame, the oil and vessel working together to create the light, chiaroscuro style.

---

Slide 12 Question: In whose image was humanity made, and what was their original station?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve standing with dignity in Eden, looking outward with intelligence and grace.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “So God created man in His own image... male and female created He them.” (Genesis 1:27)

“Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet.” (Psalm 8:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man and woman surrounded by peaceful animals, looking regal and authoritative yet gentle.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Unlike the animals, humanity possesses the "image of God." This includes the ability to reason, the capacity for moral judgment, and the authority to govern the earth as God's stewards.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person deep in thought looking at the stars, symbolizing reason and connection to the Divine.

---

Slide 15 Question: What sustains the universe and keeps it from falling into chaos?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the night sky filled with stars, with a sense of order and structure, soft moonlight.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Upholding all things by the word of His power.” (Hebrews 1:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large, strong hand gently cradling a sphere representing the world, conveying protection and sustenance.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: Creation was not a one-time act of winding up a clock and walking away (Deism). The same "Word" that spoke the worlds into existence is required every moment to keep the atoms holding together and the planets in orbit.

[SN] Optional tangents: The link between Creator and Sabbath (Ex 20:8-11); The "breath" in Genesis vs. the Holy Spirit in the New Birth; Christ as Creator and Redeemer.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient clock mechanism or sundial, bathed in light, symbolizing time held in God's hand.

---

Slide 18 Question: Why are we called to worship God, and what distinguishes Him from false gods?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people kneeling in a field, looking up towards a break in the clouds.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.” (Psalm 95:6)

“The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish...” (Jeremiah 10:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting showing stone idols crumbling in the background while light shines on a simple altar to the true God.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Worship is due to God specifically because He is the Source of life. Any being or object that did not create the heavens and earth is a false god and unworthy of worship.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise over a mountain range, nature itself seeming to praise the Creator.

---

Slide 21 Question: Is God’s creative work finished, or is He working on something new in us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter working at a wheel, shaping a vessel with care and focus.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works...” (Ephesians 2:10)

“For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth...” (Isaiah 65:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vision of a beautiful, restored city and garden, glowing with a new kind of light.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: While the physical creation was finished in Genesis, God is currently engaged in a spiritual creation—restoring His image in the hearts of believers. This work prepares us for the ultimate promise: a physically restored New Earth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person in prayer, with a soft light illuminating their chest/heart area, symbolizing inner renewal.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application:
• **Stewardship**: Care for God's creation.
• **Unity**: Racism is a sin against the Creator of all.
• **Trust**: He who upholds the universe can uphold you.
