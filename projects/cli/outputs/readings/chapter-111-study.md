Study Title: Paul’s Desire: To Depart and Be with Christ

Question: When writing to the church in Philippi, what personal dilemma did the apostle Paul express?

Biblical Answer: “For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.” (Philippians 1:23)

Explanation: Paul describes himself as being under pressure, caught between two strong possibilities. He was torn between continuing his difficult work on earth or laying down his life to rest until the Lord comes.

[DYK] When Paul wrote this, he was likely a prisoner in Rome. He was facing a potential death sentence. His "strait" (difficulty) was not just theoretical; he was literally facing life or death judgment by the Empire.

Question: What does Paul mean by the word “depart”?

Biblical Answer: “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.” (2 Timothy 4:6)

Explanation: Paul uses “departure” as a gentle term for death. Just as a ship departs from the dock, death is a leaving of this present world.

Term Definition: **Departure** (Greek: *analusai*). This word was used for unloosing a ship from its moorings or striking down a tent. Paul viewed his body as a temporary tent or vessel (2 Corinthians 5:1).

Question: Paul said “to die is gain” (Phil 1:21). Does this mean he gains a personal reward immediately, or is there a deeper meaning?

Biblical Answer: “According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.” (Philippians 1:20)

Explanation: The context shows that the "gain" is the magnification of Christ. If Paul lives, he preaches Christ; if he dies a martyr’s death, his faithfulness witnesses for Christ. In either case, the Gospel gains.

[ILL] Imagine a soldier holding a flag. If he stands and fights, he honors his country. If he falls refusing to surrender, he also honors his country. Paul’s life was entirely about honoring his King, Jesus.

Question: If Paul departs (dies), when exactly does he get to “be with Christ”? Is it immediately, or is there an appointed time?

Biblical Answer: “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)

Explanation: Paul’s theology was consistent: the reunion with Jesus happens at the Resurrection (the Second Coming). He does not expect to be with the Lord as a disembodied spirit, but rather to be “caught up” along with the resurrected saints when the trumpet sounds.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Harmony of Scripture. Paul speaks of receiving a "crown of righteousness," but in 2 Timothy 4:8 he says the Lord will give it to him "at that day"—referring to the day of Christ’s appearing, not the day of his death. The Bible consistently points to the Resurrection as the hope of the believer.

Question: If Paul has to wait in the grave until the Resurrection, why did he say departing is “far better”?

Biblical Answer: [Derived from Scripture logic, supported by Ecclesiastes 9:5 and Psalm 146:4]

Explanation: In death, there is no consciousness of time. Scripture describes death as a “sleep.” To the one who dies, the very next instant of consciousness is the face of Jesus at the resurrection. Whether 20 minutes or 2,000 years pass on earth, to Paul, it would seem like the twinkling of an eye. It is "better" because the suffering stops, and the next moment is glory.

[ILL] Think of a deep, dreamless sleep or undergoing surgery with anesthesia. You close your eyes, and seemingly one second later, you wake up, even though hours have passed. Death is a rest from labor, and the "waking up" is the resurrection morning.

Question: If resting in death was better for Paul personally, what inclined him to choose life?

Biblical Answer: “Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.” (Philippians 1:24)

Explanation: This reveals Paul’s heart. Even though he was tired and longed for the rest that comes with death (and the subsequent resurrection), he was willing to endure more suffering if it helped the church. He put the needs of others above his own desire for rest.

Practical Application:
1.  **Confidence in Death**: For the believer, death is not the end, but a "departure"—a sleep that ends with the voice of Jesus.
2.  **Selflessness**: Like Paul, are we willing to labor for the good of others, even when we are tired?
3.  **Hope**: Our great hope is not death itself, but the Resurrection—the moment we will "ever be with the Lord."
