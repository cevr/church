Study Title: Christ and the Law: Magnified, Not Destroyed

Question: What was the Lord's prophetic purpose concerning His law?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord is well pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the law and make it honorable.” (Isaiah 42:21)

Explanation: To "magnify" something usually means to make a small object appear larger (like under a microscope). However, in this spiritual context, it means to reveal the true greatness, breadth, and glory of something that has been underestimated. Jesus came not to diminish the law, but to show how broad and spiritual its requirements truly are.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "magnify" here is *gadal*, which means "to make great, powerful, or important." The word for "honorable" implies majesty and glory. Christ came to restore the law to its rightful place of dignity.

Question: Why was it necessary for the Lord to work in this way?

Biblical Answer: “It is time for thee, Lord, to work; for they have made void thy law.” (Psalm 119:126) AND “Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.” (Mark 7:9)

Explanation: By the time Jesus arrived, religious leaders had encrusted the Ten Commandments with thousands of man-made rules and traditions. These human additions actually "made void" (emptied the power of) God's law, turning it into a burden rather than a delight.

[ILL] Imagine a beautiful painting covered in layers of dust and mud. The painting hasn't changed, but its beauty is obscured. Human tradition was the mud; Jesus came to wipe it away so the Law could be seen clearly again.

Question: Did Jesus come to abolish or remove the Law?

Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17)

Term Definition: “Fulfill” (Greek: *pleroo*) means "to fill up," "to make full," or "to bring to realization." It is the opposite of "empty" or "destroy." Jesus filled the law with its true meaning and perfectly lived it out.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Some argue that "fulfill" means "to finish and end." However, in the very next verse (Matt 5:18), Jesus says not one "jot or tittle" (the smallest strokes of Hebrew writing) will pass away as long as heaven and earth remain. If a builder "fulfills" a contract to build a house, he doesn't dynamite the house when he is done; the house stands as a monument to his work.

Question: How did Jesus specifically "magnify" the law in His teaching?

Biblical Answer: “Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill... But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment.” (Matthew 5:21-22)

Progressive Disclosure:
• The Letter of the Law: Do not commit the physical act of murder.
• The Spirit of the Law: Do not harbor unjust anger or hatred.
• The Letter of the Law: Do not commit the physical act of adultery.
• The Spirit of the Law: Do not harbor lust in the heart (Matthew 5:27-28).

Explanation: Jesus showed that the commandments are not just about outward actions, but about the condition of the heart. By extending the law's jurisdiction to our thoughts and motives, He "magnified" it—making it larger and more searching than the Pharisees ever imagined.

Question: If the law is so broad and we are sinful, how can we stand before it?

Biblical Answer: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us...” (Romans 8:3-4)

Deeper Insight: The law acts as a diagnostic tool—it reveals sin (Romans 3:20) and declares God’s standard—but it has no power to save or change the human heart ("it was weak through the flesh"). Only Christ could pay the penalty for our past disobedience and provide the Spirit to help us walk in obedience.

[ILL] A thermometer can tell you that you have a fever, but it cannot cure the fever. In the same way, the Law tells us we are sinners, but only the Great Physician (Jesus) can cure the sin.

Question: Does the death of Jesus mean the law is now abolished?

Biblical Answer: “Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression.” (Romans 4:15)

Explanation: If the law could have been changed or abolished, Jesus would not have needed to die. He died to pay the penalty demanded *by* the law. The fact that He paid the debt proves the debt (and the law that required it) was valid.

[SN] Historical/Theological Note: The cross is the greatest argument for the perpetuity of the Law. If a judge pardons a criminal by paying the fine himself, he upholds the law while showing mercy. If he simply tore up the rulebook, there would be no need for payment. Christ "magnified" the law by showing it was so sacred that even the Son of God could not bypass its penalty, but had to die to satisfy it.

Practical Application:
• **Respect:** We should view the Ten Commandments not as a checklist for salvation, but as a transcript of God’s character.
• **Internalize:** We ask God to write His law not just in our Bibles, but in our hearts (New Covenant promise).
• **Gratitude:** We praise Jesus for keeping the law perfectly and crediting His righteousness to us.
