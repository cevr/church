---

Slide 1 Question: Who is the only Being truly exalted above all existence?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For thou, Lord, art high above all the earth; thou art exalted far above all gods.” (Psalm 97:9)

“Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.” (Psalm 57:5)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Before we understand our place, we must understand God’s place. He is not merely "better" than created beings; He is in a completely different category. He is "High above" all earthly powers and claimed deities.

Slide 4 Question: Why does God possess this unique right to be exalted?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all...” (Nehemiah 9:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the cosmos, with stars and planets held in the hands of a divine figure, showing preservation.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: God’s exaltation is based on two facts:
1. He is the **Creator** (He made everything).
2. He is the **Sustainer** (He preserves everything).

A painting cannot exalt itself above the painter; likewise, the universe bows to its Maker.

Slide 7 Did You Know?

[DYK] In the ancient world, "hosts" referred to armies or vast multitudes. The "host of heaven" includes both the physical stars and the angelic beings. Nehemiah declares that even the angels worship Him.

Slide 8 Question: How does God’s kingdom measure greatness for humanity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple path leading down into a peaceful, fertile valley.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “He that shall humble himself shall be exalted.” (Matthew 23:12)

“Before honor is humility.” (Proverbs 15:33)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure washing the feet of another, bathed in soft, respectful light.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: The world teaches us to climb the ladder of success by pushing others down. The Bible teaches that the way up is down. To be great in God’s eyes, one must first be humble.

---

Slide 11 Term Definition: **Humility**

Humility is not thinking less of yourself (low self-esteem); it is thinking of yourself *less* (self-forgetfulness). It is recognizing our true dependence on God, much like a "little child" (Matthew 18:4).

Slide 12 Question: What is the root cause of sin and evil in the universe?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beautiful angel turning his face away from the light, a shadow falling across his features.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “For thou [Lucifer] hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven; I will exalt my throne above the stars of God... I will be like the Most High.” (Isaiah 14:13-14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a high mountain peak shrouded in storm clouds, symbolizing arrogant ambition.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Sin began with self-exaltation. Lucifer, a created angel, desired the position of the Creator. Notice the repetition of "I will." This focus on self-elevation severed his connection with the Source of life.

Slide 15 Illustration

[ILL] Imagine a branch trying to exalt itself by detaching from the vine to stand alone. It does not become a tree; it withers and dies. Lucifer’s attempt to rise without God resulted in his fall.

---

Slide 16 Question: How does prophecy describe the final manifestation of this spirit of self-exaltation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shadowed figure sitting in a grand temple, backlit by a false light.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “[The Man of Sin] opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.” (2 Thessalonians 2:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a throne within a temple, where a human figure sits in the place reserved for the Divine.

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: The spirit that began with Lucifer continues in human history. The Apostle Paul warns of a power that would arise within the church age, seeking to take the place of God.

[SN] Historic Adventist Theology: The pioneers identified this "Man of Sin" not as a political atheist, but as a religious power that claims the prerogatives of God—specifically the power to change God's eternal law (Daniel 7:25). While Lucifer wanted to be equal with God in power, this earthly power presumes to be above God by altering His commandments.

---

Slide 19 Question: Since we are all prone to pride, how do we fight against self-exaltation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in prayer, hands clasped, forehead resting on a stone.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” (2 Corinthians 10:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fortress wall being dismantled stone by stone, revealing light behind it.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: The battleground is the mind. We are instructed to use spiritual weapons to pull down the "strongholds" of pride. We must actively police our thoughts, submitting them to Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man in deep thought, a light breaking through the clouds above his head.

---

Slide 22 Question: What specific weapons has God given us for this battle?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a table laid out with pieces of ancient armor—helmet, shield, and sword.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: The girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the sandals of peace, the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the sword of the Spirit. (Ephesians 6:13-17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Roman soldier standing ready, equipped with full armor, soft golden lighting.

---

Slide 24 Illustration

[ILL] A soldier in ancient Rome would never enter battle without armor. Similarly, a Christian cannot overcome pride without the "armor" of Christ’s righteousness and the "sword" of His Word.

Slide 25 Question: If we maintain humility and wait on the Lord, what is the promise?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person waiting patiently by a window, watching the sunrise.

---

Slide 26 Biblical Answer: “Wait on the Lord, and keep His way, and He shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.” (Psalm 37:34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a peaceful, lush landscape with a humble family walking into the light.

---

Slide 27 Explanation: True exaltation is not something we grab for ourselves; it is a gift God gives in His timing. Just as God exalted Jesus after His suffering (Acts 5:31), He promises to lift up His people to inherit the earth made new.

Slide 28 Practical Application (Part 1)

1. **Check your motivation:** Are you seeking credit for your actions, or pointing glory to God?
2. **Accept correction:** God sometimes allows "thorns in the flesh" (2 Cor 12:7)—difficulties or weaknesses—to keep us humble. Do not despise them; they may be saving you from pride.

Slide 29 Practical Application (Part 2)

3. **Look to the Cross:** The ultimate cure for pride is looking at the Savior, who humbled Himself for us.
