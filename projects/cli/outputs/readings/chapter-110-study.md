Study Title: The Promise to the Thief: When is Paradise?

Question: What promise did Jesus make to the thief on the cross?

Biblical Answer: “And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with Me in Paradise.” (Luke 23:43)

Explanation: This verse records one of the most beautiful assurances of salvation in Scripture. However, it has often led to confusion regarding *when* this promise is fulfilled. To understand the timing, we must first identify the location of "Paradise."

Question: Where is Paradise located according to Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.” (Revelation 2:7)

Deeper Insight: Revelation 22:1-2 tells us the Tree of Life is located on either side of the river proceeding from the "throne of God." Therefore, Paradise is the dwelling place of God—the third heaven (2 Corinthians 12:2, 4).

Question: Did Jesus go to Paradise (God’s throne) on the day He died?

Biblical Answer: “Jesus saith unto her, Touch Me not; for I am not yet ascended to My Father...” (John 20:17)

Explanation: This conversation took place on Sunday morning, the third day after the crucifixion. If Jesus had not yet ascended to the Father (who dwells in Paradise) by Sunday, He could not have been in Paradise with the thief on Friday.

[DYK] The ancient Greek manuscripts of the New Testament were written in "scriptio continua"—continuous script without spaces or punctuation marks like commas. Punctuation was added by translators centuries later based on their theological understanding.

Question: What was the specific request the thief made?

Biblical Answer: “Lord, remember me when thou comest into Thy kingdom.” (Luke 23:42)

Explanation: The thief did not ask to be in Paradise *that day*. He looked forward to the time when Jesus would establish His kingdom.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the immense faith of the thief. While the religious leaders mocked Jesus and the disciples fled, this dying man looked at a crucified "criminal" and saw a King. He believed in a future resurrection and kingdom even when death seemed to have won.

Question: When does Jesus promise to take His people to be with Him?

Biblical Answer: “And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” (John 14:3)

Progressive Disclosure:
• Jesus prepares a place (now).
• Jesus comes again (future).
• Then He receives us (at the Second Coming).

Additional Reference: 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 confirms that the reunion happens when the Lord descends with a shout and the "dead in Christ" rise.

[ILL] Imagine a father leaving on a long journey telling his child, "I tell you today, I will bring you a gift when I return." The statement is made *today*, but the fulfillment happens *upon return*. The emphasis is on the certainty of the promise made on that specific day.

Question: How then should we understand the "Today" in Luke 23:43?

Biblical Answer: [Derived from harmony of Scripture] The comma should be placed *after* the word "today," not before it.

Explanation: Jesus was answering the thief's plea. On that day—a day of darkness, mockery, and apparent defeat—Jesus gave the assurance: "Verily I say unto thee today, [pause] shalt thou be with Me in Paradise." By moving the comma, the contradiction vanishes. Jesus made the promise on Friday, to be fulfilled at His Second Coming.

Term Definition: **Harmony of Scripture**: The principle that since all Scripture is inspired by one Spirit, one passage cannot contradict another. If Luke 23:43 implies Jesus went to heaven Friday, but John 20:17 says He didn't, we must look for an interpretation (like the punctuation correction) that allows both to be true.

Practical Application: This study teaches us two vital things:
1. It is never too late to turn to Jesus; His grace reaches even the final moments of life.
2. We can trust the consistency of God’s Word. The hope of the believer is not immediate flight to heaven at death, but the glorious resurrection at the return of Jesus.
