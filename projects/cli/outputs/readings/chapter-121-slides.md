---

Slide 1 Question: Does God consider it important that His children continue to move forward in their spiritual understanding?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.” (John 12:35)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Christian life is described as a "walk"—a journey involving movement and progress. Light is given not just to be admired, but to walk by. If we stop following the opening of God’s word, we do not remain stationary; we eventually find ourselves in darkness because the light moves on.

---

Slide 4 Illustration: Imagine walking through a dense forest at night with a lantern. If you stop moving, you make no progress home. If the lantern moves ahead and you refuse to follow, you are left behind in the dark. We must keep pace with God's revealing truth.

Slide 5 Question: What great benefit is promised to those who continue to walk in the light?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin.” (1 John 1:7)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: There is a direct connection between our willingness to follow truth and the cleansing power of Christ's blood. Walking in the light brings us into harmony (fellowship) with God and with other believers.

---

Slide 8 Definition: “Fellowship” (Greek: *koinonia*) implies deep partnership and shared participation. It is impossible to have true partnership with God while knowingly refusing the light He sends.

Slide 9 Question: Does God reveal all truth at once, or does it increase over time?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the first hint of dawn breaking over a mountain range, the sky shifting from dark blue to gold.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” (Proverbs 4:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the sun fully risen, casting brilliant, clear light over a lush landscape, dispelling all shadows.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Spiritual understanding is progressive. Just as the sun rises from the first faint dawn to the brilliance of noon ("the perfect day"), God illuminates our minds gradually as we are able to bear it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe unrolling a scroll, his face illuminated as if understanding a new concept, soft light focusing on his eyes.

---

Slide 12 Speaker Note: Early Adventist pioneers often used this verse to explain why they were discovering new truths (like the Sabbath or the Sanctuary doctrine) that their forefathers hadn't known. They believed that if they walked in the light their fathers had, God would faithfully reveal more light to them.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of 19th-century believers gathered around a table with open Bibles and oil lamps, looking upward in prayerful discovery.

---

Slide 13 Question: Why are people condemned? Is it simply because they were born in darkness?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man sitting in a dark corner, shielding his eyes from a bright light entering through an open door.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.” (John 3:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of shadowy figures retreating into an alleyway to avoid the light of a street lamp.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Condemnation is not based on what a person does not know (ignorance), but on their reaction when light is presented. The tragedy is not the darkness itself, but the *love* of darkness and the rejection of the remedy.

---

Slide 16 Did You Know: The human eye naturally adjusts to the level of light it is in. Similarly, the conscience can adjust to "darkness" (sin/error) until it feels normal. This is why Jesus warned, "Take heed... that the light which is in thee be not darkness" (Luke 11:35).

Slide 17 Question: What happens to the mind that persistently rejects truth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man wandering in a thick fog, looking confused and disoriented, reaching out into emptiness.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.” (2 Thessalonians 2:11, 12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king on a throne listening intently to a whispering advisor in the shadows, ignoring a prophet standing in the light.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: This is a solemn warning. If a person persistently refuses the truth because they prefer a sinful lifestyle or a convenient error, God eventually allows them to have what they desire. He does not force the mind. "Strong delusion" is the result of withdrawing the restraining Spirit of truth.

Slide 20 Question: Is being a "good person" enough, or must we accept new light when it comes?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Roman centurion kneeling in prayer, wearing armor but looking humble and seeking.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “He saw in a vision... an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius... Thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter... he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.” (Acts 10:3-6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a glowing angel appearing in a room to a surprised Cornelius, pointing him towards a window.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Cornelius was a devout, generous, and prayerful man who pleased God. Yet, this was not enough to save him without the knowledge of Christ. God did not leave him in partial ignorance; He miraculously arranged for Peter to bring "new light." Cornelius had to accept this new instruction to be saved.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter entering the home of Cornelius, greeting him with open arms, light streaming in from the doorway.

---

Slide 23 Speaker Note: This narrative underscores the importance of doctrine and specific truth. Sincerity alone is not a substitute for the Gospel. God honors sincerity by sending *more light*, which the sincere heart will then joyfully accept.

Slide 24 Question: Is it possible to be saved by God and then lost because we stop following Him?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast desert landscape, with the faint outline of Egypt in the far distance behind.

---

Slide 25 Biblical Answer: “I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.” (Jude 5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Israelite camp at night in the wilderness, some looking at the pillar of fire, others grumbling in the shadows.

---

Slide 26 Explanation: The Israelites were physically saved from Egypt, but many never entered the Promised Land because of unbelief and rebellion along the way. We must "hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end" (Hebrews 3:14).

Slide 27 Practical Application: How do we walk in the light today?
• By reading Scripture daily with an open heart.
• By being willing to change our habits when the Bible convicts us.
• By sharing the light we have with others.
• By not resting on past experiences, but seeking a fresh connection with Jesus today.
