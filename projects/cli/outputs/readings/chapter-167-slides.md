Slide 1 Question: How intimately is God acquainted with our private home life?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.” (Psalm 139:2-3)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God is not merely a distant observer; He is intimately involved in the daily rhythm of our lives. He sees us when we relax ("downsitting") and when we work ("uprising"). The home is not a place where we hide from God, but where we live in His presence.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "acquainted" implies a deep, personal knowledge, similar to the way a close friend or family member knows you, rather than just factual observation.

Slide 4 Question: What is the foundation for a wise and happy home?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments.” (Psalm 111:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family kneeling together in a circle, heads bowed in deep reverence and awe.

---

Slide 6 Term Definition: “Fear of the Lord” does not mean being afraid of God. In Scripture, it refers to a posture of profound reverence, awe, and respect. It is realizing who God is and honoring Him as the head of the house.

Slide 7 Question: How should parents interact with and instruct their children?

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a parent guiding a child’s hand as they learn a task, soft lighting highlighting the bond.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: The Bible commands a balance. Parents are warned against harshness that frustrates children ("provoke to wrath"). Instead, the method is "nurture" (providing an environment for growth) and "admonition" (gentle guidance and correction).

[ILL] Think of a gardener. If a gardener shouts at a plant or pulls it roughly, it damages the roots. Instead, they water the soil (nurture) and use a guide-stick to help it grow straight (admonition). Parenting requires the same patience.

Slide 10 Question: When and how often should spiritual truths be taught in the family?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.” (Deuteronomy 6:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father walking through a field with his son, pointing to the heavens, teaching him as they walk.

---

Slide 12 Progressive Disclosure:
*   **Formal teaching:** "Teach them diligently" (requires effort and planning).
*   **Informal modeling:** "Talk of them... when thou walkest" (lifestyle discipleship).
*   **Consistent rhythm:** Morning and evening ("risest up" and "liest down").

[SN] Spirit-led Insight: This text suggests that religion is not an event (like a weekly church service) but an atmosphere. In the Hebrew context, "walking by the way" implies that as we go about our daily chores, we interpret the world through the lens of God's Word for our children.

Slide 13 Question: What example of faithfulness does Abraham provide for fathers and mothers?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham standing near his tent, looking out over the landscape with a look of resolve.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord...” (Genesis 18:19); “And there he builded an altar unto the Lord, and called upon the name of the Lord.” (Genesis 12:8)

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Abraham’s leadership was characterized by two things: instructing his family to do what is right ("justice and judgment") and establishing a physical place for worship ("builded an altar") wherever the family moved.

[ILL] The "Family Altar" is a classic Christian metaphor for daily family worship. Just as the altar was the center of the patriarch's camp, the time of prayer and reading Scripture should be the center of the modern home.

Slide 16 Question: What is the promised result of consistent, early spiritual training?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a young man standing firm and confident, holding a scroll, ready to face the world.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” (Proverbs 22:6); “And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures...” (2 Timothy 3:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a grandmother (Lois) and mother (Eunice) teaching a young Timothy the scriptures.

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: The example of Timothy (2 Timothy 3:15) proves that early exposure to Scripture "molds" the character. Even though Timothy lived in a culture hostile to faith, the piety he saw at home prepared him for a life of immense usefulness.

[SN] Historical Note: Ellen White, writing in harmony with the pioneer perspective, described the father as the "priest of the household." This imagery suggests that the parents stand in the gap for their children, offering the "morning and evening sacrifice" of prayer and praise, creating a hedge of protection around the home.

Slide 19 Question: What attitude should permeate the Christian home to prevent conflict?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family sharing a simple meal, faces illuminated with joy and peace.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “In everything give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.” (1 Thessalonians 5:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands raised in prayer and thanksgiving against a backdrop of a sunrise.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: A home filled with complaining breeds discontent and rebellion. A home filled with gratitude ("giving thanks") invites the Spirit of God.

Slide 22 Practical Application: How can we build an altar in our homes this week?

1.  **Establish a Rhythm:** Set a specific, short time for morning or evening prayer.
2.  **Be Gentle:** Ensure your instruction is rooted in love.
3.  **Model It:** Let your children catch you praying.
4.  **Invite Jesus:** Make your home a place where "Jesus will love to tarry."
