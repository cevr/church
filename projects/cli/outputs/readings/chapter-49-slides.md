Slide 3 Explanation: The judgment is universal. It includes the entire human family, regardless of status or belief. The text indicates that God does not overlook anyone; every life comes under review to set the universe right.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? [DYK] The judgment is not limited to humanity. The Bible indicates that fallen angels are also "reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day" (Jude 6). God’s government deals with the entire cosmic rebellion.

Slide 5 Question: Where does the judgment begin?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God...” (1 Peter 4:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Peter writing an epistle, with a serious but hopeful expression, light falling on the parchment.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Logic dictates that before rewards are handed out, the winners must be identified. Therefore, the judgment begins with those who profess to serve God ("the house of God") to determine who is truly His before the final rewards are given.

Slide 8 Question: What evidence is used in this court?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavenly courtroom scene, focus on a large, unopened book resting on a pedestal.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “The judgment was set, and the books were opened.” (Daniel 7:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ancient of Days seated on a fiery throne, with myriads of angels attending and scrolls being unrolled.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: God’s judgment is not arbitrary; it is based on a recorded history. The "books" represent an exact transcript of decisions, words, and deeds.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavenly scribe diligently recording events in a large scroll, surrounded by soft, ethereal light.

---

Slide 11 Definitions:
**"Books of Remembrance" (Malachi 3:16):** Contain the record of good deeds and those who thought upon God's name.
**"Book of Life" (Revelation 3:5):** Contains the names of those professed to be God's children.

[ILL] Imagine a court case where the judge has a perfect recording and transcript of every event. There can be no mistake in the verdict because the evidence is complete.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two distinct scrolls lying on a wooden table, one glowing with a golden aura, representing the Book of Life.

Slide 12 Question: Does this judgment happen before or after the Second Coming of Jesus?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the clouds parting, hinting at the Second Coming, with a question mark subtly integrated into the composition.

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead...” (Luke 20:35)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching in the temple courts, gesturing upward towards heaven.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Notice the phrase "accounted worthy." To be found worthy to rise in the "resurrection of life" (John 5:29) when Jesus returns, a decision must have been made *before* He arrives. This phase is often called the "Investigative Judgment."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pair of scales in the sanctuary, balanced perfectly, symbolizing a decision made prior to an event.

---

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: When Christ returns, His reward is *with* Him (Revelation 22:12). He does not come to investigate, but to execute the decision already made in the courts of heaven.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The prophecy of Daniel 7 describes the judgment scene happening *before* the Son of Man receives His kingdom. This aligns with the High Priest's work of cleansing the sanctuary before blessing the people.

---

Slide 16 Question: Who defends the believer during this judgment?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lone figure standing before a judge, with a strong defender stepping in between them.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “He that overcometh... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.” (Revelation 3:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus, robed in white, standing with arms open before the Father’s throne, advocating for His people.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: We do not stand alone. Jesus acts as our Advocate. If we have confessed our sins and remained loyal to Him, He covers our imperfect lives with His perfect righteousness.

[ILL] If you were on trial for a capital crime, your only hope would be a defense attorney who not only knows the law perfectly but has also paid the penalty for you. Jesus is that Attorney.

Slide 19 Question: What role do the saved play in the judgment of the wicked?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of saints wearing crowns, looking at scrolls with serious, contemplative expressions.

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?... Know ye not that we shall judge angels?” (1 Corinthians 6:2-3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul addressing the Corinthian church, holding a scroll.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: After the Second Coming, during the thousand years (Revelation 20:4), the saved participate in a review of the cases of the lost. God allows the redeemed to see the records, ensuring everyone understands God’s decisions were just.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the redeemed in heaven, seated on thrones, examining open books in a peaceful, light-filled hall.

Slide 23 Practical Application: How should we live in light of the judgment?
• **With seriousness:** “God shall bring every work into judgment.”
• **With confidence:** We have an Advocate who has never lost a case.
• **With urgency:** Share the "everlasting gospel" (Revelation 14:7).
