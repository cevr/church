---

Slide 1 Question: What warning is given regarding those who worship the beast and receive his mark?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “If any man worship the beast and his image... the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden chalice being poured out, symbolizing divine judgment, with a dramatic yet reverent atmosphere.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The "wrath of God" is defined as the seven last plagues (Revelation 15:1). The phrase "without mixture" is fearful; previously, all judgments were mixed with mercy. Here, mercy is withdrawn because the time of salvation has passed.

Slide 4 Insight: The End of Intercession

[DYK] In the ancient sanctuary service, the High Priest eventually finished his work and left the sanctuary. Revelation 15:8 describes the heavenly temple filling with smoke, signifying that Christ’s intercessory work has ceased. No man can enter until the plagues are fulfilled.

Slide 5 Question: When does the time of probation close?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still... And, behold, I come quickly.” (Revelation 22:11, 12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ standing in royal robes, looking forward with a gaze of finality and determination.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: This decree goes forth *before* Christ returns. It marks the specific moment when human character is fixed forever. Probation closes before the plagues begin.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Days of Noah

[ILL] Consider Noah’s day. The door of the ark was shut while the sky was still clear. Those outside could not enter, even though the rain had not yet started. Similarly, there will be a period after intercession ceases, but before Christ appears, where no one’s spiritual condition can be changed.

Slide 9 Question: What is the nature of the first three plagues?

Slide 10 Plague 1: Upon the Earth

**Biblical Answer:** “A noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast.” (Revelation 16:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people in a marketplace looking in distress at their hands and arms, soft lighting emphasizing the emotional gravity rather than graphic detail.

---

Slide 11 Plague 2: Upon the Sea

**Biblical Answer:** “It became as the blood of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast ocean turned a deep crimson red, with ships sitting motionless on the heavy waters.

Slide 12 Plague 3: Upon Rivers and Fountains

**Biblical Answer:** “And they became blood.” (Revelation 16:4)

---

Slide 13 Deeper Insight: Why Blood?

The angel of the waters declares, “For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy” (Revelation 16:6). This is strict retributive justice against those who persecuted God’s people.

Slide 14 Question: How do the subsequent plagues affect the heavens and the seat of the beast?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the sun burning with unusual intensity in the sky, casting harsh shadows.

Slide 15 Plague 4: The Sun

**Biblical Answer:** “Power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.” (Revelation 16:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a parched landscape under an intensely bright and large sun, heat shimmering in the air.

---

Slide 16 Plague 5: The Seat of the Beast

**Biblical Answer:** “His kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain.” (Revelation 16:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a grand throne room plunged into thick, supernatural shadows, with only faint outlines of architecture visible.

---

Slide 17 Definition: Seat of the Beast

"Seat of the beast" refers to the center of authority and power of the antichrist. Even in the midst of global scorching heat, this specific power is plunged into supernatural darkness.

Slide 18 Note: A Distinction in Judgment

[SN] During the plagues of Egypt, there was light in the dwellings of Israel while darkness covered Egypt (Exodus 10:23). A similar distinction is made in the end times. While the wicked suffer, God is a refuge for His people.

Slide 19 Question: What promise is given to the righteous during this time of trouble?

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee... neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.” (Psalm 91:7, 10)

Slide 21 Explanation: Divine Protection

While the world shakes, God’s people are protected. Joel 3:16 confirms that while the heavens and earth shake, “the Lord will be the hope of His people.”

Slide 22 Question: What events occur under the final two plagues?

Slide 23 Plague 6: The Euphrates

**Biblical Answer:** “The water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared.” (Revelation 16:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dried riverbed with the silhouette of kings and armies approaching from the distant sunrise.

---

Slide 24 Plague 7: The Air

**Biblical Answer:** A great voice says, “It is done.” (Revelation 16:17). This is followed by a mighty earthquake and great hail, “every stone about the weight of a talent.”

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic sky with lightning, large hailstones falling, and the earth trembling.

---

Slide 25 Note: The Weight of Judgment

[DYK] A "talent" in biblical weights could range from 50 to 100 pounds (22 to 45 kg). Hailstones of this magnitude represent the total destruction of earthly structures.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on a single, massive hailstone on the ground, showing its scale relative to a common object.

---

Slide 26 Question: What is the result for those who rejected the warning message?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man wandering in a barren wilderness, looking desperate and thirsty.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord... they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.” (Amos 8:11-12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sealed scroll lying on a rock, unreadable and inaccessible.

---

Slide 28 Summary: Progressive Disclosure

1. God sends the Third Angel’s Message as a final warning.
2. Those who reject it eventually face the close of probation.
3. When the plagues fall, they seek God’s word for relief.
4. It is too late; the "Master of the house... hath shut to the door" (Luke 13:25).

Slide 29 Practical Application

The Third Angel’s Message is the last special call to this generation. We are currently in the time of "hearing." How are we treating the Word of God today, while the door of mercy remains open?
