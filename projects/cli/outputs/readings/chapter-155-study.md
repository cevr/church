Study Title: Returning to the Source: Understanding and Healing Backsliding

Question: What is the nature of backsliding, and what are its results?

Biblical Answer: “Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God...” (Jeremiah 2:19)

Explanation: Backsliding is not merely breaking a rule; it is an abandonment of the source of life. The text describes it as "evil and bitter." Interestingly, the punishment for backsliding is inherent in the act itself—separation from God naturally results in spiritual correction and sorrow.

[DYK] The term "backsliding" comes from an agricultural metaphor of a heifer or ox sliding backward or refusing to pull the yoke. It implies a stubborn resistance to moving forward with God.

Question: Is there a natural tendency in the human heart to drift from God?

Biblical Answer: “And My people are bent to backsliding from Me.” (Hosea 11:7)

Explanation: The prophet Hosea notes that humanity is "bent" or inclined toward wandering. Jeremiah 8:6 adds that this happens when no man repents or asks, "What have I done?" Without self-reflection, people rush into their own courses "as the horse rusheth into the battle."

[ILL] Imagine a warhorse charging blindly into the chaos of battle, unaware of the danger. Similarly, when we fail to pause and examine our spiritual condition, we often rush headlong into spiritual danger.

Question: How does God view our departure from Him?

Biblical Answer: “Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with Me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.” (Jeremiah 3:20)

Explanation: God uses the most intimate human relationship—marriage—to describe His bond with us. Backsliding is not just a legal violation; it is a personal heartbreak to God, viewed as treachery against a covenant of love.

Question: What is the remedy for backsliding?

Biblical Answer: “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy upon him... for He will abundantly pardon.” (Isaiah 55:7)

Step-by-Step Restoration:
1.  **Acknowledge:** Admit the transgression (Jeremiah 3:13).
2.  **Forsake:** Turn away from the wrong path and the wrong *thoughts*.
3.  **Return:** Come back to the Lord, who waits with mercy.

[SN] Note that Isaiah calls for forsaking "thoughts," not just actions. Verse 8 explains that God’s thoughts are not our thoughts. True revival begins in the mind—aligning our thinking with God’s perspective rather than our own carnal reasoning.

Question: How can a believer be secured against sliding back?

Biblical Answer: “The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.” (Psalm 37:31)

Explanation: Stability comes from internalization. When the Law of God moves from stone tablets or external rules into the heart (affections and mind), obedience becomes natural, and one’s spiritual footing becomes sure.

Question: What specific practical test does God sometimes use to call His people back?

Biblical Answer: “Return unto Me, and I will return unto you... But ye said, Wherein shall we return? ... In tithes and offerings.” (Malachi 3:7-8)

Explanation: When the heart slides from God, stewardship often declines. God invites His people to "prove" Him by restoring faithfulness in tithes and offerings, promising that He will pour out a blessing too large to receive (Malachi 3:10).

Question: Is there hope for the backslider?

Biblical Answer: “I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for Mine anger is turned away from him.” (Hosea 14:4)

Explanation: God views backsliding as a disease that needs healing rather than a crime requiring only execution. He offers to "heal" the wandering heart and love the repentant sinner freely.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The concept of "healing" backsliding suggests that sin damages the soul like a physical wound. Just as Jesus healed the body during His ministry, His High Priestly ministry heals the character of those who return to Him.

Question: Why is vigilance especially necessary in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.” (Matthew 24:12)

Explanation: As the world becomes more lawless (iniquity abounding), the spiritual atmosphere chills. The danger for the Christian is that their love for God and truth will grow cold.

Practical Application: To prevent this cooling of love, Jesus commands us to "Watch and pray" (Mark 14:38) and to "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith" (2 Corinthians 13:5). Daily communion keeps the fire of love burning.
