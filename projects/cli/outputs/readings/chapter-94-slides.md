Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it...” (Genesis 2:2, 3)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Sabbath was not an afterthought; it was the climax of Creation. God performed three distinct acts on this day:
1.  He **rested**.
2.  He **blessed** it.
3.  He **sanctified** it (set it apart for holy use).

---

Slide 4 Insight: Because the Sabbath was established in Eden, before the existence of any distinct nation or Jewish people, it is a gift given to all humanity.

[DYK] The "week" is the only major division of time with no astronomical basis. The year follows the sun, the month the moon, but the week is a standing monument to the creative cycle of God in Genesis.

Slide 5 Question: Why does the Commandment say God put His blessing on the Sabbath?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11)

Slide 7 Term Definition: **Hallowed** means to keep holy or to treat with reverence.

*   We do not *make* the Sabbath holy; God made it holy at Creation.
*   We *keep* it holy by abstaining from labor and recognizing God as Creator.

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine a birthday. You celebrate it not because of a law passed today, but because of an event that happened years ago.

[ILL] The Commandment begins with the word "Remember" because it points backward to the "birthday" of the world.

Slide 9 Question: How did Jesus relate to the Sabbath during His life on earth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking through the streets of Nazareth, gentle and determined.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” (Luke 4:16)

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Jesus is our example. He kept the Sabbath as a lifelong custom, treating it not as a burden, but as a day for worship and the Word.

[SN] Some claim the Sabbath was only for the Jews. However, it was proclaimed at Sinai 2,500 years after Creation. It existed long before the Jewish people as part of God's moral law for mankind.

Slide 12 Question: Did Jesus expect His followers to stop keeping the Sabbath after His resurrection?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting on the Mount of Olives, speaking seriously to His disciples about the future.

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.” (Matthew 24:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family hurrying along a road in a wintry landscape, looking back with concern.

---

Slide 14 Progressive Disclosure:
*   Jesus is speaking here of the destruction of Jerusalem.
*   This event occurred in **A.D. 70**, nearly 40 years after the Cross.
*   Jesus expected His people to still be regarding the Sabbath as sacred long after His death.

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: If the Sabbath were to be abolished at the Cross, Jesus would not have instructed His disciples to pray about its observance forty years into the future. This indicates the continuity of the moral law in the Christian era.

Slide 16 Question: What acts does the Bible warn against regarding the Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a busy ancient marketplace gate, with merchants carrying heavy sacks.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “But if ye will not hearken unto Me to hallow the Sabbath day, and not to bear a burden... then I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof...” (Jeremiah 17:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a city gate at sunset, with a foreboding shadow cast across the entrance.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The prophet Jeremiah warned that carrying burdens—engaging in commerce and secular labor—on the Sabbath would lead to national ruin. Scripture connects the destruction of Jerusalem directly to the profaning of the Sabbath.

Slide 19 Question: Since the Bible supports the seventh day, on what authority was the change to Sunday made?

---

Slide 20 Historical Answer: “Had she [the Church] not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is no scriptural authority.” (*Doctrinal Catechism*)

Slide 21 History of the Change (Part 1): The shift was not commanded by Christ or the Apostles. It involved:

1.  **Anti-Jewish Sentiment:** Early leaders sought to separate Christianity from "the rabble of the Jews."

---

Slide 22 History of the Change (Part 2):

2.  **Pagan Influence:** The church adopted the "venerable day of the sun" (Sun worship) to make Christianity easier for pagans to accept.
3.  **Human Authority:** Church councils (e.g., Laodicea, A.D. 364) eventually placed anathemas on those who rested on the Sabbath.

---

Slide 23 Illustration: Historian J.H. Robinson describes this process like two streams merging. Christianity and paganism met like armies in conflict, but eventually flowed together, blending the "day of the sun" with the worship of the Son of God.

[SN] Daniel 7:25 predicted a power that would "think to change times and laws." Sunday is a plant sown by an "enemy" to lead people away from God's sign of authority.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: The Sabbath is more than a day off; it is a test of loyalty.
*   Will we follow the custom of Christ or the traditions of history?
*   It offers rest from the stress of the world.
*   It identifies the Creator.

Slide 25 Conclusion: God invites us to step out of the stream of tradition and onto the solid rock of Scripture. By keeping the Sabbath, we connect with the apostolic church and honor the Creator of the universe.
