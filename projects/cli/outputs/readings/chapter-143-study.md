Study Title: Shadows to Substance: The Lord's Supper and the New Covenant

Question: How were God's people expected to live before Christ came, as seen in the lives of Zacharias and Elizabeth?

Biblical Answer: “And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.” (Luke 1:6)

Explanation: This verse highlights two distinct aspects of a righteous life: the "commandments" (God's moral law) and the "ordinances" (the ceremonial religious services). Zacharias and Elizabeth were faithful in both.

Term Definition: "Ordinances" in this context refers to the ceremonial laws, including the temple services, sacrifices, and feast days.

Question: What was the purpose of the ceremonial ordinances involving sacrifices and offerings?

Biblical Answer: “For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.” (Hebrews 10:1)

Explanation: The ceremonial system was a "shadow." A shadow is not the reality; it merely outlines the shape of the reality. These sacrifices pointed forward to the coming Messiah but could not themselves solve the problem of sin.

[ILL] Imagine seeing the shadow of a person coming around a corner. The shadow tells you someone is coming, but you cannot shake hands with the shadow. You must wait for the person (the substance) to arrive. The sacrifices were the shadow; Jesus is the Person.

[DYK] In the Levitical system, if a common person sinned, they had to bring a female goat without blemish (Leviticus 4:27-28). This was a costly and bloody object lesson intended to show the terrible price of sin.

Question: Since animal sacrifices cannot take away sin, what was the solution?

Biblical Answer: “For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins. ... Sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared Me.” (Hebrews 10:4-5)

Explanation: The repetitive nature of animal sacrifices proved their inability to cleanse the conscience. They were temporary markers until God "prepared a body" for Jesus. Christ became the true sacrifice that the animals only typified.

Question: Under the New Covenant, what happens to the Ten Commandments?

Biblical Answer: “But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel: After those days, saith the Lord, I will put My law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.” (Jeremiah 31:33; Hebrews 8:8-10)

Explanation: The New Covenant does not abolish the Law; it relocates it. Instead of being written only on tables of stone (Exodus 24:12), the Holy Spirit writes God's principles of love and duty directly into our minds and affections ("inward parts").

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the beautiful balance here. Repentance is toward God (whose Law was broken), and faith is toward our Lord Jesus Christ (who paid the penalty) (Acts 20:20-21). This preserves the integrity of the Law while exalting the grace of the Gospel.

Question: How do we publicly commemorate the death and resurrection of Jesus?

Biblical Answer:
**For the Resurrection:** “Buried with Him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with Him through the faith of the operation of God...” (Colossians 2:12)
**For His Death:** “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till He come.” (1 Corinthians 11:26)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Baptism**: A one-time event signifying our death to the old life and rising to a new life, just as Christ died and rose.
2.  **The Lord's Supper**: A repeated ordinance to keep the memory of His sacrifice fresh in our minds.

[DYK] The word "baptize" comes from the Greek *baptizo*, meaning to immerse or dip under. This is why the Bible uses the imagery of being "buried" (going under) and "risen" (coming up).

Question: What do the symbols of the Lord's Supper represent?

Biblical Answer:
**The Bread:** “Take, eat; this is My body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of Me.” (1 Corinthians 11:24)
**The Cup:** “This cup is the new testament in My blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me.” (1 Corinthians 11:25)

Explanation: The bread represents Christ's body, broken to make us whole. The cup represents the "New Testament" (or New Covenant) ratified by His blood. We partake of these not to sacrifice Him again, but to bring to memory what He accomplished on the cross.

Term Definition: "Remembrance" implies more than just mental recall; it is an active memorial, a time to realign our lives with the reality of His sacrifice.

Question: What attitude should we have when participating in this service?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.” (1 Corinthians 11:27)

Explanation: To partake "unworthily" means to treat the service as a common meal or to participate without a repentant heart. It requires self-examination. We must ensure we are not holding onto known sin or rebellion while claiming the emblems of His grace.

[SN] Tangent on Worship: After instituting this solemn service, Jesus and His disciples "sung a hymn" before going to the Mount of Olives (Matthew 26:30). This suggests that despite the sorrow of the cross, the Communion service is ultimately an act of worship and praise.

Practical Application:
*   **Internal Law**: Ask God today to write His law of love in your heart, rather than just trying to follow rules externally.
*   **Remembrance**: When you participate in Communion, visualize it as a "looking back" to the Cross and a "looking forward" to His coming.
*   **Preparation**: Before partaking, take time to repent and make things right with God and others.
