Study Title: The Agency of the Spirit: Power, Presence, and Prophecy

Question: Where do we first see the Holy Spirit at work in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” (Genesis 1:2)

Explanation: Before God spoke the world into order, the Spirit was present. The Spirit is the active agent of creation, bringing life and structure out of chaos.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "moved" (*rachaph*) describes a hovering or brooding motion, similar to a mother bird fluttering over her nest. It implies affectionate protection and readiness to bring forth life.

Question: Did Jesus rely on the Holy Spirit during His earthly ministry?

Biblical Answer: “But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.” (Matthew 12:28)
“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins... being put to death in the flesh, but quickened [made alive] by the Spirit.” (1 Peter 3:18)

Explanation: Although Jesus was divine, He lived as a man dependent on God. He performed miracles and was eventually raised from the dead through the power of the Holy Spirit. This sets the pattern for how believers are to live—dependent on that same Spirit.

[ILL] Imagine a master surgeon (Jesus) using a precise instrument (the Spirit) to heal. Even the Master works through the agency of His Spirit to accomplish the miraculous.

Question: How does the Spirit affect the heart of a person who does not yet know God?

Biblical Answer: “And when He [the Spirit] is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” (John 16:8)

Term Definition: “Reprove” here means to convict, to expose, or to bring a realization of truth to the conscience. It is the Spirit’s job to show us our need for a Savior.

Question: Once a person believes, what work does the Spirit perform inside them?

Biblical Answer: “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” (2 Thessalonians 2:13)
“And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever.” (John 14:16)

Explanation: The Spirit does not leave us after conversion. He acts as a "Comforter" (a helper or advocate) and begins the work of "sanctification"—the daily process of making us holy and Christ-like.

[SN] The word "Comforter" (Parakletos) refers to one called to walk alongside another. In the pioneer Adventist understanding, this emphasizes that the Spirit is not merely an abstract force, but a personal presence representing Jesus to the believer.

Question: How did we get the Bible, and what is its connection to the Spirit?

Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21)
“And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (Ephesians 6:17)

Explanation: The Bible is not just a book of human ideas. The Spirit "moved" the prophets to write. Consequently, the Bible is the "Sword" the Spirit uses to cut through lies and defend the truth.

[DYK] The phrase "moved by the Holy Ghost" uses a Greek term often used for a ship being carried along by the wind. The writers raised their sails (their willingness), and the Spirit provided the direction and power.

Question: Was the gift of prophecy and visions limited only to Old Testament times?

Biblical Answer: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.” (Acts 2:17, referencing Joel 2:28)

Progressive Disclosure: • The promise was for "afterward" (Joel) • Peter identified this as the "last days" (Acts) • The gifts extend to sons, daughters, old, and young.

Deeper Insight: Peter identifies the outpouring of the Spirit as a defining characteristic of the "last days." God intends for His church to be guided by the Spirit of Prophecy until the very end of time.

[SN] Tangent on Spiritual Gifts: Ephesians 4:8-11 lists apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers as gifts given *after* Christ’s ascension. These are not human talents alone but spiritual endowments for the "perfecting of the saints."

Question: Why did Jesus tell His disciples to wait before starting their mission?

Biblical Answer: “...but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.” (Luke 24:49)

Explanation: The disciples had the message (the Gospel), but they needed the power (the Spirit). Mission without the Spirit is ineffective.

[ILL] You can have a car with a perfect destination programmed into the GPS, but without fuel in the tank, it isn't going anywhere. The Spirit is the power that drives the mission of the church.

Practical Application: The Holy Spirit desires to do three things in your life today:
1. **Convict:** Show you where you need Jesus.
2. **Comfort:** Stay by your side as a constant companion.
3. **Empower:** Give you the strength to obey the truth and share it with others.
Are you willing to "tarry" (wait) in prayer today to receive this power?
