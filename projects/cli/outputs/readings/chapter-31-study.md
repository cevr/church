Study Title: The Obedience of Faith

Question: When God called Abraham, what command was given, and what was the motivation behind Abraham's response?

Biblical Answer: “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred... unto a land that I will shew thee.” (Genesis 12:1). “By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out... and he went out, not knowing whither he went.” (Hebrews 11:8, R.V.)

Explanation: Abraham (then Abram) was asked to leave his security, family, and culture for an unknown destination. The text clarifies that his obedience was not a blind leap into the dark, but a leap into the arms of God. The motive was faith; the action was obedience.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, a person's identity and safety were entirely tied to their "father's house" and kinship group. To leave this was to make oneself vulnerable and entirely dependent on divine protection.

Question: How is the relationship between faith and actions (works) described in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?” (James 2:22). “For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing... but faith which worketh by love.” (Galatians 5:6)

Explanation: True faith is never static; it is an active principle. James explains that works are the evidence—or the "perfection"—of faith. Paul adds in Galatians that the driving force behind this active faith is love.

[ILL] Think of a fruit tree. Faith is the root and the sap, invisible beneath the surface. Obedience is the fruit. You cannot have the fruit without the root, but a root that produces no fruit is dead.

Term Definition: “Justified by works” (James 2:21) in this context means "demonstrated to be righteous" or "vindicated." It does not mean earning heaven, but rather proving the genuineness of one's faith.

Question: Does God value religious rituals more than simple obedience?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.” (1 Samuel 15:22)

Explanation: The prophet Samuel spoke these words to King Saul. God is not impressed by outward displays of religion (sacrifice) if the heart remains rebellious. A humble heart that listens and acts on God's word is of higher value than the most expensive offering.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The "fat of rams" refers to the choicest part of the sacrifice burned on the altar. It represents giving God the very best. However, giving God "things" while withholding our will is a form of spiritual counterfeiting. The only thing we can give God that He does not already possess is our voluntary will.

Question: What example did Jesus Christ set regarding obedience?

Biblical Answer: “Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered; And being made perfect, He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him.” (Hebrews 5:8-9)

Explanation: Jesus is our pattern. He did not use His divinity to escape the requirements of the law. He lived a life of total dependence on the Father.

Deeper Insight: The phrase "learned obedience" implies experiencing the reality and cost of obedience. Christ passed the test where Adam (and humanity) failed. His perfect obedience is credited to us for righteousness, and His Spirit empowers us to walk in His steps.

Question: How deep does this obedience go? Is it just about outward actions?

Biblical Answer: “Casting down imaginations... and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” (2 Corinthians 10:5)

Explanation: The "obedience of faith" reaches into the mind. It involves surrendering our very thoughts, motives, and imaginations to the lordship of Jesus.

Question: What is the result for those who follow this path of obedient faith?

Biblical Answer: “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love...” (1 Peter 1:22). “If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.” (Isaiah 1:19)

Practical Application: True obedience purifies the soul and results in love for others. It is not a burden, but a pathway to blessing.
• Where is God asking for "obedience of faith" in your life today?
• Are there "sacrifices" (religious activities) you are offering instead of simply obeying a clear command of Scripture?
• Remember, the power to obey comes from the "grace of Christ" (Romans 1:5).
