---

Slide 1 Question: Can any human being be justified—or declared righteous—before God based on their own merits?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.” (Psalm 143:2)

Slide 3 Explanation: When measured against God’s perfect standard, no human being can claim innocence. We are all disqualified by our own record.

Slide 4 Term Definition: **To Justify**
“To pronounce free from guilt or blame; to absolve; to clear.”

It is a legal term meaning the person is declared to be in right standing with the law.

Slide 5 Did You Know?
In a human court, a judge justifies the *innocent* by looking at the evidence.

In God’s court, He justifies the *guilty* by looking at Jesus. This is the miracle of the Gospel.

Slide 6 Question: If we have all sinned and fall short of God’s glory, how then are we justified?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 3:24)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of iron shackles lying broken on a dusty floor, symbolizing freedom and redemption.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: We cannot earn this standing. It is given "freely" (without cost to us) by God's grace (unmerited favor). It is made possible only because Jesus Christ paid the price of redemption.

Slide 9 Illustration: The Debtor and the Friend
Imagine a debtor standing before a judge with a debt he can never pay. A wealthy friend steps in, pays the full amount, and the judge hands the debtor a receipt stamped "Paid in Full."

The debtor walks out free, not because he had money, but because he had a friend.

Slide 10 Question: What great exchange took place so that we could be called righteous?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “For He hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Corinthians 5:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ on the cross, dark skies behind him, portraying the weight of the burden he carried.

---

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: This is the heart of the atonement. Jesus, who was perfectly innocent, was treated as we deserve (made "to be sin"), so that we, who are guilty, might be treated as He deserves (made "righteousness").

Slide 13 Question: What name is given to Jesus that describes this saving relationship?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And this is His name whereby He shall be called, The Lord Our Righteousness.” (Jeremiah 23:6)

Slide 15 Speaker Note: *Jehovah-Tsidkenu*
This title, *The Lord Our Righteousness*, was a focal point for early Adventist pioneers when rediscovering the beauty of righteousness by faith in the 1888 era. It shifts the focus from our performance to His person.

---

Slide 16 Question: Does this free gift of righteousness mean we can ignore God's Law or continue in sin?

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” (Romans 3:31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person holding a scroll of the law close to their heart with an expression of love and gratitude.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: Faith does not destroy the law; it establishes it. The law detects sin (Romans 3:20), but only Grace can forgive it. A person who has been forgiven such a great debt will naturally desire to live in harmony with the One who saved them.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a path illuminated by a lamp, symbolizing the law guiding the way for a believer.

Slide 19 Illustration: The Mirror and the Water
A mirror (the Law) shows you the dirt on your face, but it cannot wash it off. You need water (Grace) to cleanse you.

Once you are clean, you don't break the mirror; you are thankful for it because it showed you your need.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient bronze mirror reflecting a face, alongside a basin of clear water.

Slide 20 Question: What is the experience of the person who is justified by faith?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person sitting by a calm river at sunset, looking peaceful and content.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a white dove descending through breaking clouds, symbolizing divine peace.

---

Slide 22 The Fruits of Justification:
• Removal of guilt
• Restoration of fellowship
• Peace of mind
• Assurance of salvation

Slide 23 Question: In the last days, how are God's people identified regarding their faith and obedience?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophetic horizon with clouds gathering, rays of light breaking through.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people in white robes standing firm and looking upward with hope.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: The end-time saints are not legalists trying to earn heaven, nor are they lawless. They possess the "faith of Jesus"—a faith so deep it relies entirely on Christ—which results in a life that naturally keeps the commandments of God.

Slide 26 Practical Application:
To be justified, we must stop trying to prove we are "good enough" and simply accept Jesus as our substitute.

1. **Confess**: Acknowledge that we fall short.
2. **Believe**: Trust that His death covers our sin.
3. **Receive**: Accept His righteousness as a gift.
4. **Walk**: Live in the peace that comes from being right with God.
