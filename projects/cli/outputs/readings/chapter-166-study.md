Study Title: The Divine Foundation of a Happy Home

Question: Where were the foundations of the home first laid?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.” (Gen. 2:8)

Explanation: The home is not a human invention; it is a divine institution. God prepared the home *before* He created the family to inhabit it. It was the first school and the first church.

[DYK] The word "Eden" signifies "pleasure" or "delight." God’s original design for the home was for it to be a place of supreme happiness and safety.

Question: In God’s perfect plan, what was needed to complete man’s happiness?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet [or adapted] for him.” (Gen. 2:18)

Term Definition: “Help meet” implies a helper that is suitable, adapted, or corresponding to him. It suggests a counterpart that completes what is lacking, creating a unified whole.

[ILL] Consider a lock and a key. They are different in shape and function, yet they are "meet" (suitable) for one another. One is essential to the purpose of the other. So it is with the divine plan for husband and wife.

Question: How does Scripture view the addition of children to the family unit?

Biblical Answer: “Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord.” (Ps. 127:3) “Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children are their fathers.” (Prov. 17:6)

Progressive Disclosure:
• Children are a "heritage" (a gift entrusted by God, not a burden).
• Grandchildren are a "crown" (a sign of honor and established legacy).
• Fathers are the "glory" of children (referencing the dignity and example parents are to provide).

[SN] The concept of "Heritage" implies stewardship. In the SDA pioneer perspective, parents are viewed as stewards of their children's souls, entrusted to train them for the future, immortal life. The home is the nursery of the church and of society.

Question: Does the happiness of a home depend on wealth or the abundance of possessions?

Biblical Answer: “A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15) “Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.” (Prov. 15:17)

Explanation: Jesus teaches that the quality of life is spiritual, not material. Solomon adds that the atmosphere of the home is more nutritious than the food on the table. A simple vegetable meal with love is superior to a luxury feast served with bitterness.

[DYK] A "stalled ox" refers to a calf kept in a stall to be fattened for a special feast. It represented the height of luxury and wealth in ancient cuisine.

[ILL] A house is built by hands, but a home is built by hearts. You can buy a house with money, but you cannot buy a happy home; that requires the currency of love and contentment.

Question: What circumstance makes a home—even a comfortable one—undesirable?

Biblical Answer: “It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.” (Prov. 21:19)

Deeper Insight: While the text specifically mentions a woman, the principle applies to any member of the household. Contentiousness (constant arguing and strife) destroys the sanctuary nature of the home. Solitude in a harsh "wilderness" is preferable to living in a comfortable house filled with an angry spirit.

[SN] Connection to Eden: The home and the Sabbath are often called the "twin institutions" of Eden that survived the Fall. Both were designed for rest, relationship, and communion with God. When strife enters the home, it disrupts this Edenic purpose.

Practical Application: How can we cultivate a happy home today?
• Recognize the home as God's creation, not just a social contract.
• Cherish family members as gifts ("heritage") from the Lord.
• Prioritize "love and herbs" (relationship) over "stalled oxen" (material luxury).
• Guard the atmosphere against contention; be a peacemaker.
