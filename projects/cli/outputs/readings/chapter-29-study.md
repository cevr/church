Study Title: The Importance of Sound Doctrine

Question: Is it enough for a person to be sincere in their beliefs, regardless of what those beliefs are?

Biblical Answer: “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” (2 Thessalonians 2:13)

Explanation: While sincerity is a virtue, it is not a substitute for truth. The Apostle Paul explains that salvation involves the work of the Holy Spirit combined with a belief in the truth. We must be sincere *about* the truth.

[ILL] A traveler may sincerely believe they are on the road to their home, but if they are on a road leading in the opposite direction, their sincerity will not bring them to their destination. The map (Truth) matters as much as the traveler’s intent (Sincerity).

Question: How can we know if a religious teaching is true?

Biblical Answer: “Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” (1 Thessalonians 5:21)

Explanation: God does not ask for blind credulity. He asks us to "prove"—or test—every teaching. We are to keep only what aligns with His standard.

Term Definition: To **"Prove"** in this context comes from a Greek term used for testing metals to see if they were genuine or counterfeit. We must test every sermon, book, or feeling against the standard of Scripture.

[DYK] In the early church, there was no central human authority to dictate dogma. Believers were expected to search the Scriptures daily to see if what the apostles taught was true (Acts 17:11). The responsibility to verify truth rests on the individual believer.

Question: Upon what foundation must all true doctrine be built?

Biblical Answer: “And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone.” (Ephesians 2:20)

Explanation: Our faith stands on two pillars: the writings of the Old Testament (the prophets) and the New Testament (the apostles), held together by Jesus Christ. If a teaching contradicts the prophets or the apostles, it is not built on the sure foundation.

Deeper Insight: A "cornerstone" was the first stone set in ancient construction. All other stones were aligned to it. If the cornerstone was straight, the building would stand; if not, it would collapse. All doctrine must align perfectly with the character and teachings of Jesus.

Question: Why is "doctrine" (teaching) the first priority of Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine...” (2 Timothy 3:16)

Explanation: Before Scripture corrects or instructs us in righteousness, it establishes *doctrine*—the framework of truth. Right living (righteousness) springs from right thinking (doctrine).

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: There is a modern tendency to say, "We don't need doctrine, we just need Jesus." However, without doctrine, we cannot know who Jesus is. Is He a created being? Is He God? Is He a Savior or just a teacher? Doctrine defines the Jesus we worship.

Question: Why is it urgent to stick to sound doctrine, especially in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

Explanation: The Bible predicts a time when people will reject truth because it is uncomfortable. They will seek teachers who tell them what they *want* to hear ("itching ears") rather than what they *need* to hear.

Term Definition: **"Fables"** (or myths) refer to religious inventions, traditions, or stories that lack the power of the gospel and the authority of Scripture.

Question: Does God accept worship based on human tradition?

Biblical Answer: “But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:9)

Explanation: Jesus warns that it is possible to worship "in vain" (uselessly). Worship becomes empty when we elevate human rules, traditions, or cultural preferences above the plain commandments of God.

[ILL] If a doctor prescribes a specific life-saving medicine, but the pharmacist decides to mix in their own homemade ingredients because they taste better, the medicine loses its power. God's Word is the prescription; human tradition is the dilution.

Question: What is the result of abiding in Jesus' true word?

Biblical Answer: “If ye continue in My word, then are ye My disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31, 32)

Explanation: True freedom comes from knowing the truth. Error binds us in confusion, fear, and sin. God’s truth liberates the mind and the conscience.

Question: Who will ultimately enter God’s kingdom?

Biblical Answer: “Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.” (Isaiah 26:2)

Explanation: The gates of the Holy City are opened not just to those who "know" the truth, but to those who "keep" it. Doctrine is meant to be lived.

Practical Application: How can we apply this study today?
• **Commit** to reading the Bible personally, not just listening to others.
• **Evaluate** everything you hear—even from the pulpit—against the Bible.
• **Ask** God for the courage to follow truth, even when it contradicts tradition or popular opinion.
• **Pray** specifically for the "knowledge of the doctrine" (John 7:17), claiming God's promise that He will reveal His will to those willing to obey it.
