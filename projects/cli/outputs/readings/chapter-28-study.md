Study Title: Bible Sanctification: Wholeness in Christ

Question: What is God’s specific will concerning the condition of His people?

Biblical Answer: “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

Explanation: God’s plan for humanity is not merely forgiveness, but transformation. He desires "sanctification," a process of being set apart for holy use and made pure in character.

Term Definition: **Sanctification** comes from the Greek word *hagiasmos*, meaning purification, consecration, or holiness. It implies a state of being distinct from the world and dedicated entirely to God.

Question: Is it possible for a person to accomplish this work of holiness by themselves?

Biblical Answer: “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” (John 15:5)

Explanation: Just as a branch cannot generate life if severed from the trunk, a human being cannot generate true holiness apart from Christ. Moral improvement without Jesus is merely modification of behavior; sanctification is the infusion of His life into ours.

[ILL] Consider a glove. On its own, a glove is limp and powerless to pick up a Bible or help a neighbor. But when a hand fills the glove, it becomes active and useful. We are the glove; Christ is the Hand.

Question: Through what medium or instrument does God perform this work in us?

Biblical Answer: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17, see also v.19)

Explanation: Sanctification is not a mystical feeling; it is an intelligent process brought about by the Word of God. As we receive, believe, and obey the Truth, the Truth changes us.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** This highlights the Protestant principle of *Sola Scriptura*. The Holy Spirit works *through* the Word, not independently of it. In the pioneer view, the more we understand the Bible, the more materials the Holy Spirit has to build a holy character within us.

Question: How much of the individual does true sanctification affect?

Biblical Answer: “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

Explanation: Biblical religion covers the entire person. It is not limited to our thoughts or prayers; it includes our physical habits, our health, and our intellect.

[DYK] The concept of the "whole man" is central to the biblical understanding of human nature. Unlike Greek philosophy, which often viewed the body as a prison for the soul, Scripture views the body as the temple of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, caring for one's health is a spiritual duty.

Question: How does this affect our daily choices, such as eating and drinking?

Biblical Answer: “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:31)

Explanation: Holiness is practical. It sits at the dinner table with us. If our bodies are to be "presented a living sacrifice" (Romans 12:1), then what we consume matters because it affects the brain—the very medium through which God communicates with us.

Question: What creates the condition for this change? How are we transformed?

Biblical Answer: “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Romans 12:2)

Explanation: The battle for sanctification is fought in the mind. By refusing to pattern ourselves after the world and instead allowing God to "renew" our thoughts, our external actions change naturally.

Term Definition: **Transformed** translates to *metamorphoo* (where we get "metamorphosis"). It describes a radical change of nature, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly.

Question: What is the cost of becoming a true disciple?

Biblical Answer: “So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.” (Luke 14:33)

Explanation: Sanctification requires total surrender. We cannot hold on to cherished sins or worldly ambitions and hold on to Christ at the same time. We must empty our hands of self so they can be filled with Him.

[SN] **Deeper Insight:** This "forsaking all" often includes a reordering of affections. As Matthew 10:37 notes, our love for Christ must exceed our love for father, mother, or children. This doesn't mean we love our family less, but that our love for them is purified and sustained by our supreme love for God.

Question: If we surrender all and face difficulties, is our connection to God secure?

Biblical Answer: “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life... nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39)

Explanation: While the standard of holiness is high, the security of the believer is found in the love of God. Sanctification is a lifelong journey, and as long as we abide in Him, no external force can sever that bond.

Practical Application:
1. **Abide:** Are you trying to be good on your own, or are you connecting with the Vine daily?
2. **Study:** Are you spending time in the Word, the medium of sanctification?
3. **Surrender:** Is there a habit (eating, entertainment, attitude) you need to "forsake" to be a living sacrifice?
