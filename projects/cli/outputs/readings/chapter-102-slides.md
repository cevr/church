Study Title: Origin, History, and Destiny of Satan

---

Slide 1 Question: Did sin originate with humanity, or did it exist before?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” (2 Peter 2:4)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Scripture reveals that sin did not begin on earth, but among the angelic host. There was a rebellion involving a specific group of angels led by a specific being.

[DYK] The word "Satan" is Hebrew for "Adversary" or "Opponent." The word "Devil" (Diabolos) is Greek for "Slanderer." These titles describe his character and actions, not just his name.

Slide 4 Question: Who is the leader of this rebellion, and what was his original state?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so... Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” (Ezekiel 28:14, 15)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Satan was not created as a devil. He was created as a "cherub"—a high-ranking angel. He was "perfect" and "anointed." God did not create evil; He created a free moral agent who chose to rebel.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a thoughtful angel turning his face slightly away from a divine light, symbolizing the beginning of an internal choice.

---

Slide 7 Definition: The "Covering Cherub" refers to the highest position an angel could hold. In the earthly sanctuary, two cherubim stood upon the Ark of the Covenant, their wings "covering" the mercy seat where God’s presence dwelt. Satan once stood in the immediate presence of God’s law and glory.

[ILL] Imagine a trusted prime minister standing right beside the king's throne, entrusted with the secrets of the kingdom. This was Lucifer’s position before he became a traitor.

Slide 8 Question: What happened to cause his fall, and where is he now?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic streak of lightning cutting through a dark sky, symbolizing a rapid descent.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” (Luke 10:18) “He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.” (John 8:44)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fallen figure landing on a shadowed earth, looking upward with a mixture of regret and malice.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Because of pride and violence, he was cast out of the "mountain of God." He could no longer abide in the truth. Since then, he has brought his rebellion to this world, deceiving humanity.

[SN] Spirit-led insight: The phrase "abode not in the truth" implies that truth is a dwelling place. When Satan left the truth, he left his home. Now, his only weapon is the "lie" (Gen 3:4), which he uses to distort God's character to the world.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a serpent or shadowy figure whispering into the ear of a person, symbolizing the introduction of the lie.

---

Slide 11 Question: Who is Satan's specific target in the last days?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a woman clothed in white standing firm against a dark, stormy background.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “And the dragon [Satan] was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelation 12:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dragon silhouette looming over a small group of faithful people holding scrolls, lit by a beam of divine light.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: Satan is angry with the "woman" (a symbol for the church). His wrath is focused on the "remnant"—the last generation of believers who maintain two distinct characteristics: they keep God's commandments and hold the testimony of Jesus.

[DYK] Throughout history, the "dragon" has used various earthly powers to persecute God's people, from pagan Rome to the religious powers of the Middle Ages. In the end times, the focus is on those who refuse to compromise God's law.

Slide 14 Question: How will Satan deceive the world just before the end?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a mysterious figure performing a dazzling wonder in the sky, while people watch in awe.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do...” (Revelation 13:14) “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles...” (Revelation 16:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of fire coming down from the sky in a false imitation of Elijah's offering, surrounded by a deceived crowd.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: In the final conflict, Satan will use supernatural deception. Miracles, signs, and wonders will be performed to validate false worship. Faith must be rooted in the Bible rather than in sensory experience.

Slide 17 Question: What is the ultimate destiny of Satan? Will he reign in hell forever?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a desolate landscape with smoke rising, signifying final judgment.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee... thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be anymore.” (Ezekiel 28:18, 19) “And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.” (Revelation 20:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of divine fire cleansing the earth, leaving only ashes where evil once stood.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Satan is not the king of hell, nor will he torture souls for eternity. The Bible teaches that he will be "devoured" and turned to "ashes." His destiny is total destruction and non-existence.

[SN] Theological Note: This truth vindicates God’s character. A God of love does not perpetuate evil through eternal torture. Instead, He eventually removes the cancer of sin entirely, leaving a clean universe where "affliction shall not rise up the second time" (Nahum 1:9).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a serene, renewed earth with no trace of darkness or fire, symbolizing the peace after the destruction of sin.

---

Slide 20 Practical Application: Since we have an adversary seeking to devour like a roaring lion, what is our defense?

• Be sober and vigilant (stay alert)
• Resist him steadfast in the faith
• Keep the commandments of God
• Rely on the victory Jesus already won.
