Study Title: The Two Laws: Moral and Ceremonial

Question: By what standard will all humanity ultimately be judged?

Biblical Answer: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment... whether it be good or whether it be evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14); “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” (James 2:12)

Explanation: The Bible establishes a law that is the standard for judgment. This law encompasses the "whole duty of man" and is described by James as a "law of liberty." It defines our moral obligation to God.

[DYK] In the Hebrew text of Ecclesiastes, "whole duty of man" literally reads "this is the whole man." The implication is that our very purpose and wholeness are found in alignment with God's will.

Question: Is there a different law that was temporary and is no longer binding?

Biblical Answer: “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross... Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” (Colossians 2:14–17)

Explanation: This passage speaks of a law contained in "ordinances" (religious rules regarding sacrifices, food offerings, and festivals). These were "shadows" pointing forward to Jesus. Once the "body" (the reality, which is Christ) arrived, the shadows were no longer needed.

Term Definition: **"Handwriting of Ordinances"** refers to the ceremonial laws written by Moses, distinct from the Moral Law written by God.
**"Shadow"** implies a silhouette cast by an object. The ceremonial services were a silhouette of the work Jesus would do.

Question: How does the Bible distinguish between the content and purpose of these two laws?

Biblical Answer:
*   **The Moral Law (Nature):** “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” (Psalm 19:7). It defines sin: “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.” (1 John 3:4).
*   **The Ceremonial Law (Nature):** “The law of commandments, contained in ordinances.” (Ephesians 2:15). It deals with offerings: “...If any man of you bring an offering...” (Leviticus 1:2).

Progressive Disclosure:
*   **Moral Law:** Existed before the fall (Adam’s transgression implies a law was broken), defines our relationship to God and man (Matthew 22:37-39), and converts the soul.
*   **Ceremonial Law:** Introduced *after* sin entered as a remedial system (Hebrews 9:9-10). It involved sacrifices and rites that could not make a person perfect but pointed to the Perfect One.

[ILL] Consider a mirror and a basin of water. The Moral Law is like a mirror; it reveals the dirt (sin) on our face but cannot wash it off. The Ceremonial Law was like a basin of water (sacrifices); it offered a method of cleansing that represented the future cleansing blood of Christ.

Question: How were these two laws delivered differently, highlighting their difference in duration?

Biblical Answer:
*   **Moral Law:** “The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire... and He declared His covenant... even ten commandments.” (Deuteronomy 4:12, 13). “He wrote them in two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy 5:22).
*   **Ceremonial Law:** “And the Lord called unto Moses... saying, Speak unto the children of Israel...” (Leviticus 1:1, 2). “...laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant.” (Nehemiah 9:14).

Explanation: The Moral Law was spoken by God directly to the people and written on **stone**, symbolizing its unchangeable, eternal nature. The Ceremonial Law was given to Moses to write in a **book**, symbolizing its temporary, instructional nature until the "time of reformation" (Hebrews 9:10).

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The distinction in writing materials is significant. In the ancient Near East, royal decrees meant to last forever were often inscribed on rock (stelae), while administrative or temporary records were written on parchment or clay tablets. God writing on stone signifies the immutable nature of His character.

Question: How did Jesus treat these two laws?

Biblical Answer:
*   **Moral Law:** “The Lord is pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the Law, and make it honorable.” (Isaiah 42:21). Jesus said, “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:18).
*   **Ceremonial Law:** “Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.” (Ephesians 2:15).

Deeper Insight: Jesus did not destroy the Moral Law; He "magnified" it by showing that it applies to our thoughts and motives, not just our actions (see Matthew 5). However, by dying on the cross, He fulfilled the system of types and shadows. The veil of the temple was torn, signaling the end of the ceremonial system.

Question: Does the Sabbath belong to the temporary ceremonial law or the eternal moral law?

Biblical Answer: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.” (Genesis 2:2, 3).

Explanation: The Sabbath was established at Creation, *before* sin entered the world. Since the ceremonial law was introduced *after* sin as a remedy and shadow, the Creation Sabbath cannot be a shadow. It is part of the Moral Law, made for humanity’s benefit from the beginning.

[DYK] The "sabbath days" mentioned in Colossians 2:16 that were "nailed to the cross" refer to the yearly ceremonial sabbaths (feasts) tied to specific dates (like the Passover or Day of Atonement), which fell on different days of the week each year. These are distinct from the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath written on stone.

Practical Application:
*   **Guidance:** We look to the Moral Law (Ten Commandments) to understand God’s will for our conduct.
*   **Faith:** We look away from earthly sacrifices and rituals, trusting solely in the finished work of Jesus (the fulfillment of the Ceremonial Law) for our salvation.
*   **Rest:** We keep the Sabbath not as a shadow of salvation, but as a memorial of Creation and a celebration of God's power.
