---

Slide 1 Question: How does Scripture distinguish the true God from all false gods?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The Lord is the true God, He is the living God, and an everlasting king... The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish... He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom.” (Jeremiah 10:10-12)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The primary distinction of the true God is His power to create. While false gods are the works of men's hands, the Living God is the Architect of reality itself.

---

Slide 4 Context: [DYK] In the ancient world, every nation had its own deities. The God of Israel claimed supremacy not merely as a tribal protector, but as the physical Originator of the universe.

---

Slide 5 Question: What specific reason does the Fourth Commandment give for keeping the Sabbath holy?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day.” (Exodus 20:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pristine Garden of Eden at sunset on the seventh day, depicting perfect peace and rest.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The Sabbath is the great memorial of creative power. God designed it so humanity would have a weekly reminder of their origins. Just as we celebrate birthdays to remember our beginning, the Sabbath celebrates the beginning of the world.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: [ILL] If you build a magnificent house, you might place a cornerstone with the date and the builder's name. The Sabbath is God’s "cornerstone" in time—a permanent marker that identifies who built the world and when.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stone mason setting a large, inscribed cornerstone into the foundation of a temple, soft light highlighting the inscription.

---

Slide 9 Question: Beyond remembering Creation, what does the Sabbath signify about our relationship with God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer standing in a field at dusk, hands raised in reverent prayer, looking toward the heavens.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.” (Exodus 31:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Pillar of Cloud resting over the Tabernacle, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The Sabbath is a "sign" indicating that a person worships the true Creator. It is also a sign of *sanctification*—the process by which God makes us holy. By setting aside a holy day, we acknowledge that we are His people, set apart from the world.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a priest lighting the menorah in the Holy Place, soft golden light reflecting on the sacred vessels.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: "Sanctify" comes from a root meaning "to cut" or "to separate." It means to set something apart for a holy use. God sanctified the seventh day (set it apart), and He sanctifies the people who keep it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a harvest scene where wheat is being carefully separated from chaff, symbolizing being set apart.

---

Slide 13 Question: In the book of Deuteronomy, what additional reason is given for Sabbath observance?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elder reading from an ancient scroll to a younger generation, soft light illuminating their faces.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand... therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.” (Deuteronomy 5:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, walls of water on either side, walking toward freedom.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Here, the motivation shifts from Creation to *Redemption*. The Israelites were slaves who had no rest; God delivered them into freedom. The Sabbath is a weekly celebration of freedom from Pharaoh (for Israel) and freedom from sin (for the Christian).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of broken chains lying on the ground, illuminated by a shaft of light from an open door.

---

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Egyptian bondage illustrates the bondage of sin. Just as the Israelites could not keep God’s law perfectly while under the whip of Pharaoh, we cannot serve God while enslaved by sin. The Sabbath reminds us that God is the Deliverer who breaks our chains.

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangent: Note the harmony: Exodus 20 points to God's *power* (Creation). Deuteronomy 5 points to God's *love* (Redemption). We worship Him because He made us, and because He saved us.

Slide 17 Question: What was God’s original plan for how the Sabbath should be used?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a peaceful village scene on the Sabbath, no work being done, a sense of calm pervading the image.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation.” (Leviticus 23:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a congregation of people gathered together in an open courtyard, listening to the reading of the law.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The word "Sabbath" literally means *Rest*. However, it is not merely sleep or idleness. It is a "holy convocation" (assembly). God intended the day for physical refreshment, contemplation of the Creator, and public worship.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family sitting together under a tree, sharing food and conversation, looking relaxed and joyful.

---

Slide 20 Illustration: [ILL] Think of a battery charger. If you use a device constantly without recharging, it dies. The Sabbath is the spiritual charging station designed by the Manufacturer of humanity to restore our souls through connection with Him.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a weary traveler drinking from a refreshing spring of water, regaining strength.

---

Slide 21 Practical Application: In a fast-paced world that often forgets God, the Sabbath offers a sanctuary in time. By keeping it, we protest against atheism (acknowledging the Creator) and against salvation by works (resting in His finished redemption).
