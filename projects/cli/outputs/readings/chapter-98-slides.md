Study Title: God, Government, and Conscience

---

Slide 1 Question: What is the source of civil authority, and how should a Christian relate to it?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.” (Romans 13:1)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God is the Sovereign of the universe. He permits earthly governments to exist to maintain order, as anarchy is contrary to His character. Christians are called to be exemplary citizens, respecting civil office and abiding by the law.

Slide 4 Did You Know?
In Romans 13, the ruler is called a "minister of God." The Greek word is *diakonos* (servant). Even secular leaders serve a divine purpose by curbing evil and protecting society from chaos.

Slide 5 Question: Did Jesus distinguish between our duty to the government and our duty to God?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's.” (Matthew 22:21)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Christ established a boundary between two distinct spheres: the civil (Caesar) and the spiritual (God). We owe the government taxes, honor, and compliance. However, we owe God our worship, supreme love, and conscience. The state has no jurisdiction over the soul.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: The Two Mailboxes
Imagine two distinct boxes. You place tax returns in the government's box; it belongs to them. But your prayers, worship, and heart loyalty belong in God's box. To give Caesar what belongs to God is idolatry; to deny Caesar his due in civil matters is rebellion.

Slide 9 Question: What must a believer do if the civil government passes a law that contradicts the Law of God?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter and the apostles standing boldly and respectfully before the Jewish Sanhedrin.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: When the "higher powers" of earth conflict with the "Highest Power" of heaven, loyalty remains with God. The apostles were forbidden to preach in Jesus' name. Because this contradicted Christ’s commission, they respectfully but firmly disobeyed the human order.

Slide 12 Definition: Conscience
The internal sense of what is right or wrong in one's conduct or motives, impelling one toward right action. For the Christian, the conscience is bound by the Word of God.

Slide 13 Spirit-Led Insight
History is filled with this tension. In Daniel 3, the issue was *forced worship* (the image). In Daniel 6, it was *forbidden worship* (prayer). Believers remained loyal citizens in civil matters but refused to compromise in religious matters, proving the state cannot legislate worship.

Slide 14 Question: Why is it dangerous for any human power to insert itself between a soul and God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lone figure walking on a vast plain toward a massive, divine light, signifying an individual journey.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “So then everyone of us shall give account of himself to God.” (Romans 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the judgment seat, solemn and majestic, with a single soul standing before the Creator.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Judgment is personal. No king, governor, or magistrate can answer for your soul in the final judgment. Therefore, no ruler has the right to dictate your faith. We are individually accountable to God and must be free to follow His Word.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an earthly king standing humbly without his crown, looking up, acknowledging he is but a man before God.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight
Ecclesiastes 5:8 reminds us that “He that is higher than the highest regardeth.” While earthly rulers are "higher powers," God is the Supreme Ruler. When the state oversteps into religion, it attempts to usurp the throne of God.
