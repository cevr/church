Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.” (1 John 2:6)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Christian life is not merely about following a set of abstract rules, but following a Person. To "walk as He walked" means our lifestyle, decisions, and reactions should mirror the life of Jesus Christ.

Slide 4 Illustration: Imagine trying to learn a complex craft like woodworking. You can read a manual, or you can watch a master craftsman work and mimic his movements. Jesus is the Master Craftsman of life; we learn by watching and imitating Him.

Slide 5 Question: What specific examples did Jesus set for us in His earthly life?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer:
*   **In Obedience:** Subject to His parents (Luke 2:51).
*   **In Baptism:** Fulfilling all righteousness (Matthew 3:15).
*   **In Prayer:** Continuing all night in prayer (Luke 6:12).
*   **In Service:** Going about doing good (Acts 10:38).

Slide 7 Explanation: Jesus did not exempt Himself from human duties. He honored His parents, participated in religious rites to set a standard for us, relied on prayer for strength, and spent His energy serving others.

Slide 8 Did You Know?

[DYK] In Jewish culture, a son was expected to learn his father’s trade and uphold the family honor. Jesus, though the Creator of the universe, submitted to the authority of Joseph and Mary, sanctifying the ordinary duties of family life.

Slide 9 Question: How did Jesus respond when He was mistreated?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing amidst a shadowy, angry crowd, His expression calm and sorrowful rather than angry.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.” (1 Peter 2:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a close-up of Jesus' face, eyes looking upward, portraying peace amidst persecution.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Jesus broke the cycle of retaliation. Instead of defending Himself or striking back, He trusted the Father’s ultimate justice. He even prayed for His executioners: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."

Slide 12 Question: Is Jesus only an example, or does He actively help us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person reaching a hand up from a pit, with a strong hand reaching down to grasp it.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “For in that He himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted.” (Hebrews 2:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus placing a comforting hand on the shoulder of a weeping figure, soft and compassionate lighting.

---

Slide 14 Term Definition: **Succour**
An older English word meaning "to run to the aid of" or "to bring help to." It implies urgent, active assistance when someone is in distress or danger.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd running urgently toward a sheep caught near a dangerous ledge.

---

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: Because Jesus took on human nature, He knows exactly what temptation *feels* like. He is not a distant observer; He is an experienced veteran of the spiritual war who rushes to help us when we are under fire.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in the wilderness, looking weary but resolute, portraying the reality of His struggle against temptation.

---

Slide 16 Question: How complete is the salvation Jesus offers?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise over a vast ocean, symbolizing the boundless nature of grace.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.” (Hebrews 7:25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing in a heavenly setting, arms open, light radiating from Him.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: "To the uttermost" means entirely, completely, and for all time. There is no depth of sin He cannot reach, and no duration of time where His power fades. His salvation includes "keeping you from falling" and presenting you "faultless."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure in white robes standing spotless in a court of light, representing being presented faultless.

---

Slide 19 Speaker Note

[SN] The phrase "ever liveth to make intercession" points to Christ's current work in the heavenly sanctuary. Just as the high priest in the Old Testament bore the names of the tribes on his breastplate, Jesus bears our names before the Father today.

---

Slide 20 Question: How does Jesus define His relationship with His followers?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting around a fire with His disciples, laughing and talking intimately.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “Henceforth I call you not servants... I have called you friends.” (John 15:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking side-by-side with a disciple, engaging in deep conversation like brothers.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: A servant obeys out of obligation; a friend acts out of love and shared purpose. Jesus invites us into a relationship of intimacy where He shares His plans (the "mind of Christ") with us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two hands clasped together in a bond of friendship, soft warm light.

---

Slide 23 Illustration: A "fair-weather friend" disappears when trouble starts. But Scripture says Jesus is a friend that "sticketh closer than a brother" and is "born for adversity." He is most present when life is hardest.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: Since Jesus is our Pattern, Helper, and Friend:

*   **Pattern:** In a difficult situation today, ask, "How would Jesus handle this?"
*   **Helper:** When tempted, claim His promise to "succour" you immediately.
*   **Friend:** Speak to Him often, not just formally, but as a close companion walking by your side.
