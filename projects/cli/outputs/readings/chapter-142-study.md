Study Title: Reverence for the House of God

Question: How does the Lord regard things or places that have been dedicated to His service?

Biblical Answer: “Every devoted thing is most holy unto the Lord.” (Leviticus 27:28)

Explanation: When something is "devoted" or dedicated to God, its status changes from common (ordinary) to holy (set apart). It is no longer to be treated with the same casualness as everyday objects. This principle applies to the church building, the tithe, and the time set apart for worship.

[DYK] The Hebrew word often used for things devoted to God implies a separation so complete that the object cannot be redeemed for personal use again. It belongs exclusively to the Divine.

Question: How did Jesus demonstrate the sanctity of God’s house during His earthly ministry?

Biblical Answer: “And Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple... And He taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.” (Mark 11:15-17)

Explanation: Jesus took immediate, decisive action to clear the temple of commercial traffic. He re-established the purpose of the building: it was not a place for transaction or profit, but a place for communion with the Father.

[ILL] Imagine inviting a guest to your home, but the living room is so full of noisy vendors and merchandise that your guest has nowhere to sit and cannot hear you speak. This is what the religious leaders had done to God’s house—cluttering the place of worship with the noise of business.

Question: Was the sanctity of the "House of God" intended only for the Jewish people?

Biblical Answer: “For mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.” (Isaiah 56:7)

Explanation: God’s design has always been inclusive. The sanctity of His house is a gift to "all nations" and "all people." Even the "sons of the stranger" are invited to find joy in His house of prayer.

[SN] Spirit-led insight: In the temple layout, the buying and selling Jesus stopped was taking place in the "Court of the Gentiles." This was the *only* place non-Jews could come to pray. By filling it with livestock and money changers, the priests were literally blocking the Gentiles' access to God. Jesus’ zeal was not just for the building, but for the people being shut out.

Question: What makes a gathering or a place holy today?

Biblical Answer: “For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” (Matthew 18:20)

Explanation: While brick and mortar are dedicated to God, the true holiness comes from the presence of Christ among His people. If He is present, the ground becomes holy, just as it did for Moses at the burning bush or Joshua outside Jericho.

Question: If Christ is present, how should we conduct ourselves?

Biblical Answer: “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God.” (Ecclesiastes 5:1); “Serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.” (Hebrews 12:28)

Term Definition: **"Keep thy foot"**: This is an idiom meaning "watch your step" or "proceed with caution and attention." It implies preparing one’s heart before entering, leaving worldly distractions outside, and entering with a deliberate focus on listening to God.

[ILL] When entering a courtroom or the office of a head of state, our demeanor changes naturally—we lower our voices, we pay attention, and we show respect. How much more should we do this when entering the presence of the King of Kings?

Question: What creates a proper atmosphere for worship?

Biblical Answer: “But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy; and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.” (Psalm 5:7)

Progressive Disclosure: • Recognition of God’s mercy (Grace) • A sense of holy fear (Awe) • Direction of the heart (Focus)

Deeper Insight: David combines "mercy" and "fear." We do not tremble in terror because of His mercy, but we do not act casually because of His majesty. True reverence is the balance of love and awe.

[SN] Optional tangent for Spirit-led expansion: • The connection between "Reverence My sanctuary" and "Keep My Sabbaths" (Lev. 19:30) suggests that time (Sabbath) and space (Sanctuary) are twin cathedrals of God's presence. • The historic SDA view that our behavior in church reflects our understanding of Christ's high priestly ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary. • Avoiding common business discussion in the sanctuary on Sabbath (Isaiah 58:13).

Practical Application: How can we show reverence this week? • Arriving on time to compose our hearts • Refraining from secular conversation in the sanctuary • Dressing in a way that honors the Host • Teaching children that the church is a special place to meet Jesus.
