Study Title: Connecting with Heaven: Answers to Prayer

Question: Why did Jesus give us the parable of the persistent widow?

Biblical Answer: “And He spoke a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint.” (Luke 18:1)

Explanation: The primary purpose of this parable is to encourage consistency. The word "faint" here implies losing heart, becoming discouraged, or giving up due to weariness. Jesus teaches that prayer is the antidote to spiritual exhaustion.

[DYK] In the parable (Luke 18:2-5), the widow had to plead with an unjust judge who feared neither God nor man. Jesus uses a "lesser to greater" argument: If a corrupt human judge will eventually answer due to persistence, how much more will a loving Father answer His own children?

Question: What is the essential condition of heart when we ask God for our needs?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.” (Mark 11:24)

Explanation: Faith is not merely hoping; it is the assurance of receiving. The text suggests a present reality ("believe that ye receive") which results in a future manifestation ("ye shall have them").

Question: What happens if we pray while doubting God’s willingness or ability?

Biblical Answer: “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any-thing of the Lord.” (James 1:6, 7)

[ILL] Imagine trying to fill a cup that is constantly shaking and spilling its contents. A "wavering" heart is unstable. Just as a wave has no solid foundation and is pushed entirely by the wind, a doubting prayer is pushed by circumstances rather than anchored in God’s promises.

Question: Is there a connection between our obedience to God and His answering of our prayers?

Biblical Answer: “And whatsoever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.” (1 John 3:22)

Explanation: There is a harmony between the will of the petitioner and the will of the Giver. Prayer is not a way to change God’s mind while we remain in rebellion; rather, obedience brings our life into the atmosphere where God can safely and freely bless.

Term Definition: "Abomination" (found in Prov. 28:9) — Something morally detestable or disgusting. Scripture warns that "he who turns away his ear from hearing the law," yet tries to pray, offers a prayer that is repulsive to God because it is insincere.

[SN] The connection between *Law* and *Prayer* is vital in Adventist theology. We do not obey to earn God's favor (legalism), but because we love Him. If we deliberately ignore His counsel (His Law), we sever the line of communication. A heart at war with God's government cannot be at peace in His presence.

Question: Can my relationship with other people hinder my relationship with God?

Biblical Answer: “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any... But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.” (Mark 11:25, 26)

Deeper Insight: The Bible also notes that domestic conflict specifically hinders prayer. Husbands and wives are warned to dwell in knowledge and honor together so "that your prayers be not hindered" (1 Peter 3:7). Friction in the home creates static in our communication with Heaven.

Question: What are the specific subjects God invites us to bring to Him in prayer?

Biblical Answer: [Summarized from various texts provided]
1. **Spiritual Restoration:** Forgiveness of sin (1 John 5:16) and the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13).
2. **Guidance & Protection:** Wisdom (James 1:5) and deliverance from danger (Ps. 91).
3. **Physical Needs:** Healing of the sick (James 5:14-15) and temporal prosperity (Zech. 10:1).
4. **Intercession for Others:** For ministers (Eph. 6:18), rulers (Ezra 6:10), and the persecuted (Heb. 13:3).
5. **The Great Hope:** For the vindication of God's cause (1 Kings 18) and the coming of Christ (Rev. 22:20).

[SN] Note the breadth of prayer: It ranges from the personal ("healing") to the cosmic ("vindicate His cause"). Early Adventists placed special emphasis on praying for the "Latter Rain" (Zech 10:1) and the Second Coming, viewing prayer as the engine that moves the work of God forward to its conclusion.

Question: If the answer does not come immediately or in the way we expect, what should we do?

Biblical Answer: “Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for Him.” (Psalm 37:7)

Explanation: Silence from God is not a denial. "Resting" implies a cessation of anxiety. We trust that God’s timing is perfect and that He reserves the right to answer in the way that best serves our eternal good.

Practical Application: To prepare for answered prayer, check your heart today: • Is there a known duty I am neglecting? • Is there someone I need to forgive? • Is there a promise I need to claim with unwavering faith?
