Study Title: The Two Families: Earthly Types and Spiritual Realities

Question: How can a mother bind the hearts of her family together?

Biblical Answer: “She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of kindness.” (Proverbs 31:26)

Explanation: The atmosphere of the home is largely determined by the tone of the speech used within it. Wisdom creates stability, but kindness creates the bond. The “law of kindness” implies that kindness is not merely an occasional impulse, but the ruling principle of the household.

[DYK] Proverbs 31 is an acrostic poem in Hebrew, where each verse begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. It was traditionally memorized to teach the ideal attributes of wisdom in action within the home.

Question: Is there a mutual obligation between parents and children in a godly home?

Biblical Answer: “Children, obey your parents in the Lord... And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.” (Ephesians 6:1, 4)

Term Definition: **Nurture and Admonition**: "Nurture" implies training through discipline and action; "admonition" implies training through words and instruction. A balanced home requires both example and teaching.

[ILL] A garden requires both a fence for protection (discipline) and water for growth (nurture). If you only have the fence, nothing grows; if you only have water without protection, the wild animals (the world) destroy the crop.

Question: Moving from the earthly home to the spiritual realm, what two families exist in the world?

Biblical Answer: “The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom, but the tares are the children of the wicked one.” (Matthew 13:38) ... “In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil.” (1 John 3:10)

Explanation: While there are many nations, races, and earthly families, spiritually there are only two lineages. Every human being belongs either to the family of God or the family of the enemy. There is no neutral ground.

Question: How do we identify the true children of God?

Biblical Answer: “He that hath My commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth Me... and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him.” (John 14:21)

Progressive Disclosure: • Love is the root • Obedience is the fruit • Divine manifestation is the result.

Deeper Insight: Obedience is not a method to *earn* entrance into the family, but the natural characteristic of those who *are* in the family. Just as a child shares the DNA of their earthly father, a child of God shares the character (Law) of their Heavenly Father.

[SN] **The Great Controversy Context**: This binary distinction—children of God vs. children of the Devil—reflects the cosmic conflict. In the beginning, God established a family in Eden. Satan attempted to hijack this family. The plan of redemption is essentially God winning back His children. The defining mark of the loyal family is adherence to the Father's will (His Commandments), just as Christ was obedient to the Father.

Question: How can we distinguish between a genuine child of God and a counterfeit?

Biblical Answer: “Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” (2 Timothy 3:5) ... “They profess that they know God, but in works, they deny Him...” (Titus 1:16)

Question: What is the ultimate test?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matthew 7:20)

[ILL] You can tie an apple onto a dead stick, and it may look like an apple tree from a distance (a form of godliness). But a living apple tree produces the fruit naturally from the inside out because of the life in the sap (the Holy Spirit).

Question: If we find we are "children of wrath" by nature, how do we change families?

Biblical Answer: “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.” (James 4:7, 8)

Explanation: Changing families requires a transfer of allegiance. We must stop submitting to the "wicked one" and submit to the Father. This is an act of the will, empowered by God’s grace.

Question: How does God feel about adopting us into His family?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.” (1 John 3:1)

[SN] **The Concept of Adoption**: In Roman law (the context of the New Testament), an adopted son had all the legal rights of a natural-born son, and his previous debts were canceled. When we accept the "manner of love" God bestows, our past debt of sin is wiped away, and we become full heirs.

Question: What is the final destiny of the two families?

Biblical Answer: For the wicked: “The wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.” (Psalm 37:10). For God's family: “And every creature... heard I saying, Blessing and honor and glory and power be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne.” (Revelation 5:13)

Deeper Insight: The text indicates that the wicked "shall not be." This aligns with the truth that sin and sinners are not eternal. God’s universe will eventually be cleansed, leaving only one united family praising Him forever.

Practical Application:
1.  **Home Check**: Is the "law of kindness" ruling our earthly homes today?
2.  **Heart Check**: Do our "fruits" (actions/obedience) prove we belong to the Family of God?
3.  **Action**: If you feel far from God, He says, "Draw nigh to Me." The invitation is open (Rev 22:17).
