Study Title: God’s Memorial: Remembering the Creator

Question: What is a “memorial,” and how long does God intend His memorial to last?

Biblical Answer: “Thy name, O Lord, endureth forever; and thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations.” (Psalm 135:13)

Explanation: A memorial is anything intended to preserve the memory of a person or an event—like a monument or a special day. Just as we build monuments to remember significant historical events, God has established a memorial so that His nature and authority are remembered by every generation.

[DYK] In the Bible, physical objects were sometimes used as memorials. When Israel crossed the Jordan River, Joshua set up twelve stones so that future children would ask, "What mean these stones?" (Joshua 4:21-22). God often uses physical symbols to teach spiritual truths.

Question: Does God specifically design His works of creation to be remembered?

Biblical Answer: “The works of the Lord are great... He hath made His wonderful works to be remembered.” (Psalm 111:2, 4)

Term Definition: “Wonderful works” here refers to the miracles of God's creation and providence. God does not want His creative power to be forgotten.

[ILL] An artist signs their painting so everyone knows who created it. In a similar way, God has placed a "signature" on His creation to remind us that He is the Maker.

Question: What specific memorial did God give to humanity to ensure we remember Him as the Creator?

Biblical Answer: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:8, 11)

Explanation: The Sabbath is the only commandment that begins with the word "Remember." It points directly back to the creation week. By resting on the seventh day, we acknowledge that we are not self-made; we are creatures honoring our Creator.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note that God sanctified (made holy) a portion of *time*, not a place. Cathedrals can be destroyed and shrines can be lost, but time travels with us everywhere. The Sabbath is a "sanctuary in time" that cannot be torn down by human hands.

Question: Is the Sabbath only a memorial of Creation, or does it also signify a relationship with God?

Biblical Answer: “Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)

Progressive Disclosure: • It is a sign of authority (Creator) • It is a sign of relationship (My Sabbaths) • It is a sign of sanctification (God makes us holy)

[ILL] Just as a wedding ring is a visible sign of an exclusive relationship between a husband and wife, the Sabbath is a visible sign of the exclusive relationship between God and His people.

Question: Some claim the Sabbath was only for the Jewish nation. According to the New Testament, who are the "heirs" of Abraham's promises?

Biblical Answer: “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:29)

Explanation: The New Testament teaches that anyone who accepts Jesus Christ becomes part of spiritual Israel. Therefore, the "sign" between God and His people applies to all who belong to Christ.

[DYK] The Apostle James addressed his epistle to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad" (James 1:1), referring to the Christian church. The continuity of God's people remains unbroken from the Old Testament to the New.

Question: Will this memorial continue even after sin is destroyed, in the New Earth?

Biblical Answer: “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me... from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 66:22-23)

Deeper Insight: The Sabbath memorializes Creation. Since the fact that God created the universe will never change, the memorial of that fact will never cease. Even in the perfect world to come, we will gather weekly to honor the Source of our life.

[SN] In Revelation 4:11, the song of the redeemed is: "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory... for thou hast created all things." The theme of Creation is the song of eternity. The Sabbath is the weekly rhythm of that song.

Practical Application: How can we honor God's memorial this week? • By resting from our own labor • By acknowledging God as our Creator • By trusting in His power to sanctify us • By looking forward to the eternal rest in the New Earth.
