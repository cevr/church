Study Title: Victory in Jesus: Promises to the Overcomer

Question: What general promise does God give to those who overcome?

Biblical Answer: “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son.” (Revelation 21:7)

Explanation: To "overcome" means to conquer, vanquish, or be victorious. God promises that those who are victorious in the spiritual battle will not merely be subjects in His kingdom, but will be adopted as children—heirs to "all things."

[DYK] The Greek word translated as "overcome" in the New Testament is *nikao*. It is the root of the word *Nike*, meaning "victory." It implies a struggle that has been fought and won.

Question: What specifically must we overcome?

Biblical Answer: “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” (Romans 12:21); “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.” (1 John 5:4)

Explanation: The battle is against "evil" and "the world." In Scripture, "the world" often refers to the system of values, practices, and rebellions that stand in opposition to God's character. To overcome the world is to refuse to let sin rule over one’s life (1 John 3:9).

[ILL] A boat is designed to be in the water, but if the water gets *into* the boat, it sinks. Similarly, the Christian lives *in* the world, but overcomes by not letting the world’s principles get *into* their heart.

Question: Who gives us the power to overcome, and how is it achieved?

Biblical Answer: “But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Corinthians 15:57); “And they overcame him [Satan] by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony.” (Revelation 12:11)

Explanation: We cannot overcome sin by our own willpower alone. Victory is a gift bestowed through Jesus. It is achieved through two distinct elements:
1.  **The Blood of the Lamb:** Christ’s sacrifice which covers our past and breaks the power of sin.
2.  **The Word of Testimony:** Our active faith and confession of what God has done for us.

[SN] **The "Blood of the Lamb"**: This imagery draws directly from the Old Testament sanctuary service. Just as the blood of the sacrifice provided atonement for the sinner, Christ’s blood provides the legal right to victory over Satan’s accusations. In SDA theology, this connects deeply to the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, interceding for us to provide overcoming power.

Question: What are the specific rewards promised to the overcomer?

Biblical Answer: [Summarized from Revelation 2 & 3 and James 1:12]
• To eat of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7)
• Not be hurt by the second death (Rev. 2:11)
• To eat hidden manna and receive a white stone with a new name (Rev. 2:17)
• Power over the nations (Rev. 2:26)
• Clothed in white raiment; name kept in the book of life (Rev. 3:5)
• A pillar in the temple of God (Rev. 3:12)
• To sit with Christ on His throne (Rev. 3:21)
• A crown of life (James 1:12)

Term Definition: **"The Second Death"**: Revelation distinguishes between the first death (sleep, from which there is a resurrection) and the second death (eternal separation from God/non-existence). The overcomer has no fear of this final destruction.

[DYK] **The White Stone**: In ancient legal assemblies, a white stone was cast by a jury to signify "acquittal" or "not guilty," while a black stone signified condemnation. It was also used as an admission ticket to victory banquets. God giving a "white stone" symbolizes our full acquittal through Christ and our invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb.

Question: When do the overcomers receive these promises?

Biblical Answer: “And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.” (Hebrews 11:39-40); “For yet a little while, and He that shall come, will come, and will not tarry.” (Hebrews 10:37)

Explanation: The faithful of the past are resting in the grave, waiting. They have not yet received the final reward. The promises are realized at the Second Coming of Jesus, when the faithful of all ages are gathered together.

Deeper Insight: This highlights the corporate nature of salvation. We do not trickle into heaven one by one at death; rather, the entire family of God—from Adam to the last generation—will be "made perfect" together at the resurrection.

Question: What is the final condition of the overcomers?

Biblical Answer: “After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude... clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands... And all the angels... worshipped God.” (Revelation 7:9-11)

Explanation: The ultimate result is a countless multitude standing before the throne, restored, purified (white robes), and victorious (palms). Their focus is entirely on worshipping God and the Lamb.

Practical Application: Since we look forward to these promises, how should we live today? Scripture says we should be "diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot, and blameless" (2 Peter 3:14). • Are there "spots" of the world we need to wash in the blood of the Lamb today? • Are we relying on our own strength, or the victory of Jesus?
