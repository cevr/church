Slide 1 Question: What was the primary mission of Jesus Christ when He came to this earth?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:10)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus did not come merely to teach or to judge, but to rescue. Humanity had wandered away from its original purpose. Christ’s mission was a recovery operation to restore what was lost.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Prodigal Son returning, being embraced by the Father, symbolizing restoration and recovery.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The title "Son of Man" was Jesus' favorite way to refer to Himself. It emphasizes His connection to humanity and His role as our Representative and Kinsman-Redeemer.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting among ordinary fishermen and families, sharing a meal, emphasizing His humanity and connection to the people.

---

Slide 5 Question: Since we cannot earn our salvation, how do we become part of God's family?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking up toward the heavens with an expression of longing and hope, soft rays of light breaking through clouds.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people standing together, unified by a glowing cross in the center, symbolizing the family of God.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Entrance into God's family is not based on heritage or personal achievement, but on trust (faith) in what Jesus has done.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Roman centurion or a gentile kneeling respectfully, illustrating that heritage does not dictate salvation.

---

Slide 8 Term Definition: “Faith” is not merely intellectual agreement. It is an active trust—a transaction where we give our sinful lives to Christ and accept His righteous life in return.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two hands clasping firmly, symbolizing a covenant or a transaction of trust.

---

Slide 9 Question: How does the Bible describe the spiritual change that happens inside a believer?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure in deep contemplation or prayer, a soft light illuminating their face from within.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” (Titus 3:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a baptism scene in a river, water flowing clearly, symbolizing spiritual washing and new life.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The Bible calls this "regeneration." Because we were spiritually "dead" in sins, we needed more than improvement; we needed a resurrection. The Holy Spirit washes the mind and creates new spiritual life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dry, dead branch miraculously sprouting fresh green leaves and blossoms.

---

Slide 12 Illustration: A dirty mirror cannot wash itself; it needs an outside agent. The law acts as a mirror to show us the "dirt" of sin, but only the "washing of regeneration" by the Spirit can cleanse us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient polished bronze mirror reflecting a face, with a hand holding a cloth and water preparing to clean it.

---

Slide 13 Question: If we are saved by faith, does it matter how we live?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pathway diverging, one side dark and rocky, the other lit and smooth, symbolizing choices in life.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “For as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.” (James 2:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fruit tree heavy with good fruit, standing next to a withered, barren tree.

---

Slide 15 Progressive Disclosure:
*   Faith is the root.
*   Obedience is the fruit.
*   A living connection with God naturally produces a change in behavior.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the roots of a tree deep in the soil, connected visually to the vibrant fruit on the branches above.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: True, living faith results in a life that pleases God. A clear evidence of this new life is that we "love the brethren" (1 John 3:14).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of early Christians sharing food and goods with one another, displaying brotherly love.

---

Slide 17 Speaker Note: It is not legalism to obey; it is the natural pulse of a new heart. The Gospel regenerates the sinner so they can walk in harmony with the Law again.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Stone Tablets of the Ten Commandments bathed in a warm, golden light, appearing not as a burden but as a guide.

---

Slide 18 Question: The Bible speaks of "regeneration" for people, but what about the earth itself?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a landscape that looks weary, perhaps a desert or a storm-swept field, awaiting renewal.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “...In the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones...” (Matthew 19:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ seated on a majestic, glowing throne, surrounded by a renewed and glorious environment.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Jesus uses "regeneration" to describe the future renewal of the world. Just as individuals must be born again, the earth itself must be cleansed from the curse and restored.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a barren field transforming into a lush garden, the line of transformation clearly visible.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: Adam lost his dominion to Satan, but Christ’s blood bought back the "purchased possession" (Ephesians 1:14). Christ redeemed not only the sinner but the sinner's home—the earth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ holding a scroll or a globe, signifying His reclamation of the earth from darkness.

---

Slide 22 Question: What will be the final result of this cosmic regeneration?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise over a perfect landscape, the colors vibrant and hopeful.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him.” (Revelation 22:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the River of Life flowing from the throne of God, surrounded by eternal greenery and peace.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: The history of salvation ends where it began—in a garden, but better. The curse placed on the ground in Genesis 3 is fully reversed.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a peaceful garden scene reminiscent of Eden, with animals and humans living in harmony.

---

Slide 25 Speaker Note: The "Tree of Life": Barred in Genesis to prevent eternal misery; restored in Revelation to those washed by the Lamb. The story of Scripture is a complete circle of restoration.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a magnificent tree bearing twelve kinds of fruit, its leaves glowing with healing light.

---

Slide 26 Practical Application: Regeneration is a present reality and a future hope. We experience the Spirit's renewing today, while looking forward to the earth's renewal at Jesus' coming.
