Slide 2 Question: Why does death come to every human being?

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “In Adam all die.” (1 Corinthians 15:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam walking away from the Garden of Eden in the distance, shadows lengthening, historically respectful portrayal of sorrow and mortality.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Death is not a natural part of God’s original design. It is an intrusion caused by the Fall. Because all humanity descends from Adam, we share in the mortality that resulted from sin.

Slide 5 Did You Know? The name "Adam" in Hebrew (*Adamah*) relates to the ground or earth.

[DYK] This reminds us that we were formed from the dust, and because of the separation from the Tree of Life in Eden, we return to the dust.

Slide 6 Question: What is the condition of a person while they are in the grave?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” (Ecclesiastes 9:10)

---

Slide 8 Explanation: Rather than transitioning immediately to another realm of conscious existence, the Bible describes death as a state of total inactivity. There is no labor, no planning, and no mental activity.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a carpenter’s tools laying unused on a workbench at the end of the day, representing the cessation of labor.

Slide 9 Illustration: The Cessation of Function

[ILL] Consider a light bulb. When the power is switched off, the light doesn't go somewhere else; it simply ceases to exist until the power is restored. Similarly, when the breath of life returns to God, the conscious "soul" ceases to function until the resurrection.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an oil lamp where the flame has just been extinguished, a thin trail of smoke rising, signifying the end of the light.

Slide 10 Term Definition: “The Grave” (Hebrew: *Sheol*)

Definition: Generally refers to the unseen state of the dead or the resting place of the dead. It is not a place of consciousness or torment.

Slide 11 Question: Can those who have died praise God or continue to think?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a harp resting silently against a stone wall, no musician present to play it.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?” (Psalm 6:5); “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” (Psalm 146:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man looking up toward the heavens in prayer while alive, contrasted with the stillness of the earth below.

Slide 13 The Process of Death

1. The body returns to earth.
2. The breath (spirit) returns to God.
3. The thoughts (consciousness) perish immediately.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion:
• The Biblical metaphor of death as "sleep" used by Jesus (John 11:11-14)
• The necessity of a Resurrection: If we went straight to heaven at death, the resurrection would be unnecessary.
• Genesis 2:7 formula: Dust + Breath = Living Soul. (Therefore: Dust - Breath = Dead Soul/Corpse).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of dust motes floating in a shaft of light, symbolizing the separation of the physical element from the breath of life.

Slide 14 Deeper Insight: Safeguarding the Believer

Insight: If the dead have no "knowledge," then any appearance of spirits communicating with the living cannot be our loved ones, but are deceptions. This understanding protects us from spiritualism.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer turning away from dark, misty shadows and looking toward the clear light of an open Scripture scroll.

Slide 15 Practical Application: How should we live today?

1. Work with "might" and diligence now.
2. Cherish our relationship with God while we can consciously praise Him.
3. Place our hope in the future resurrection, not in death itself.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family gathering at a table, sharing bread and praising God in the warm glow of a lamp, seizing the moment of life.
