Study Title: The Grace of Meekness

Question: What class of persons has the Lord promised to guide and teach?

Biblical Answer: “The meek will He guide in judgment; and the meek will He teach His way.” (Psalm 25:9)

Explanation: The primary requirement for receiving divine guidance is not intellectual brilliance, but a teachable spirit. God cannot lead the proud because they believe they already know the way. Only those willing to be led—the meek—can be taught God’s way.

Term Definition: “Meekness” is defined as being mild of temper, not easily provoked or irritated, and given to forbearance under injuries. It is the opposite of a prideful or retaliatory spirit.

[DYK] The Greek concept of meekness (*praus*) was often used to describe a warhorse that had been broken in. It did not mean the horse was weak; it meant it had great strength that was now under the perfect control of its master.

Question: Who is the ultimate example of this grace, and what does He invite us to do?

Biblical Answer: “Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.” (Matthew 11:29)

Progressive Disclosure:
*   **The Invitation:** “Come unto Me”
*   **The Model:** Christ is “meek and lowly”
*   **The Result:** “Rest unto your souls”

Explanation: Jesus claims this trait for Himself. If the King of Kings is meek, it cannot be a degrading quality. By taking His yoke, we do not carry a heavy burden, but rather we learn the secret of soul-rest: surrendering the need to fight for our own supremacy.

[ILL] Imagine two oxen yoked together. If a young, inexperienced ox is yoked with a strong, seasoned ox, the younger one learns the pace and path of the elder. Jesus invites us into the yoke with Him so we can learn His gentleness and find rest from the exhaustion of pride.

Question: How does a meek spirit change the way we interact with others, specifically in evangelism and church discipline?

Biblical Answer:
*   **In Restoration:** “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.” (Galatians 6:1)
*   **In Witnessing:** “...be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.” (1 Peter 3:15)

Deeper Insight: True spirituality is evidenced by how we treat the fallen. Harshness drives the sinner further away; a spirit of meekness seeks to heal the wound. Furthermore, when defending the truth, we must do so without arrogance. A combatant spirit often overshadows the message of the Gospel.

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangent: Note the connection between Moses and Christ. Moses was the meekest man on earth (Numbers 12:3) and was a "type" of Christ (Deuteronomy 18:18). Both were leaders of Israel, both faced constant murmuring from the people they led, yet both interceded for the people rather than destroying them. This intercessory spirit is the heart of meekness.

Question: Instead of outward display, what does God value as true beauty?

Biblical Answer: “...even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” (1 Peter 3:4)

Explanation: The world values external adornment—gold, apparel, and elaborate style. God looks at the "hidden man of the heart." A spirit that is calm, gentle, and unresentful is considered a jewel of "great price" to Heaven.

Question: What is the future reward for the meek, and why must we seek it now?

Biblical Answer: “Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matthew 5:5) AND “Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth... seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.” (Zephaniah 2:3)

Explanation: It often seems the aggressive and proud possess the earth now, but their hold is temporary. The inheritance of the Earth made New is reserved for the gentle. Zephaniah exhorts us to "seek meekness"—even those who are already meek are called to seek it more.

Deeper Insight: The command to "seek meekness" implies that sanctification is a progressive work. We never reach a point where we have "enough" of Christ's character. As we approach the final judgment (the day of the Lord's anger against sin), the character of Christ is our only hiding place.

Practical Application:
*   **Conflict:** When provoked today, will I respond with irritation or forbearance?
*   **Learning:** Am I willing to admit I am wrong so God can teach me?
*   **Lifestyle:** Do I seek attention through outward things, or beauty through a quiet spirit?

God promises to beautify the meek with salvation (Psalm 149:4). Let us ask for this fruit of the Spirit today.
