Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.” (Prov. 3:27)

Slide 3 Explanation: Justice in the Bible is not merely refraining from doing harm; it is the active performance of good. If we have the ability to bless someone and we hold back, we violate the principle of God's kingdom.

Slide 4 Illustration: The Channel of Blessing

[ILL] Consider a water channel or pipe. Its purpose is not to store water but to convey it. If it blocks the flow, it becomes useless. Similarly, God blesses us so that we may be channels of blessing to others.

Slide 5 Question: What rule does Jesus give regarding how we judge and treat others?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Judge not, that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” (Matt. 7:1, 2)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: This is the law of reciprocity. The standard of criticism or mercy we apply to others establishes the standard by which God and others will deal with us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two men conversing in a marketplace, one gesturing with an open hand of mercy.

---

Slide 8 Did You Know?

[DYK] The phrase "what measure ye mete" draws imagery from the ancient marketplace. Grain was measured in containers; if a merchant filled the container loosely (cheating the buyer), he could expect others to treat him the same way.

Slide 9 Question: When others treat us poorly, are we permitted to pay them back?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing calm and peaceful while another figure gestures angrily, soft light protecting the peaceful one.

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Recompense to no man evil for evil.” (Rom. 12:17) ... “Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing.” (1 Peter 3:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a disciple offering a blessing, soft light surrounding them in a posture of humility.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The natural human reaction is retaliation. The spiritual reaction is blessing. To return evil for evil is to be overcome by evil; to return good for evil is to overcome it.

Term Definition: **Recompense**: To repay, reward, or compensate. In Scripture, this applies to both the wages of sin and the rewards of righteousness.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark storm cloud retreating as a warm, golden sun breaks through, symbolizing good overcoming evil.

Slide 12 Question: What fundamental law determines the reward we receive from God?

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” (Gal. 6:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a field at harvest time, golden wheat contrasting with tares, soft evening light.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Our future is determined by our present actions. This is not an arbitrary decision by God, but a natural result. Sowing acts of selfishness produces corruption, while sowing to the "Spirit" produces life everlasting.

Slide 15 Spirit-Led Insight

[SN] **Character Building**: This principle underscores the importance of *character building*. We are not saved by our works, but our works reveal our character. Every thought and act is a seed that contributes to the final harvest of character—the only treasure we take to the next world.

Slide 16 Question: Will God show partiality or favoritism in the final judgment?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king and a shepherd standing side-by-side looking toward a great light, devoid of earthly hierarchy.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “For there is no respect of persons with God.” (Rom. 2:11) ... “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Gen. 18:25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Throne of God seen from a distance, radiating pure, impartial white light.

---

Slide 18 Explanation & Definition

God’s judgment is perfectly just. He looks past wealth and status.

Term Definition: **Respect of persons**: From the Greek *prosōpolēmpsia*, meaning "receiving the face." It refers to judging by external masks. God never looks at the "mask," but always at the heart.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a human face reflected in a mirror, but a divine light reveals the heart within.

---

Slide 19 Question: Will there be a time when our character and destiny are fixed forever?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large, heavy wooden door slowly swinging shut, creating a sense of finality.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly.” (Rev. 22:11, 12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an angel holding a scroll that is rolled up and sealed, signifying the end of a decree.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: A solemn moment approaches when the door of opportunity closes. This text reveals that when Christ returns, character change is no longer possible. The "recompense" is given based on the character formed during probation.

---

Slide 22 Prophetic Context

[SN] **The Close of Probation**: Early Adventists compared this to the shutting of the Ark's door seven days before the flood. There is a moment in history when Christ's intercession ceases. This highlights the urgency of "today."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Noah’s Ark with the massive door shut tight, rain clouds gathering in the distance.

---

Slide 23 Question: Since all work will be tested, what is the urgent conclusion?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking up at the sky with a look of realization and urgency.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “For if... every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?” (Heb. 2:2, 3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing with open arms, offering a path of light out of darkness.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: The certainty of justice makes the offer of salvation precious. Since we have all "sown" sin, our only hope is the intervention of Jesus Christ, who took the "evil recompense" we deserved upon Himself.

Slide 26 Practical Application

Since we are sowing seeds every day, what are we planting?
*   **In our words**: Criticism or encouragement?
*   **In our actions**: Selfishness or service?
*   **In our time**: The temporal or the eternal?

God has set before us "life and good, and death and evil" (Deut. 30:15). Choose life today.
