Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.” (Deuteronomy 23:21)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: A vow is a solemn pledge made to God. God views these promises with utmost seriousness. To "slack" means to delay or be lazy in fulfilling a duty. Once a promise is spoken, we are held accountable.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, spoken words were considered to have actual power and substance. A vow was not just an intention; it was a binding legal transaction between a person and their deity.

Slide 4 Question: Is a partial fulfillment of a promise acceptable to God?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.” (Numbers 30:2)

Slide 6 Explanation: Integrity requires wholeness. God expects us to do "according to all" that we have promised, not just the parts that are convenient.

Term Definition: "Bind his soul" implies that a vow restricts one's freedom. You are no longer free to do as you please with the time, money, or service promised; it now belongs to God.

Slide 7 Question: Why is it better to remain silent than to make a rash promise?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error...” (Ecclesiastes 5:5, 6)

Slide 9 Insights:
*   Vowing is voluntary.
*   Breaking a vow is a sin.
*   Rash words bring God's displeasure.
*   Honesty is better than impressive but empty promises.

[ILL] Imagine signing a contract to buy a house without checking if you have the money. It leads to ruin. Similarly, making spiritual vows without "counting the cost" leads to spiritual bankruptcy.

Slide 10 Question: What example of a vow do we see in the life of Jacob?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me... then shall the Lord be my God... and of all that thou shalt give me, I will surely give the tenth unto thee.” (Genesis 28:20-22)

Slide 12 Explanation: Jacob’s vow was a response to God’s grace. He promised loyalty and a tithe. Years later, God reminded him of this vow, and Jacob faithfully fulfilled it by purging idols and building an altar.

[SN] Jacob called the place of his vow "Bethel" (House of God). This establishes the principle that supporting God’s house is often connected to the faithful payment of vows and tithes.

Slide 13 Question: Does the quality of our offering matter to God?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts...” (Malachi 1:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a majestic King on a high throne, radiating authority and demanding reverence.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Offering "corrupt" things—like sick animals, or leftover time—betrays a lack of reverence. Because everything comes from Him, He deserves the very best, not the refuse.

Deeper Insight: We are "bought with a price" (1 Cor 6:19-20). Our bodies and resources are God's property entrusted to our stewardship.

Slide 16 Question: What is the result of faithful obedience in tithes and vows?

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse... and prove Me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing...” (Malachi 3:10)

---

Slide 18 Explanation: God invites us to "prove" (test) Him. He promises that faithfulness in stewardship opens the way for spiritual and temporal blessings that we cannot contain.

Slide 19 Question: If we face hardship despite our faithfulness, what should be our attitude?

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Although the fig tree shall not blossom... and there shall be no herd in the stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” (Habakkuk 3:17-18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophet kneeling in a rocky landscape, hands raised in praise despite the desolation around him.

Slide 21 Explanation: Our faithfulness is not a transaction to buy off trouble, but a relationship of love. Whether in prosperity or adversity, the faithful believer rejoices in God Himself, not just His gifts.
