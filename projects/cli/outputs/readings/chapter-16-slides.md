Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus clarifies that His mission is a rescue mission. Just as a doctor cannot heal a patient who refuses to admit they are sick, the Savior calls those who recognize their need. This call extends to "all nations" (Luke 24:47).

Slide 7 Explanation: The Law of God functions like a mirror. A mirror reveals dirt on the face, but it cannot wash it off. The Law reveals our moral condition, while the Holy Spirit presses this conviction upon the heart.

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine traveling a path without guideposts; you wouldn't know if you were lost.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul writing on parchment by candlelight, his expression earnest and instructive.

Slide 11 Explanation: Worldly sorrow regrets getting caught or suffering a loss of reputation. It is focused on self-preservation.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Judas turning away in anguish, clutching silver coins, his face shadowed by despair.

Slide 12 Explanation: Godly sorrow breaks the heart because the sin has grieved a loving God. This genuine sorrow leads to a change in behavior.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter weeping bitterly outside a courtyard, bathed in moonlight, realizing his denial of Christ.

Slide 13 Term Definition: "Contrite" (Isaiah 66:2). This describes a spirit that is crushed by the weight of its own guilt, yet relies entirely on God’s mercy. God is drawn to this humility.

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Paul preaching to the Ephesian elders, gesturing with one hand to the heavens and the other to his heart.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: We exercise repentance toward God because we broke His law. We exercise faith toward Jesus because He paid the penalty. Looking at Jesus—His love and sacrifice—melts the heart and makes true repentance possible.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer kneeling at the foot of the cross, their face illuminated by the light radiating from the Savior.

---

Slide 17 Speaker Notes: Law and Grace are not enemies. The Law points out the debt, and Christ pays it.

[SN] We cannot manufacture repentance on our own; it is a gift received by beholding the Lamb of God.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a basket overflowing with grapes, figs, and pomegranates, resting on a stone altar.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: True repentance produces external evidence. A "new heart" leads to a new life. The changed heart naturally produces actions that align with God's will.

[DYK] "Fruits meet for repentance" can be translated as "answerable to amendment of life." Your lifestyle answers your confession.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man formerly known as a thief returning a stolen cloak to its owner, both faces showing peace.

Slide 21 Question: What is the promise if we confess our sins?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavy storm cloud breaking apart to reveal a brilliant shaft of sunlight striking the earth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a High Priest in the temple sprinkling blood on the altar, symbolizing cleansing and atonement.

Slide 23 Explanation: God is "faithful" (He keeps His promise) and "just" (Christ paid the price, so payment is not demanded twice). The blood of Jesus cleanses us from *all* sin.
