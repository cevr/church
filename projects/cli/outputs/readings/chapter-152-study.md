Study Title: The Peril of Pride and the Safety of Humility

Question: What is the inevitable result for anyone who cherishes pride?

Biblical Answer: “A man's pride shall bring him low.” (Proverbs 29:23)

Explanation: There is a spiritual law of gravity: those who exalt themselves will eventually fall. Pride blinds a person to their own faults and needs, leading to poor decisions and eventual ruin. True honor is found only in humility.

[ILL] Imagine a man walking with his nose high in the air to appear superior to others. Because he is looking up at himself rather than watching the path, he is the most likely to trip and fall.

Question: How does the Lord regard those who are proud?

Biblical Answer: “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.” (James 4:6); “The proud He knoweth afar off.” (Psalm 138:6)

Explanation: This is a solemn warning. God does not merely ignore pride; He actively "resists" it. The phrase "knoweth afar off" suggests that while God knows all things, He cannot have a close, intimate relationship with a proud heart. Pride builds a wall between the soul and the Savior.

[DYK] The word "resist" in James 4 is a military term (antitasso), meaning to range in battle against. When we stand in pride, we are actually placing ourselves in opposition to the Almighty.

Question: Does pride indicate wisdom or strength of character?

Biblical Answer: “He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words.” (1 Timothy 6:4); “A high look and a proud heart... is sin.” (Proverbs 21:4)

Explanation: The Apostle Paul equates pride with ignorance ("knowing nothing"). A proud person feels they have nothing left to learn, which makes them unteachable. In God's eyes, this is not strength; it is a sin that leads to unnecessary conflict and strife.

Term Definition: “Doting” in this context (1 Tim 6:4) implies a morbid or sickly craving for controversy and arguments, rather than a desire for truth.

Question: What is the condition of society regarding pride in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “Men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud.” (2 Timothy 3:2); “The child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient.” (Isaiah 3:5)

Explanation: One of the signs of the end of time is a culture of narcissism and self-worship. We see this today where self-promotion is encouraged, and respect for elders and authority ("the ancient") is diminishing.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This description of the "last days" parallels the condition of the church of Laodicea in Revelation 3:17. Laodicea says, "I am rich... and have need of nothing." This spiritual pride is the most dangerous of all, as it prevents the believer from seeing their need for Christ's robe of righteousness.

Question: Though the world may call the proud "happy" (Malachi 3:15), what will be their final fate?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud... shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up.” (Malachi 4:1)

Explanation: In the final judgment, pride—the very sin that originated with Lucifer—will be completely consumed. "Stubble" refers to the dry stalks left after harvest; it is highly flammable and burns away quickly, leaving nothing behind.

[ILL] Just as chaff cannot withstand the fire of the harvest, pride cannot exist in the presence of a Holy God. Humility is the only fireproof material, for it hides itself in Christ.

Deeper Insight: Pride was the original sin (Ezekiel 28:17). It turns the creature away from the Creator. Therefore, the removal of pride is essential for the restoration of peace in the universe.

Practical Application: How can we combat pride today? • By acknowledging that every talent we have is a gift from God • By serving others rather than seeking to be served • By asking God to give us the humble mind of Christ (Philippians 2:5).
