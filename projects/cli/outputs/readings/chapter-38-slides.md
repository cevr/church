Study Title: God Speaks: The Gift of Prophecy in the Church

---

Slide 1 Question: How did God’s method of communicating with humanity change after the entrance of sin?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, looking back with longing as they walk toward a shadowed land, soft light fading behind them.

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?” (Gen. 3:9).

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer (Continued): Since the fall: “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.” (Heb. 1:1).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elderly prophet standing on a rocky outcrop, looking toward the heavens, wind blowing his robes, receiving a divine message.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: In Eden, communication was direct and face-to-face. After the fall, sin separated humanity from God’s physical presence. However, God did not abandon His people.

---

Slide 5 Explanation (Continued): Instead, He established a system of communication through chosen messengers known as prophets.

[DYK] The phrase "sundry times and divers manners" suggests that God uses various methods to reach us—sometimes through visions, sometimes dreams, and sometimes oral messages—adapting His communication so we can understand it.

Slide 6 Question: What is the source of a true prophet's message?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe sitting at a wooden table, pausing with a quill in hand, looking upward for inspiration.

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove descending in a beam of light, touching the shoulder of a writing prophet, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: Prophecy is not the product of human genius, political insight, or vivid imagination. It is a "spiritual gift" initiated entirely by the Holy Spirit. The prophet is the vessel; the Spirit is the source.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an empty clay jar being filled with golden oil from a divine source, representing the vessel being filled.

---

Slide 9 Illustration: The Writer and the Pen

[ILL] Think of a writer using a pen. The pen (the prophet) puts the ink on the paper, but the thoughts, words, and direction come entirely from the Writer (the Holy Spirit).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on a hand holding a quill pen against parchment, the hand glowing slightly with a supernatural aura.

---

Slide 10 Question: How can we test whether a prophet is truly sent by God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of elders holding scrolls, examining them closely with serious expressions, testing the words written within.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer (Test 1): **Fulfillment of predictions:** “When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken...” (Deut. 18:22).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a city wall falling down exactly as predicted, with a prophet watching sorrowfully in the foreground.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer (Test 2): **Fidelity to God:** “If there arise among you a prophet... and giveth thee a sign... saying Let us go after other gods... thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet.” (Deut. 13:1-3).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a faithful prophet turning away from a golden idol, pointing a crowd toward the true light of heaven.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: A true prophet must meet strict criteria. First, their predictions must happen. Second, and most importantly, their teaching must lead people to obedience to the true God.

---

Slide 14 Definition: Presumptuously

**"Presumptuously"** refers to speaking with arrogance or taking authority that God has not granted. A false prophet speaks their own mind while claiming it is God's.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting contrasting a humble prophet bowing low versus an arrogant figure standing on a pedestal shouting.

---

Slide 15 Question: What represents the purpose of spiritual gifts, such as prophecy, in the church?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the early church believers gathering in a stone room, breaking bread and listening to a speaker.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith...” (Eph. 4:12-13).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of masons working together to build a beautiful stone temple, symbolizing the edifying of the church.

---

Slide 17 Breakdown of Purpose:
1.  **Perfecting** (maturing) the saints
2.  **Equipping** for ministry
3.  **Edifying** (building up) the church
4.  **Establishing** unity

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a teacher instructing younger disciples, handing them scrolls and tools, soft warm candlelight.

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: Paul lists apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers together to bring the church to a "perfect man" (maturity). Since the church has not yet reached total perfection, the gift of prophecy is still necessary.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the story of Agabus in Acts 21:10-11. He was a New Testament prophet who warned Paul. This shows prophecy functioned in the early church for practical guidance, separate from the writing of Scripture.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Agabus taking Paul’s belt and binding his own hands and feet, surrounded by concerned onlookers.

---

Slide 19 Question: How does the Bible describe the church of the last days regarding these gifts?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic sky with dark clouds and a piercing ray of light, symbolizing the end times.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 12:17).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a woman clothed with the sun standing firm against a dark, serpentine shadow (the dragon).

---

Slide 21 Biblical Definition: “The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” (Rev. 19:10).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle John on Patmos falling at the feet of a glowing angel, who points upward to heaven.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: The "remnant"—the final group of believers—is identified by two marks: keeping God's Commandments and possessing the Spirit of Prophecy.

[DYK] The prophecy of Joel 2:28 promises that in the "last days" God will pour out His Spirit, resulting in sons and daughters prophesying, old men dreaming dreams, and young men seeing visions.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse multi-generational group of people looking upward, their faces illuminated by a spiritual glow.

---

Slide 23 Practical Application: How should we relate to the gift of prophecy today?
• **Desire it:** "Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy" (1 Cor 14:1).
• **Respect it:** "Despise not prophesyings" (1 Thess 5:20).

---

Slide 24 Practical Application (Continued):
• **Use it:** We should study the messages God has sent to guide, warn, and comfort His people in these final days.
