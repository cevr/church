Study Title: The Shepherd and the Hireling: Discerning Spiritual Leadership

---

Slide 1 Question: Who is the ultimate standard of a true shepherd?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “I am the good Shepherd... The good Shepherd giveth His life for the sheep.” (John 10:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding a lamb in his arms, surrounded by a flock, gentle and protective expression, soft lighting.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Christ sets the standard for all spiritual leadership: self-sacrificing love.

While a "hireling" works merely for pay and flees danger, the True Shepherd places the life of the flock above His own.

[ILL] In a crisis, a mercenary runs to save himself; a parent runs to save their child. Jesus shepherds us with the heart of a Father, not an employee.

Slide 4 Question: What is the primary duty of a faithful spiritual leader?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Take heed... to all the flock... to feed the church of God.” (Acts 20:28)

“Preach the word.” (2 Timothy 4:2)

Slide 6 Explanation: The primary task is not to entertain or organize, but to *feed*.

The mandated diet for the church is the Word of God. Just as physical sheep cannot survive without grazing, spiritual sheep starve without Scripture.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, a shepherd didn't just watch sheep; he had to lead them to green pastures. If the shepherd was lazy, the sheep starved. Spiritual starvation occurs when leaders replace the Bible with philosophy.

Slide 7 Question: What role does the shepherd play regarding danger and warning?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel... warn them from Me.” (Ezekiel 33:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a watchman on a high wall blowing a shofar (ram's horn) with urgency.

---

Slide 9 Term Definition: **Watchman**

A sentry posted on a city wall to spot approaching enemies. If the watchman fell asleep or feared blowing the trumpet, the city would be destroyed, and the watchman held responsible.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: A true shepherd warns the flock of spiritual dangers and sin.

A false shepherd is described in Isaiah 56:10 as a "dumb dog that cannot bark," staying silent to avoid conflict.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight**: Jeremiah notes that false shepherds say "Peace, peace; when there is no peace" (Jeremiah 6:14). A faithful watchman warns of judgment and calls for preparation, whereas a worldly shepherd comforts people in their sins to maintain popularity.

Slide 11 Question: How can we distinguish between a true and a false teacher?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two large scrolls, representing the Law and the Prophets, resting on a wooden table.

---

Slide 13 Progressive Disclosure:

1.  **The Standard**: The "Law" (God's instructions) and the "Testimony" (The prophetic witness).
2.  **The Test**: Do their words align with this written standard?
3.  **The Verdict**: If there is a contradiction, there is "no light" (no truth) in them.

[ILL] A bank teller recognizes counterfeit money not by studying every fake, but by studying the genuine bill so thoroughly that any deviation is obvious. We detect false shepherds by knowing the "genuine" article—the Law and the Testimony.

Slide 14 Question: How do false shepherds handle unpopular truths or prophecies?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd covering their ears or looking angry at a speaker.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy unto us deceits.” (Isaiah 30:10)

“They will not endure sound doctrine... and they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” (2 Timothy 4:3-4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a false teacher wearing fine robes, smiling and gesturing to a pleased, relaxed crowd.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Human nature prefers "smooth things"—flattery and easy assurances—over the conviction of the Holy Spirit.

False shepherds cater to "itching ears" by avoiding the hard truths of prophecy or the call to repentance.

[SN] **Historical Connection**: Early Adventists saw a parallel here regarding the prophecies of Daniel. While learned leaders declared the prophecies "sealed," humble students of the Word found them unsealed by the "Lion of the tribe of Judah," revealing the investigative judgment and Second Coming.

Slide 17 Question: What is God’s promise when human shepherds fail the flock?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of sheep scattered in a rocky landscape under a stormy, dark sky.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Behold, I, even I, will both search My sheep, and seek them out... and will deliver them out of all places where they had been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.” (Ezekiel 34:11-12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bright, divine light breaking through dark clouds, illuminating a path for scattered sheep.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Even if every human leader fails, God does not abandon His people.

He promises to personally intervene, gather the scattered, and feed them with justice and truth.

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: The Gathering

This points to the work of the Gospel in the last days. Despite the "cloudy and dark day" of confusion in the religious world, the Voice of Jesus will be heard through Scripture, calling His people out of confusion and into His fold.

Slide 21 Practical Application

*   **For the Leader**: Are we feeding those in our care with the pure Word, or our own opinions?
*   **For the Believer**: Do we evaluate every sermon by the "Law and the Testimony"?
*   **The Assurance**: We can trust the Chief Shepherd (1 Peter 5:4) to guide us safely home.
