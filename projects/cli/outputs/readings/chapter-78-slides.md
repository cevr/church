Study Title: The Two Laws: What Was Abolished?

Slide 1 Question: Did Jesus come to destroy the Law of God?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:17-18)

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus explicitly stated He did not come to dismantle the moral law. To "fulfill" means to fill with meaning, obedience, and realization. As long as heaven and earth remain, God’s moral standard remains.

[ILL] Imagine a teacher who perfectly demonstrates how to solve a complex math equation. By solving it, they haven't "abolished" the rules of mathematics; they have "fulfilled" or established them. Jesus magnified the law by showing us how to live it perfectly.

Slide 4 Question: If the Moral Law remains, what explicitly *did* Jesus abolish at the cross?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.” (Ephesians 2:15)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Paul refers here to a specific type of law—the "law of commandments contained in ordinances." This is the ceremonial system (sacrifices, feast days, circumcision). These rituals were shadows pointing forward to Christ. Once Christ came, the shadows were no longer needed.

[DYK] The "middle wall of partition" (Eph 2:14) alludes to a physical barrier in the Jewish Temple separating the Court of the Gentiles from inner courts. Christ spiritually demolished this barrier, uniting Jew and Gentile.

Slide 7 Question: How do we know the "abolished" law was not the Ten Commandments?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” (Romans 7:12)
“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not grievous.” (1 John 5:3)

---

Slide 9 Explanation: The Moral Law is described as holy, just, and good. The abolished law was called "enmity" (hostility). Something "holy and good" cannot be "enmity." Therefore, the abolished law was the system of exclusive ceremonies, not the Ten Commandments which define love.

Slide 10 Comparison: The Two Laws & The Cross

*   **Moral Law:** Reveals sin, is eternal, written on stone.
*   **Ceremonial Law:** Prescribed remedies (sacrifices), was temporary, written in a book.
*   **The Cross:** Ratified the Moral Law (sin has a cost) and terminated the Ceremonial Law (the ultimate Sacrifice was made).

[SN] The logic of Sin: "Sin is the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). If the Ten Commandments were abolished, sin no longer exists, and we need no Savior. The fact that we need a Savior proves the Law identifying sin is still in effect.

Slide 11 Question: With ceremonial rites like circumcision gone, what remains of the utmost importance?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.” (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Slide 13 Insight: Defining "The Law"
Scripture uses the term "Law" in different ways based on context:
1.  **The Decalogue:** The Ten Commandments.
2.  **The Ceremonial Law:** The system of types and shadows.
3.  **The Pentateuch:** The first five books of Moses.
*Context determines the meaning.*

Slide 14 Deeper Insight: The Ark of the Covenant
The ceremonial law was placed in the **side** of the ark (Deut 31:26) as a witness. The Ten Commandments were placed **inside** the Ark, under the Mercy Seat (Exod 25:16). One was a manual; the other, the eternal foundation of God's throne.

Slide 15 Practical Application: Why does this distinction matter?
*   It protects us from **legalism** (earning salvation through rituals).
*   It protects us from **lawlessness** (thinking we are free to sin).
*   We are saved by grace alone, but we are saved *to* a life of obedience.
