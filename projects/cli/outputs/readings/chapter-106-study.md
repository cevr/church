Study Title: The Fate of the Transgressor: God’s Final Justice

Question: What does the Bible say is the ultimate penalty for sin?

Biblical Answer: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

Explanation: The Bible presents a stark contrast. The reward for righteousness is life, while the wages—the payment earned—for sin is death. This is not an eternal life in misery, but a cessation of life.

Term Definition: “Die” and “Perish” (Webster’s): To cease to live; to expire; to be blotted from existence. When Scripture says the wicked "perish" (Luke 13:3), it signifies coming to nothing.

[ILL] If an employee works for wages, the payment is the end result of their labor. Similarly, sin produces a specific result: death. Just as life is a gift we do not naturally possess, eternal death is the removal of that gift.

Question: How complete is this destruction? Will the wicked continue to exist in some form?

Biblical Answer: “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven... and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.” (Malachi 4:1)

Explanation: The destruction is total. The imagery of "stubble" in an oven suggests a fire that consumes completely until nothing is left. Obadiah 1:16 adds that they shall be “as though they had not been.”

[DYK] The Psalmist compares the end of the wicked to the "fat of lambs" consuming into smoke (Psalm 37:20). In the ancient sacrificial system, the fat was completely burned away on the altar, leaving nothing behind but smoke and ash.

Question: Where will this punishment take place, and does it happen immediately at death?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.” (2 Peter 2:9)

Explanation: The wicked are not currently being punished. They are "reserved"—kept in waiting—until the final Day of Judgment. Furthermore, Revelation 20:9 indicates this fire comes down from God "on the breadth of the earth."

Deeper Insight: The earth itself, currently marred by sin, is the "place" of the wicked. Scripture says, “the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner” (Proverbs 11:31). God does not have a separate, eternal torture chamber; He purifies the very earth where sin was committed.

[SN] The "Root and Branch" imagery in Malachi is often viewed by Adventist pioneers as representing Satan (the root) and his followers (the branches). This signifies the end of the entire mystery of iniquity. Sin is not perpetuated in an eternal hell; it is eradicated so the universe can be clean again.

Question: What happens to the earth after this purifying fire?

Biblical Answer: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13)

Explanation: The fire that consumes the wicked also purifies the earth, melting the elements with fervent heat (2 Peter 3:12). From these ashes, God creates a New Earth, fulfilling the promise that the meek shall inherit the earth (Matthew 5:5).

[ILL] Imagine a forest fire that clears away deadwood and debris, allowing for new, lush growth to spring forth. God’s fire is not a fire of cruelty, but of cleansing, preparing the world for a fresh start free from the presence of sin.

Question: What will be the condition of the universe when sin is gone?

Biblical Answer: “And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth... heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.” (Revelation 5:13)

Progressive Disclosure: • Sin is gone • The wicked are no more • The earth is renewed • Universal praise is restored

Practical Application: This doctrine reveals God’s character as both just and merciful. He does not delight in the death of the wicked, nor does He torture enemies eternally for a temporal life of sin. He removes sin to secure the happiness of the universe. Our choice today is simply: Life or Death? God invites us to choose Life.
