Slide 1 Question: What is the "Gospel" and what power does it hold?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.” (Romans 1:16)

Slide 3 Explanation: The word "Gospel" translates to "Good News." This is not merely information; it is active power. It is the specific announcement that a Savior has come to rescue humanity from the condition of sin.

[DYK] The name "Jesus" (Yeshua) literally means "Jehovah is Salvation." The very name of the Messiah announces His mission: "He shall save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).

Slide 4 Question: Was this "Good News" available to people in the Old Testament, before Jesus was born?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham.” (Galatians 3:8)

Slide 6 Key Insights:
*   The Gospel is eternal.
*   Abraham was justified by faith.
*   Old Testament sacrifices pointed toward Christ.

Slide 7 Explanation: The Gospel was not a new invention in the New Testament. Believers in the Old Testament (the "old dispensation") were saved by faith in the Savior, just as we are. We look backward to the Cross; they looked forward to it through the "shadow" of the ceremonial service (Hebrews 10:1).

[ILL] Think of a shadow cast by a person walking around a corner. You see the shadow before you see the person, but the shadow proves the person is coming. The Old Testament ceremonies were the shadow; Jesus is the reality.

Slide 8 Question: How did people know they needed a Savior in the first place?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” (Romans 3:20)

---

Slide 10 Explanation: You cannot appreciate a cure until you realize you have a disease. The Law of God acts as a mirror; it reveals our moral defects and defines what sin is. Without the Law to define sin, there is no need for the Gospel to save us from it.

Slide 11 Term Definition: **Dispensation**
A period of time in which God administers His relationship with humanity.
*   **Old Dispensation:** Before the Cross (Looking forward).
*   **Christian Dispensation:** After the Cross (Looking backward).

Slide 12 Question: Did Jesus come to abolish or destroy the Law so we wouldn't have to worry about it?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching in the temple courts, surrounded by listeners and scribes.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding a Torah scroll, looking at it with deep respect and love.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: "Fulfill" here means to fill up or carry out its design. The Law was ordained to bring life (Romans 7:10), but our sin brought condemnation. Jesus lived out the perfect righteousness of the Law and paid the penalty for our breaking of it.

[SN] **The Logic of the Cross:** If the Law could have been changed or abolished, Jesus would not have needed to die. The fact that Christ had to pay the penalty proves that the Law is immutable (unchangeable). He died to satisfy the claims of the Law so that the sinner could be saved.

Slide 15 Question: Does having faith in Jesus mean we make the Law void (empty or useless)?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of early Christians discussing scriptures together in a home.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” (Romans 3:31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a firm foundation stone being laid, symbolizing stability and establishment.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: Faith and Law are friends, not enemies. The Law guides us to Christ by showing us our sin. Christ then forgives us and writes that same Law in our hearts, empowering us to obey it through love.

Slide 18 Question: How does the Bible describe the final group of saved people at the end of time?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast multitude of people in white robes standing before a throne, bathed in golden light.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer looking upward with a calm, steadfast expression amidst a chaotic background.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: In the closing scenes of history, God’s people are identified by two distinct markers:
1.  They possess the **faith of Jesus** (trusting wholly in His merits).
2.  They **keep the commandments of God** (the fruit of that faith).

[ILL] A passport requires two stamps to be valid for entry in some analogies: The blood of Christ (The Gospel) clears our past, and the obedience of faith (The Law) marks our present walk. We are saved *by* grace, *for* a life of obedience.

---

Slide 21 Practical Application:
1.  **Mirror Check:** Use the Law to examine your heart and see your need.
2.  **Look to the Lamb:** When condemned, look immediately to Jesus.
3.  **Walk in Harmony:** Allow the Spirit to help you obey out of love.
