Study Title: Integrity in Debts and Business

---

Slide 1 Question: Does God care about how promptly we pay those who work for us?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt not oppress a hired servant that is poor and needy... at his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it... lest he cry against thee unto the Lord, and it be sin unto thee.” (Deuteronomy 24:14, 15)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God takes a personal interest in business transactions, specifically the protection of the vulnerable. The instruction is clear: debts to workers should be settled immediately.

Delaying payment is not merely poor management; Scripture defines it as oppression and sin.

Slide 4 Did You Know?

[DYK] In biblical times, many laborers were paid daily. Withholding wages even for a single night meant the worker’s family might go without food that evening. God’s law ensures the protection of the dependent.

Slide 5 Question: How does God react when wages are withheld by fraud?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Behold, the hire of the laborers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth; and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth.” (James 5:4)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The withholding of what is owed acts as a testimony against the debtor. God hears the "cry" of the unpaid bill and the defrauded worker. James warns that this is a specific sin of the "last days."

Slide 8 Speaker Note: Lord of Sabaoth

[SN] The title “Lord of Sabaoth” means “Lord of Hosts” or “Lord of Armies.” It implies that the God who commands the armies of heaven is the defender of the unpaid laborer. It is a sober warning to those who think their financial power puts them above the law.

Slide 9 Question: With what class of sinners does God group those who defraud workers?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages...” (Malachi 3:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Malachi speaking fervently to a crowd, holding a scroll, dramatic warm lighting.

Slide 11 Progressive Disclosure: The List of Offenses

• Sorcerers
• Adulterers
• False Swearers (Liars)
• **Oppressors of workers**

---

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: We often categorize sins by severity, thinking financial negligence is less serious than sorcery or adultery.

However, God places financial dishonesty in the same category because it reveals a heart void of love and justice. Honesty in business is a test of character for the Kingdom.

---

Slide 13 Question: Does the Bible hold us responsible for accidents, negligence, or borrowed items?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two men conversing over a broken wooden plow or tool, expressing concern.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “If a man borrow aught of his neighbor, and it be hurt, or die... he shall surely make it good.” (Exodus 22:14)

“If fire break out... he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.” (Exodus 22:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fire spreading in the corner of a field, with men rushing to contain it, historically respectful.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The Bible teaches the principle of *restitution*. It is not enough to simply apologize; one must "make it good."

If our negligence causes loss to another—whether by fire, livestock, or a borrowed item breaking—justice requires us to restore the loss.

---

Slide 16 Illustration

[ILL] Imagine borrowing a tool from a neighbor and breaking it. A worldly approach says, "It was an accident." A biblical approach says, "I must replace this, so my neighbor suffers no loss because of my action."

Slide 17 Term Definition: Usury

**Usury** (Deuteronomy 23:19) refers to charging interest, specifically excessive interest, to a brother or a poor person. The Bible encourages lending to help the needy, not to profit from their distress.

Slide 18 Question: What is the only "debt" that a Christian should never fully pay off?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people in an ancient village helping one another, sharing burdens, soft golden hour light.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Render therefore to all their dues... Owe no man anything, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.” (Romans 13:7, 8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul writing an epistle on parchment, surrounded by other believers.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: We are to pay our monetary debts ("render dues") so that we owe nothing in the ledger.

However, we have a perpetual obligation to love others. This is a debt we pay every day but never finish paying.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Good Samaritan tending to the wounds of the injured man, symbolizing perpetual love.

---

Slide 21 Speaker Note: Spirit-Led Tangent

[SN] The concept of "Owe no man anything" was taken very seriously by early Advent believers. They viewed freedom from debt as essential to being free to support the spreading of the Gospel and to be ready for Christ's return without earthly entanglements.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of 19th-century believers kneeling in prayer in a simple room, historically respectful, soft light.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application

• Pay bills and employees on time, without delay.
• If we damage someone's property, offer restitution immediately.
• Avoid taking on debts that we cannot surely repay.
• Treat every business interaction as a witness of our faith.

Slide 23 Conclusion

God calls us to be light in the darkness; a Christian who is honest, prompt, and generous in business glorifies the Creator.
