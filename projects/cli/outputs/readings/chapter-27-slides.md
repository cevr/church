---

Slide 1 Question: How long ago did God determine a plan to save humanity?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: "According as He hath chosen us in Him [Christ] before the foundation of the world." (Ephesians 1:4)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Before the earth was formed or sin entered, God had already secured a way for humanity to be saved. This "election" is primarily focused on Christ.

---

Slide 4 Explanation (Continued): Christ is the Chosen One. When we are "in Him," we share in that election.

[DYK] The phrase "foundation of the world" (Greek *katabole*) implies the very conception or casting down of the structure of the universe. God’s love for you predates history itself.

Slide 5 Question: Is this salvation automatic, or is there an action required on our part?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man standing at a crossroads, looking contemplative as he decides which path to take.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: "Wherefore... brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure." (2 Peter 1:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe working diligently at a desk, focused intently on the scroll before him.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: While God provides the invitation (the calling), we must provide the diligence. Salvation is a cooperative relationship.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two hands reaching toward each other—one divine and glowing, the other human and reaching up.

---

Slide 8 Explanation (Continued): God gives the grace, but we must actively choose to accept and walk in it.

[ILL] Imagine a ship that is "elected" or scheduled to cross the ocean safely to a specific destination. The ship's destiny is fixed. However, for you to reach that destination, you must choose to board the ship and remain on board during the journey.

---

Slide 9 Question: Does God arbitrarily choose some for salvation and others for destruction?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large crowd of diverse people, soft light illuminating their faces equally.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: "Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth." (1 Timothy 2:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing on a mount, arms wide open, addressing a multitude of people extending to the horizon.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: It is God's will that *all* be saved. He does not predestine any individual to be lost. His "predestination" is the pre-determined plan that anyone who accepts Christ will be adopted as a son or daughter.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father embracing a returning son, symbolizing adoption and acceptance.

---

Slide 12 Question: How then do we understand the scripture that says God "hardens" whom He will?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pharaoh or king with a stern, unyielding expression, sitting on a stone throne.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: "With the merciful Thou wilt shew Thyself merciful; with an upright man Thou wilt shew Thyself upright... and with the froward [perverse] Thou wilt shew Thyself froward." (Psalm 18:25, 26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beam of light striking a mirror and reflecting brightly, compared to striking a dark rock and being absorbed.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: God acts toward men according to their own choices. The same sun that softens wax also hardens clay. The difference is not in the sun, but in the nature of the material.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter’s workshop, showing soft clay on a wheel and hardened pottery drying in the sun.

---

Slide 15 Explanation (Continued): When God's love shines on a rebellious heart that refuses to yield, that heart becomes harder—not because God wants it to, but because the individual resists Him.

Term Definition: "Froward" comes from the Old English "from-ward," meaning turning away or perverse. It describes someone who stubbornly resists guidance.

Slide 16 Question: What is the essential condition for receiving salvation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple, ancient door standing slightly ajar, inviting someone to enter.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." (Acts 16:31). "Choose you this day whom ye will serve." (Joshua 24:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Joshua addressing the elders of Israel under a great oak tree, holding a staff.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: Belief is not merely an intellectual nod; in Scripture, it implies trust and loyalty. God respects human free will so deeply that He requires us to "choose" and "will" to serve Him.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The concept of "whosoever will" (Revelation 22:17) is the closing invitation of the Bible. It stands in contrast to the idea of limited atonement. The Pioneers of the Advent movement strongly emphasized that the atonement was provided for all, though applied only to those who believe.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in sincere prayer, face upturned with an expression of deep trust.

---

Slide 19 Question: Is it possible to have your name written in heaven and then removed?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large, open book resting on a divine podium, filled with handwritten names.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: "He that overcometh,... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life." (Revelation 3:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a hand holding a quill, pausing over an open page of a great book, historically respectful.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Having one's name written in heaven is a cause for rejoicing, but it is conditional on perseverance. We are told to "hold fast" and "endure unto the end."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a traveler in a storm, holding tightly to their cloak and staff, pressing forward against the wind.

---

Slide 22 Deeper Insight: This touches on the concept of the Investigative Judgment. A name can be entered into the book when a person turns to God, but the final sealing of that name depends on a life of faithful overcoming through the power of Christ.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a solemn courtroom scene, with an advocate standing beside a believer before a judge.

---

Slide 23 Illustration: A runner who signs up for a marathon is "registered" (written in the book). But to receive the medal (the crown), they must not only start the race but finish it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient Greek runner straining toward the finish line, eyes fixed on a laurel wreath.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: Since God has done His part by choosing us, our focus today should be on our part:
1.  **Choose**: Make a daily decision to serve God.
2.  **Endure**: Don't let go when life gets hard.
3.  **Trust**: Know that if you love God, He is working for your good.
