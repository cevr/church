Slide 3 Biblical Answer (The Conclusion): “Behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 2:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Solomon standing alone on a balcony at twilight, looking away from the party inside, his expression weary and empty.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Solomon possessed the wealth and power to deny himself nothing. He treated pleasure as an experiment. His conclusion was that a life devoted merely to "mirth" leaves the soul empty and "vexed."

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, kings often maintained vast courts designed for constant entertainment. Solomon had access to the best musicians, gardens, and luxuries of his day, yet he found them hollow without God.

Slide 8 Explanation: Constant amusement distracts us from reality. Moments of seriousness force us to reflect on our mortality and our standing before God, which improves our character.

[ILL] A diet consisting only of candy tastes good for a moment but leaves the body weak. Similarly, a life fed only on entertainment leaves the spiritual character weak. Sobriety is the solid food that builds spiritual muscle.

Slide 15 Explanation: We are in a spiritual conflict. A soldier on the battlefield cannot afford to be distracted by entertainment. The adversary looks for those who are spiritually asleep.

[SN] Early Adventist pioneers viewed the believer as a watchman on the walls of Zion. Just as the priests in the Sanctuary had to keep the lamps burning through the night, the believer must maintain a sober watchfulness.

Slide 20 Deeper Insight & Illustration: The proximity of the end changes our priorities.

[ILL] If you knew a thief was planning to break into your house tonight, you would not spend the evening distracted by games. You would be awake, watching the door. Because the end is near, we "gird up the loins of our mind."
