---

Slide 1 Question: What promise is made to those who are waiting for Jesus?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation.” (Hebrews 9:28)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The first time Christ came, He arrived as the "Lamb of God" to deal with humanity's guilt. This text promises He will appear a "second time," not to deal with sin again, but to bring final rescue to those eagerly anticipating His return.

[DYK] The concept of the "Second Coming" is one of the most frequently mentioned subjects in Scripture. It is mentioned over 300 times in the New Testament alone—statistically, one out of every 25 verses refers to it.

Slide 4 Question: Will Christ’s return be a secret or invisible event?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the disciples on the Mount of Olives gazing upward into the clouds as Jesus ascends, soft light filtering through the mist.

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “...This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two angels in white robes standing beside the disciples, pointing upward toward the heavens.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The angels at the ascension were specific: Jesus will return in "like manner" as He left. He left visibly, bodily, and in the clouds. Therefore, His return will be visible, physical, and in the clouds.

[ILL] If a loved one leaves on a plane and promises to return, you don't expect a "spirit" or a "ghost" to return; you expect the physical person to walk back through the arrival gate. The angels assured the disciples that the "same Jesus" would return.

Slide 7 Question: How many people will see Him when He returns?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him...” (Revelation 1:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the heavens rolling back like a scroll, revealing a brilliant, undeniable light visible to a multitude of people below.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: This event will not be limited to a select few or hidden in a secret chamber. It is a global event. "Every eye" implies universal visibility.

Term Definition: “Clouds” in the context of the Second Coming often refers to the glory of God or the hosts of angels accompanying Him (see Psalm 104:3, Matthew 25:31).

[SN] Scripture describes the event as the most public, audible, and visible event in human history. It is the "blessed hope" of the church, not a secret operation.

Slide 10 Question: What will we hear when Christ returns?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an archangel raising a silver trumpet to his lips, poised to blow a mighty blast, with a backdrop of stormy glory.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the heavens opening, Christ descending with power, sound waves visualized as ripples of light shaking the earth.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Far from being silent, the return of Christ is accompanied by three distinct sounds: a shout, the voice of the archangel, and the trumpet of God. This sound is powerful enough to wake the dead.

Slide 13 Question: Is death the same thing as the Second Coming of Christ?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus speaking intimately with Peter and John by the shore of the Sea of Galilee, soft morning light on the water.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he [John] tarry till I come, what is that to thee?... yet Jesus said not unto him, he shall not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?” (John 21:22-23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elderly Apostle John writing on a scroll, looking thoughtful, with a vision of the future return in his mind.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: In this passage, Jesus clearly distinguishes between a disciple dying and the event of His coming. Death is a sleep; the Coming is the awakening.

[DYK] Many people believe that a person receives their reward immediately upon death. However, Jesus taught that rewards are given when He returns.

---

Slide 16 Question: When exactly do believers receive their reward?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king sitting on a throne of judgment, holding a crown, ready to bestow it upon a faithful servant.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “For the Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels; and then He shall reward every man according to his works.” (Matthew 16:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ returning in the clouds, surrounded by angels bearing rewards and crowns.

Slide 18 Progressive Disclosure:
*   **The Event:** Christ coming in glory.
*   **The Timing:** "Then" (at that specific time).
*   **The Action:** Rewarding every man.

Explanation: The Bible consistently places the reward of the righteous at the resurrection of the just, which happens when Jesus returns.

Slide 19 Question: What happens to the believers who have died before He comes?

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “...The dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.” (1 Corinthians 15:52)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of tombs bursting open, figures rising with vibrant, youthful, glowing bodies, shedding old grave clothes.

---

Slide 21 Explanation & Insight: The righteous dead are not left behind. At the sound of the trumpet, they are raised to life with new, incorruptible bodies that can never die again.

Deeper Insight: Job said, "In my flesh shall I see God" (Job 19:26). He did not expect to see God as a disembodied spirit, but in a restored body at the "latter day."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Patriarch Job looking up from the dust with eyes full of faith and prophetic vision.

Slide 22 Question: What will Jesus look like when He returns?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the sun at high noon, blindingly bright, representing the brilliance of the coming King.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “...His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the light.” (Matthew 17:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Transfiguration, Jesus shining with intense white light, Moses and Elijah appearing beside Him in glory.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: When Jesus lived on earth as a man, He veiled His glory so humanity could approach Him. When He returns, He comes in the full glory of His Father. John describes His eyes as a "flame of fire" and His voice as "many waters."

[SN] The Transfiguration (Matt 17:2) was a miniature demonstration of His Second Coming kingdom, including Moses (resurrected saints) and Elijah (translated saints).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ coming in power, His robe glowing white, His countenance radiant, dispelling all darkness.

---

Slide 25 Practical Application:
Since the return of Christ is a literal, visible event that brings the final reward:
*   We live with "blessed hope," not fear.
*   We find comfort that our parted loved ones will be restored to us.
*   We prepare our hearts to meet a King, not just a concept.

Slide 26 Final Promise: “Then shall the King say... Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you...” (Matthew 25:34)
