Study Title: The Attributes of God: Knowing Whom We Worship

Question: When Jesus prayed to His Father before His trial, what specific attributes did He ascribe to God?

Biblical Answer: “Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me... O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee...” (John 17:11, 25)

Explanation: In His hour of crisis, Jesus focused on two pillars of God's character: Holiness (absolute purity and separation from sin) and Righteousness (perfect integrity and equity). Jesus entrusted His disciples not to a capricious deity, but to a Holy and Righteous Father.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the intimacy of the address "Father" combined with the reverence of "Holy" and "Righteous." This balance of awe and intimacy is the heart of true prayer.

Question: Does Jesus Christ possess these same attributes of holiness and righteousness?

Biblical Answer: “Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” (Acts 2:27)
“By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.” (Isaiah 53:11)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Holy One**: The apostles recognized Jesus as the fulfillment of David's prophecy—the Holy One who conquered death.
2.  **Righteous Servant**: Isaiah predicted a Messiah who is not only righteous Himself but has the power to make others righteous (justify them).

Term Definition: "Justify" means to be declared right or innocent in the sight of the law. Christ’s righteousness is credited to us.

Question: How did God describe His own character to Moses?

Biblical Answer: “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.” (Exodus 34:6)

Explanation: When God revealed His glory, He did not proclaim His power or size, but His character. His glory *is* His goodness.

[DYK] The word "Longsuffering" literally means "long of nose" (slow to anger/breathing deeply to restrain wrath). It implies that God is incredibly patient with our failures, giving us ample time to repent.

Question: How was this goodness and mercy demonstrated in the life of Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.” (Acts 10:38)

[ILL] Jesus was the "express image" of the Father. Just as a mirror reflects the face of the one looking into it, Jesus’ life of healing and compassion reflected the "merciful and gracious" character of the God declared in Exodus.

Question: Can we rely on God’s promises and justice?

Biblical Answer: “Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him... to a thousand generations.” (Deuteronomy 7:9)
“He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” (Deuteronomy 32:4)

Explanation: God is not only loving; He is stable. The term "Rock" suggests immovability. Because He is a God of truth and justice, the universe operates on moral laws that are as dependable as physical laws.

Deeper Insight: Truth is not just a concept; it is a Person. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). To know the Truth is to know Christ.

Question: Does God possess wisdom beyond our understanding?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.” (Job 36:5)

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Notice the pairing in Job—God is mighty, yet He "despiseth not any." Human power often leads to arrogance and looking down on the weak. Divine power is coupled with perfect wisdom and humility, caring for the lowly.

Question: Will God’s character ever change?

Biblical Answer: “They [the heavens and earth] shall perish, but thou shalt endure... thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.” (Psalm 102:26-27)

Explanation: Everything in creation is subject to decay and change. God alone is immutable (unchanging). The attributes we have studied—holiness, mercy, truth, justice—are permanent. He will never be less merciful or less just than He is today.

Question: Can we fully comprehend God?

Biblical Answer: “O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God: how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!” (Romans 11:33)

[ILL] A child may stand on the shore and touch the ocean, knowing it is wet and salty. They truly know the ocean, yet they cannot comprehend its vast depths or hidden trenches. Similarly, we can truly know God through His Word and Jesus Christ, even though His infinite nature remains beyond our full grasp.

Practical Application: Because God is...
*   **Holy**: We should approach Him with reverence.
*   **Merciful**: We can come to Him with our failures.
*   **Faithful**: We can trust His promises in uncertain times.
*   **Unchanging**: We have a solid Rock in a shifting world.
