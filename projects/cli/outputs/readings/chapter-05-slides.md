Study Title: Christ in All the Bible

---

Slide 1 Question: Whom does Jesus Himself say the Scriptures are really about?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.” (John 5:39)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus teaches that the Bible is not merely a history book or a collection of moral rules. It is a unified testimony about Himself. To understand the Old Testament properly, one must look for the Messiah on its pages.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The word "Search" in this text implies a diligent investigation, like digging for hidden treasure. The religious leaders of Christ's day memorized the text but missed the Person the text pointed to.

Slide 5 Question: How much of the Bible tells us about Jesus?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking on a dusty road with two disciples (the Road to Emmaus), gesturing as He explains something profound.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses holding stone tablets standing next to Isaiah holding a scroll, both looking toward a distant light.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Jesus revealed that "all the scriptures"—from the first books written by Moses through the prophets—contain truths concerning His mission. The Old Testament is the gospel in figure and prophecy; the New Testament is the gospel in fact and fulfillment.

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine a grand portrait covered by a curtain. The Old Testament prophecies are like lifting the corners of the curtain to reveal glimpses of the subject. When Jesus arrived, the curtain was fully pulled back to reveal the face that had been there all along.

Slide 9 Question: Where do we find the very first promise of a Saviour in the Bible?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Garden of Eden, lush but with long shadows cast by the setting sun, evoking a sense of loss and hope.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a serpent slithering away into darkness while a divine light shines on Adam and Eve.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: This verse, spoken in the Garden of Eden immediately after the fall of man, is often called the *Protoevangelium* (the first gospel). It promises a "Seed" (a Descendant) who would be wounded ("bruise his heel") but would ultimately crush the power of the serpent ("bruise thy head").

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: "Seed" here refers specifically to Jesus Christ. While Abraham had many descendants, the promise of salvation centered on one specific Lineage bearer, the Messiah (see Galatians 3:16).

Slide 13 Question: Was Christ present with the children of Israel during their wilderness journey?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the vast encampment of Israel in the desert with the Pillar of Cloud hovering protectively over them.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” (1 Corinthians 10:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of water gushing forcefully from a split rock in the desert, thirsty people gathering around to drink.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The Apostle Paul clarifies that the Provider and Protector of Israel in the Exodus was none other than Christ Himself. He was the "Angel" sent before them (Exodus 23:20) and the spiritual source of their life.

---

Slide 16 Speaker Note: Spirit-led tangent: This truth highlights the eternal pre-existence of Christ. He did not begin His existence at Bethlehem; His "goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting" (Micah 5:2). He has always been the active agent in the salvation of His people.

---

Slide 17 Question: How specific were the Old Testament prophecies regarding Christ’s life and betrayal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophet writing intently on parchment by candlelight, looking up as if hearing a voice.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer:
*   **Birthplace:** “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah... out of thee shall He come forth...” (Micah 5:2)
*   **Betrayal Price:** “So they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver.” (Zechariah 11:12)
*   **Dying Words:** “My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?” (Psalm 22:1)

---

Slide 19 Explanation: God provided specific identifying marks for the Messiah centuries before His arrival. From the exact town of His birth to the precise amount of silver paid for His betrayal, these prophecies serve as a fingerprint that only Jesus of Nazareth could match.

Slide 20 Question: How does the Old Testament describe the final kingdom of Christ?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel standing on a balcony in Babylon, looking up at a vision in the clouds.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “...behold, One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven... And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom... which shall not pass away...” (Daniel 7:13-14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Son of Man in royal robes surrounded by glorious clouds, approaching a blindingly bright throne.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: The story of Scripture does not end with the cross. The prophet Daniel was shown a vision of the judgment and the coronation of Christ. He receives an everlasting kingdom, assuring us that the plan of salvation concludes with the full restoration of God's authority.

---

Slide 23 Deeper Insight: This passage in Daniel depicts the "Son of Man" coming to the "Ancient of Days" in the heavenly courts. It describes the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, preparing to receive His kingdom before He returns to earth.

Slide 24 Practical Application: Why is it important to see Christ in all the Bible?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a modern believer sitting in a quiet room, reading a Bible with a look of peace and realization.

---

Slide 25 Application Points:
*   It builds confidence that God directs history.
*   It shows us that God has had a plan to save us from the very beginning (Genesis).
*   It assures us that the same Jesus who guided Israel through the wilderness guides us today.
*   It confirms that if the prophecies of His first coming were fulfilled exactly, the prophecies of His second coming are equally certain.
