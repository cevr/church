Study Title: The First Angel's Message: The Hour of Judgment

Question: Has God set a specific time for the judgment of the world?

Biblical Answer: “Because He hath appointed a day, in the which He will judge the world in righteousness.” (Acts 17:31)

Explanation: Judgment is not a random event; it is a scheduled appointment on God’s divine calendar. Just as God appointed a time for the first coming of Jesus (Galatians 4:4), He has appointed a time for the judgment work prior to the Second Coming.

[DYK] The concept of an "appointed day" would have resonated deeply with Paul’s audience in Athens (Acts 17). In legal systems, both ancient and modern, a trial cannot proceed without a set date. God is a God of order, not confusion.

Question: How is this judgment announced to the world?

Biblical Answer: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach... Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come.” (Revelation 14:6-7)

Explanation: This is known as the "First Angel's Message." It combines the "everlasting gospel" (the good news of salvation in Jesus) with the urgent announcement that the judgment is no longer a future event, but has arrived ("is come").

Term Definition: **"Angel"** (Greek: *aggelos*) literally means "messenger." While John saw a literal angel in vision, this symbol represents God's people proclaiming this urgent message to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue."

[ILL] Imagine a town crier or an emergency broadcast system. It interrupts normal programming to deliver news that affects everyone's immediate safety and future. The First Angel's message is God's "loud voice" alerting the world to the time we are living in.

Question: Revelation 14 announces the judgment. Which prophetic book unseals the timing of this event?

Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

Explanation: The prophet Daniel was told that his prophecies concerning the end times were "sealed" until the "time of the end."

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  Daniel is sealed until the end times.
2.  Revelation 10 depicts an angel with a "little book open" (Rev 10:2).
3.  This implies that the study of Daniel's time prophecies would be "opened" or understood just before the judgment message is proclaimed.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight:** In Revelation 10:5-6, the angel swears that "there should be time no longer." In historic Adventist understanding, this does not mean the end of literal time/history, but the end of **prophetic time**. The longest time prophecy in the Bible (the 2300 days of Daniel 8:14) marks the beginning of the judgment. Once that period ends, there are no more date-setting prophecies—only the waiting for the Second Coming.

Question: What was the specific time prophecy regarding the judgment and the sanctuary?

Biblical Answer: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

Explanation: The "cleansing of the sanctuary" is the event that corresponds to the judgment. In the earthly sanctuary service, the cleansing happened once a year on the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)—a day of judgment. Daniel 8:14 points to the time when Christ, our High Priest, begins this work in the heavenly sanctuary.

Question: How does Scripture describe the experience of the believers who first discovered this time message?

Biblical Answer: “And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.” (Revelation 10:10)

Explanation: "Eating" the book symbolizes receiving and internalizing the word of God (see Ezekiel 3:1).
*   **Sweet in the mouth:** The message that Jesus was coming to judge the world and take His people home (which early Adventists believed would happen in 1844 at the end of the 2300 days) was incredibly sweet and joyful.
*   **Bitter in the belly:** When the date passed and Jesus did not return, they experienced a "Great Disappointment."

[ILL] The disciples experienced a similar bitterness. They shouted "Hosanna!" thinking Jesus was about to take the throne of David in Jerusalem (sweet). Instead, He went to the cross (bitter). Yet, in that disappointment, God's greatest work (redemption) was actually being accomplished.

Deeper Insight: The error was not in the *time* calculation, but in the *event*. They thought "cleansing the sanctuary" meant the earth would be purified by fire at Jesus' return. Instead, it meant Christ was entering the final phase of His ministry in heaven—the investigative judgment—before He returns.

Question: Did this disappointment mean the work was finished?

Biblical Answer: “And He said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.” (Revelation 10:11)

Explanation: Far from being the end, the disappointment was a new beginning. God commissioned them to "prophesy again." They had to preach the message of the judgment (First Angel), the fall of spiritual Babylon (Second Angel), and the warning against the Mark of the Beast (Third Angel).

Practical Application:
*   **Certainty:** We live in the hour of God's judgment; our lives should reflect reverence and glory to Him.
*   **Resilience:** Like the disciples and the early Adventists, we may face disappointments or misunderstandings, but God calls us to study His Word deeper ("prophesy again") rather than give up.
*   **Hope:** The judgment is not something to fear for those in Christ; it is the process of vindicating God and preparing for the harvest of the earth.
