---

Slide 1 Question: In the days of Jesus, what was the Bible called?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?” (Matthew 21:42)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible refers to itself as the “Scriptures” (meaning *writings*) or the “Word of God” (Luke 8:21). These are not merely human literary works but are distinct and holy writings set apart for God’s people.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The word "Bible" does not actually occur in the text itself. It comes from the Greek word *biblia*, meaning "little books."

[DYK] This is derived from *byblos* (papyrus), the material used for ancient writing, named after the Phoenician port of Byblos from where the Greeks obtained it.

Slide 5 Question: How did we receive these writings? Did they originate from human ideas?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an apostle writing intently on parchment, with a subtle, divine glow illuminating the room, symbolizing the Holy Spirit.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The Bible is not a product of human will or invention. While humans held the pen, the Holy Spirit provided the thoughts. As Hebrews 1:1 states, it is God who spoke "by the prophets."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Old Testament prophets like Moses and Isaiah standing together, holding their writings, looking toward a heavenly light.

---

Slide 8 Term Definition: **Inspiration**

From 2 Timothy 3:16 ("All scripture is given by inspiration of God"), this literally means "God-breathed." God breathed His truth into the minds of chosen men.

Slide 9 Illustration: The Captain and the Helmsman

[ILL] Consider a captain steering a ship. The captain (the Holy Spirit) determines the course and the destination, but the helmsman (the human writer) physically turns the wheel. The personality of the writer is preserved, but the direction is entirely God's.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wooden ship at sea, a helmsman gripping the wheel, with a golden light breaking through the storm clouds above him.

Slide 10 Question: What specific benefits does the Bible offer the reader?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” (2 Timothy 3:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul dictating a letter to a scribe in a Roman setting.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The Scriptures are practical. They provide:
1. **Doctrine**: Teaching us what is true.
2. **Reproof**: Showing us where we are wrong.
3. **Correction**: Showing us how to get right.
4. **Instruction**: Teaching us how to stay right.

Slide 13 Deeper Insight: The Goal

The goal of this instruction is found in verse 17: “That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” God gives us the Bible to equip us completely for a life of service and holiness.

Slide 14 Question: How did Jesus view the authority of the Old Testament Scriptures?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking on the road to Emmaus, gesturing as He speaks to two disciples.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus’ hands holding an open scroll, with the onlookers’ faces reflecting awe and understanding.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Jesus accepted the authority of the writings available in His day (the Old Testament) and used them to prove His identity as the Messiah.

He divided them into three recognized sections: "the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms" (Luke 24:44).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of three distinct sets of scrolls—The Law, The Prophets, and The Writings—arranged reverently on a stone altar.

---

Slide 17 Speaker Note: Spirit-led Tangent

[SN] It is profound to note that the "Law of Moses" (the Pentateuch), "the Prophets" (including historical books like Kings), and "the Psalms" (the Writings) comprised the entire Hebrew canon. By citing them, Jesus validated the history, the prophecies, and the songs of Israel as a unified testimony pointing to Himself. If the Master trusted the Scriptures, His followers must do likewise.

Slide 18 Question: Can we trust the content of the Bible?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a massive stone pillar supporting a temple, symbolizing strength and reliability.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, looking upward with an expression of absolute trust.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: God is a "God of truth" (Deuteronomy 32:4). Because His character is perfect and He cannot lie, His Word is the standard of absolute truth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a balance scale perfectly even, with a scroll on one side and a glowing light on the other, symbolizing truth.

---

Slide 21 Did You Know? The Unity of the Bible

[DYK] The Bible contains sixty-six books written by thirty-five to forty different men over a period of fifteen hundred years. Despite this vast span of time and diversity of authors (kings, fishermen, shepherds, doctors), the Bible maintains a unified message of redemption, proving one Divine Author guided the process.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a collage of scenes—a king in a palace, a shepherd in a field, and a fisherman in a boat—all looking toward the same star or light source.

---

Slide 22 Question: How highly does God value His Word?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ark of the Covenant, glowing softly, representing the presence of God.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Thou has magnified Thy word above all Thy name.” (Psalm 138:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King David playing a harp and singing, looking up toward a break in the clouds.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: A person's "name" represents their reputation and character. God has placed His written Word as the highest representation of His character. It is the bond of His integrity. If His Word fails, His character fails.

"The word of our God shall stand for ever" (Isaiah 40:8).

---

Slide 25 Practical Application: How should we treat this Book?

*   **As a Lamp:** Use it to guide daily decisions (Psalm 119:105).
*   **As Food:** Esteem it more than "necessary food" (Job 23:12).
*   **As Hope:** Find patience and comfort in its pages (Romans 15:4).

Slide 26 Closing Thought

[SN] We often seek God through feelings or circumstances, but He has chosen to reveal Himself primarily through His Word. To hear God speak, we must open the Scriptures.
