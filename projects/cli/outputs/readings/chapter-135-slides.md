Slide 6 Reasons for Submission:

Slide 7 Did You Know?
The Greek word for "submit" (*hupotasso*) is a military term meaning "to arrange troop divisions in a military fashion under the command of a leader."

It implies an orderly arrangement for victory, not a humiliation of the soldier.

Slide 8 Question: What does true submission look like in our minds?

Slide 10 Explanation: Submission begins inwardly. It involves surrendering our pride ("high things") and aligning our thought patterns with the example of Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person placing a crown or valuable object at the foot of a cross, symbolizing the surrender of pride.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person being washed or purified with water, symbolizing spiritual cleansing and sanctification.

---

Slide 13 Breaking Down Sanctification:
*   Walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
*   Fulfilling the righteousness of the law (Romans 8:4).

**Definition**: Sanctification is the process of being made holy; a daily setting apart of oneself for God’s use.

Slide 14 Illustration: The Vine and the Trellis
Imagine a wild vine. Left to itself, it produces poor fruit in the mud. When a gardener ties it to a trellis (submission), it may feel confined, but it is finally positioned to receive sunlight and bear sweet fruit.

Slide 15 Question: Which part of the body requires the greatest exertion and grace to bring into submission?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of men in discussion, with one man listening intently, his hand over his mouth in a gesture of restraint.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “The tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.” (James 3:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a ship's rudder in the water or a horse's bridle, focusing on the small mechanism controlling a large force.

---

Slide 17 Insight: While we must present our whole bodies as a "living sacrifice" (Romans 12:1), the tongue is the true indicator of the heart's condition. To "bridle" the tongue requires the constant indwelling of the Holy Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove descending, soft light, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's control.

---

Slide 18 Speaker Note: A Living Sacrifice
In the Old Testament, the animal was slain. in the New Covenant, the believer is a *living* sacrifice.

The challenge of a living sacrifice is that it can choose to crawl off the altar. Submission is the act of staying on the altar daily.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stone altar with a fire burning brightly upon it, but no animal, symbolizing a spiritual sacrifice.

---

Slide 19 Question: How was submission perfectly exemplified in the life of Christ?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing calmly, looking forward with gentle resolve.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “He [Jesus] humbled Himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.” (Philippians 2:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus carrying the cross, focused and humble, amidst a crowd.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: Jesus did not submit because He was powerless, but because He trusted the Father’s plan.

His prayer in Gethsemane, "Thy will be done" (Matthew 6:10), is the ultimate model for the Christian.

Slide 22 Question: How does a Christian relate to worldly governments and authorities?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Roman governor or magistrate sitting in a judgment seat, historically respectful.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates.” (Titus 3:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll containing a decree or law, resting on a table.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Governments are ordained by God to maintain order (Romans 13:1). Christians should be exemplary citizens, respecting the laws of the land.

Slide 25 Question: Is there a limit to our submission to human authority?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a measuring reed or line, symbolizing a boundary or limit.

Slide 26 Biblical Answer: “We ought to obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter and the apostles standing firmly before the Sanhedrin, respectful but unyielding.

---

Slide 27 Historic Example: The Three Hebrews
In Daniel 3, the three Hebrews were submissive subjects in civil matters, but refused to bow to idols. They honored the King’s authority over their bodies (by accepting the fire) but reserved their worship for God alone.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego standing before the golden image, refusing to bow while others around them are prostrate.

---

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two people helping one another carry a burden on a path.

Slide 31 Question: What are the principles for submission in the home?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family inside a tent or home, appearing peaceful and united.

Slide 32 Biblical Answer:
*   **Wives:** “Submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.” (Colossians 3:18)
*   **Husbands:** “Love your wives, and be not bitter against them.” (Colossians 3:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a husband and wife holding hands or conversing respectfully, soft warm lighting.

---

Slide 33 Explanation: This submission is not slavish fear. It is "fit in the Lord." The husband is called to love as Christ loves the church—a self-sacrificing love that makes submission a joy rather than a burden.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ extending a hand to a group of people, symbolizing His love for the church.

---

Slide 34 Practical Application: Where can you practice submission today?
