Study Title: Perfection of Character: Growing in Grace

Question: What is the natural condition of humanity?

Biblical Answer: “For all men have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)

Explanation: The starting point of the gospel is the realization that humanity, by nature, falls short of God’s ideal. We are not merely undeveloped; we are separated from the "glory"—the character and presence—of God.

Question: How can a person’s nature be changed?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature; old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Explanation: This change is not a renovation, but a re-creation. When one is "in Christ," the old life of selfishness ceases to be the ruling power, and a new life, motivated by the Spirit, begins.

[ILL] Consider a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly. It does not merely improve its crawling technique; it undergoes a metamorphosis into a completely different creature with new abilities and a new nature.

Question: What distinguishes the "old life" from the "new life"?

Biblical Answer: “Now the works of the flesh are manifest... Adultery, fornication, uncleanness... hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife... But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Galatians 5:19-23)

Progressive Disclosure: Note the distinction in terms:
• **Works** of the flesh: Suggests labor, struggle, and the grinding effort of human nature.
• **Fruit** of the Spirit: Suggests a natural, organic byproduct of being connected to the Life-giver.

[DYK] The Greek word for "fruit" here is singular, not plural. While there are many attributes (love, joy, peace), they are all one cluster—the singular fruit of a life filled with the Holy Spirit. You cannot have true biblical peace without patience, nor biblical love without self-control.

Question: Is the concept of "perfection" or maturity taught in the Bible?

Biblical Answer: “But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting [lacking] nothing.” (James 1:4)

Term Definition: **"Perfect"** (Greek: *teleios*). In the New Testament, this often means "mature," "complete," or "reaching the goal." It does not always imply absolute freedom from mistakes in knowledge, but rather a heart that is undivided in its loyalty to God and fully mature in Christian love.

Question: How does a believer grow toward this maturity?

Biblical Answer: “And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue; and to virtue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, charity.” (2 Peter 1:5-7)

Explanation: This is often called "Peter's Ladder." Salvation is a free gift, but character building requires "all diligence." We cooperate with God by actively adding these graces to our lives through His strength.

[SN] Spirit-led Insight: Ellen White often wrote about the "ladder of Christian progress." Notice that the ladder begins with **Faith** (the root) and ends with **Charity** (Love—the fruit). This mirrors the path of Christ, who is the author and finisher of our faith.

Question: What role does the Bible play in this growth?

Biblical Answer: “As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby.” (1 Peter 2:2)

Question: How deeply should we internalize God’s Word?

Biblical Answer: “Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.” (Jeremiah 15:16)

Explanation: Reading the Bible is compared to eating. Just as food must be eaten and digested to become part of our blood and bone, Scripture must be meditated upon and applied until it shapes our very character.

Question: Alongside the Word, what is necessary for building character?

Biblical Answer: “But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost.” (Jude 20)

[ILL] Prayer and the Word are like the two lungs of the spiritual life. To breathe in, we receive God's voice through His Word; to breathe out, we respond to Him in prayer. If either stops, spiritual life suffocates.

Question: What is the ultimate goal Christ has for His people?

Biblical Answer: “That He might present it to Himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.” (Ephesians 5:27)

Deeper Insight: The "spot" represents a defilement from the outside (sin), while the "wrinkle" represents a sign of aging or decay. Christ intends to present a church that is both pure (spotless) and eternally youthful/vigorous (wrinkle-free) in spirit.

Question: Can we trust God to complete this work in us?

Biblical Answer: “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

[DYK] This verse affirms the holistic nature of humanity. We are not just floating spirits; our physical habits ("body"), our mental faculties ("soul"), and our spiritual connection ("spirit") are all to be sanctified and preserved by God's power.

Practical Application:
How can we cooperate with God in building character today?
• **Identify** the "old things" (habits/attitudes) that need to pass away.
• **Feed** on the Word daily, not just reading it, but "eating" it through meditation.
• **Pray** specifically for the "Fruit of the Spirit" where you are lacking (e.g., asking for patience or temperance).
• **Trust** that it is the "God of peace" who sanctifies you; your role is to surrender and follow.
