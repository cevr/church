Study Title: The Miracle of a Changed Heart: Understanding Conversion

Question: What is absolutely necessary for salvation according to Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 18:3)

Explanation: The word "conversion" simply means a turning or a change from one state to another. Just as water is converted into ice, or a rough field is converted into a garden, a human being must be changed from a state of sin to a state of holiness to fit into God's kingdom. It is not merely an improvement of the old life, but the beginning of a new one.

[DYK] The Greek word often used for "convert" is *strepho*, which implies physically turning around. It suggests that the sinner is walking in one direction (away from God) and must completely pivot to face God.

Question: What are the two essential steps to experience this change?

Biblical Answer: “Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 20:21)

Explanation: Conversion stands on two pillars:
1.  **Repentance toward God:** Recognizing we have broken His law.
2.  **Faith toward Jesus:** Trusting in His sacrifice to fix what we have broken.

Question: Why is repentance necessary, and what defines the sin we must repent of?

Biblical Answer: “Whosoever committeth sin, transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.” (1 John 3:4)

Explanation: To understand why we need a Savior, we must understand what sin is. The Bible defines sin as the breaking of God’s moral law (the Ten Commandments). If there were no law, there would be no standard to measure righteousness.

[ILL] Imagine a mirror. If your face is dirty, the mirror reveals the dirt, but the mirror cannot wash your face. In the same way, the Law reveals our sin (Romans 3:20), but it cannot save us. It points us to the water—Jesus Christ—for cleansing.

Term Definition: "Transgression" means crossing a boundary. God set the boundary of the Law for our protection; crossing it puts us in the territory of sin.

Question: Is repentance merely being sorry for getting caught?

Biblical Answer: “For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)

Progressive Disclosure: True repentance involves:
• Acknowledging the sin
• Feeling "godly sorrow" (sorrow for breaking God's heart, not just fear of punishment)
• Turning away from the sin (Ezekiel 18:30, 31)
• Seeking God's mercy (Isaiah 55:6, 7)

[SN] Historical/Theological Note: The early Advent believers emphasized that the Law and the Gospel must go together. The Law provides the "knowledge of sin" (conviction), while the Gospel provides the remedy. As Paul noted in Romans 7:7, he would not have known lust was wrong unless the Law said, "Thou shalt not covet."

Question: Once we repent, how are we cleansed?

Biblical Answer: “If we walk in the light, as He is in the light... the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth us from all sin. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:7-9)

Explanation: We cannot cleanse ourselves. When we confess, we are dependent entirely on the merits of Jesus Christ. His death pays the penalty for our past, and His life provides power for our present.

Question: What happens to the "old life" of sin?

Biblical Answer: “Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him... Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:6, 4)

Explanation: Paul uses the imagery of death and burial. The "old man" (the desires of the flesh and the habit of sinning) is to be considered dead. Baptism serves as the public funeral of the old life and the resurrection of the new believer.

[DYK] The word "baptize" comes from the Greek *baptizo*, meaning to dip or immerse completely. This reinforces the symbol of burial. A handful of water cannot represent a grave; only full immersion symbolizes being buried with Christ and rising to new life.

Question: What is the result of this "new creation"?

Biblical Answer: “But now ye also put off all these: anger, wrath, malice... Put on therefore, as the elect of God... bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering.” (Colossians 3:8, 12)

Deeper Insight: Conversion changes a person's nature. It is a miracle of divine grace. A converted person does not just stop doing bad things; they receive a new heart that loves doing good things. They exchange "anger and malice" for "kindness and meekness."

Practical Application: Since we are "risen with Christ," where should our focus be today?
• Not on earthly, temporary things.
• But on "things above," where Christ is.
• By setting our affection on heaven, our earthly conduct is transformed.
