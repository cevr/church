Slide 1 Question: What spirit must accompany our prayers for them to be acceptable to God?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any; that your Father also which is in heaven, may forgive you your trespasses.” (Mark 11:25)

Slide 3 Explanation: Prayer is a two-way channel. If the channel of mercy is blocked between us and our fellow man, it is also blocked between God and us. We cannot grasp God’s pardon with one hand while choking our brother with the other.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The verse mentions "standing" to pray. While kneeling is a common posture of humility, standing was a standard Jewish posture for prayer in the synagogue and temple. The physical posture matters less than the posture of the heart.

Slide 5 Question: Is our forgiveness from God conditional upon our forgiveness of others?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.” (Mark 11:26)

Slide 7 Explanation: This is a solemn warning. God does not withhold forgiveness arbitrarily; rather, an unforgiving heart is a hard heart. A heart that refuses to show mercy is incapable of receiving it. The flow of grace must be continuous.

[SN] It is significant that in the Lord’s Prayer, this is the *only* petition to which Jesus adds a specific commentary or condition afterward (Matthew 6:14-15). This highlights the supreme importance of this principle.

Slide 8 Question: How often are we required to forgive someone who wrongs us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter speaking to Jesus, looking inquisitive, holding up fingers to count.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.” (Matthew 18:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus looking with compassion at Peter, soft light surrounding them, emphasizing infinite patience.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Peter thought he was being generous by suggesting seven times, as rabbinical teaching often suggested three times was sufficient. Jesus’ answer implies that forgiveness is not a mathematical count, but a limitless attribute of character.

Slide 11 Question: How does Jesus illustrate the difference between what we owe God and what others owe us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king sitting on a throne, looking down at a servant bowing low in desperation.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king... one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents... the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.” (Matthew 18:23-27)

Slide 13 The Parable Explained: In the parable, the servant owed the king ten thousand talents—an unpayable sum. Yet, after being forgiven, he attacked a fellow servant who owed him a mere hundred pence.

Slide 14 Perspective on Debt:
*   **Ten Thousand Talents:** Millions of dollars in modern currency—a debt impossible to pay in a lifetime.
*   **Hundred Pence:** Roughly a few months' wages.

[DYK] This contrast shows that our sins against God are infinite compared to the finite wrongs others commit against us.

---

Slide 15 Illustration: Imagine a man whose multi-million dollar mortgage is cancelled by a benevolent bank, who then immediately goes outside and bashes his neighbor for borrowing five dollars. This captures the absurdity of an unforgiving Christian.

Slide 16 Question: Is it sufficient to forgive in words only, or to forgive while holding a memory of the wrong?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking pensive, holding a hand over their heart.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “So likewise shall My heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses.” (Matthew 18:35)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a light emanating from a person's chest, representing the heart's true intent.

---

Slide 18 Term Definition: **The Grudge**
The source text clarifies that saying "I can forgive, but I cannot forget" is actually "holding a grudge." True forgiveness, like God's, casts the offense away. It must be done "from the heart."

Slide 19 Insight on Restoration: When a brother or sister falls, Galatians 6:1 instructs us to restore them in a "spirit of meekness." We are not to be superior judges, but fellow travelers who recognize we too could be tempted.

Slide 20 Question: Whose example are we to follow when we forgive?

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you so also do ye.” (Colossians 3:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ washing the disciples' feet, showing humility and service.

---

Slide 22 Deeper Insight: We do not originate forgiveness; we reflect it. We forgive "even as" Christ forgave us. His forgiveness was sacrificial, unmerited, and complete.

Slide 23 Practical Application:
The law of forgiveness is essential for spiritual health.

1.  **Self-Examination**: Do I have "aught against any"?
2.  **Action**: If a sin is confessed, we must forgive and "comfort" to prevent despair.
3.  **Attitude**: We must show mercy cheerfully, not grudgingly.
