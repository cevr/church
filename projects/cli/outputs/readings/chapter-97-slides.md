Study Title: The Author of Liberty

---

Slide 1 Question: How does God respond to human suffering and oppression?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast desert landscape under a twilight sky, with silhouettes of weary laborers in the distance, conveying a mood of longing and heaviness.

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried... And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant... I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.” (Exodus 2:23-24; 3:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Israelites working in mud and brick in Egypt, their faces turned upward toward the sky, soft light breaking through clouds above them.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God is not indifferent to the plight of the enslaved or the suffering. The Bible reveals a God who hears, sees, and remembers His promises. His response to the physical slavery of Israel becomes the pattern for His response to spiritual slavery.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know?: The Hebrew word for "groaning" implies a deep, guttural cry of distress. It signifies that even when we cannot form words for our pain, God understands the language of our sighs.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a solitary figure in prayer, head bowed low in shadows, illuminated by a single shaft of warm light representing divine understanding.

---

Slide 5 Question: What is the foundation of God's Law?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses descending a mountain, holding stone tablets, with a vast camp of tents visible in the valley below.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” (Exodus 20:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Red Sea parting, walls of water on either side, with people walking through on dry ground, light reflecting off the water.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Before God gave the Ten Commandments, He identified Himself as the Liberator. Obedience to God’s law is not a means to earn freedom, but a response of gratitude for freedom already granted. True law protects liberty.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scroll open on a wooden table, with broken chains lying beside it, symbolizing law and liberty together.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: Consider a train (or a chariot). It is only "free" to move at high speeds and carry heavy loads when it stays on the tracks. If it jumps the tracks to be "free" of them, it becomes stuck. God's law is the track that allows human liberty to function safely.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a chariot moving swiftly along a well-paved stone road, contrasted with a broken wheel stuck in chaotic mire off the path.

---

Slide 9 Question: How does God expect those He has freed to treat others?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two men in ancient robes clasping hands, one clearly wealthier helping one who is poorer, bathed in golden afternoon light.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty... thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.” (Deuteronomy 15:13-15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master giving gifts of grain and livestock to a servant who is departing, both smiling with mutual respect.

---

Slide 11 Progressive Disclosure:
• Empathy born of experience (“remember you were a bondman”)
• Generosity (“furnish him liberally”)
• Protection of the vulnerable (“thou shalt neither vex a stranger”)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family sharing a meal with a stranger in their tent, soft candlelight illuminating faces full of kindness.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: “Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:10) was a specific fifty-year cycle in Israel’s economy where liberty was proclaimed throughout the land, debts were cancelled, and ancestral lands were returned. It prevented permanent poverty and generational slavery.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a priest blowing a silver trumpet on a hillside, with people in the valley below raising their hands in joy and celebration.

---

Slide 13 Speaker Note: The Jubilee is a type (a prophetic symbol) of the final restoration of the earth. Just as the trumpet sounded liberty on the Day of Atonement, the "last trump" will signal the ultimate return of God’s people to their lost possession—Eden.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lush, restored garden landscape, reminiscent of Eden, with a golden light on the horizon symbolizing the future restoration.

---

Slide 14 Question: What is the relationship between the Sabbath and liberty?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a peaceful sunset over an ancient village, tools laid aside, and families gathering for rest.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt... therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.” (Deuteronomy 5:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people—elders, children, and servants—resting together under a tree, enjoying a day of peace.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: While Exodus 20 links the Sabbath to Creation, Deuteronomy links it to Redemption. The Sabbath is a weekly declaration of freedom—a time when neither master nor servant labors. It is a memorial that we are not merely units of production, but free children of God.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a broken yoke lying in a field of wheat, symbolizing the cessation of burden and labor.

---

Slide 17 Question: What constitutes acceptable worship in God's eyes?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people entering a temple, but the focus is on a figure outside the temple helping a beggar rise to his feet.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?” (Isaiah 58:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands untying a thick, knotted rope, with soft light emphasizing the action of release.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: Religious forms—fasting, praying, attending gatherings—are rejected by God if they coexist with oppression and selfishness. True revival (reformation) always leads to practical benevolence and the restoration of rights to the downtrodden.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bread loaf being broken and shared among the poor, depicted with the solemnity of a religious ritual.

---

Slide 20 Question: What is the deepest form of slavery that Christ came to abolish?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man sitting in a dark corner, physically unchained but looking anguished and trapped within his own mind.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.” (John 8:34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure in shadows, bound by shadowy, ethereal chains representing vices like anger or greed.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Political liberty is vital, but Christ addresses the root cause of all bondage. A man may be free from chains yet be a slave to anger, addiction, or selfishness.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting contrasting a king on a throne who looks miserable and trapped, with a humble servant who looks peaceful and free.

---

Slide 23 Question: How does Jesus define His mission regarding this slavery?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing in a synagogue, holding an open scroll, reading to an attentive audience.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me... to preach deliverance to the captives... to set at liberty them that are bruised.” (Luke 4:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus reaching out to touch the shoulder of a downtrodden person, with a dove (symbol of the Spirit) faintly visible in the light above.

---

Slide 25 Speaker Note: The link between the Spirit and Liberty is vital. Paul writes, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Corinthians 3:17). This is not liberty *to* sin, which brings bondage, but liberty *from* sin, which brings peace.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heart glowing with internal light, symbolizing the Law written on the heart by the Spirit.

---

Slide 26 Question: What is the "Golden Rule" of liberty?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a set of measuring scales, perfectly balanced, symbolizing equity and reciprocity.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” (Matthew 7:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a marketplace scene where a merchant is treating a customer with exaggerated kindness and fairness.

---

Slide 28 Practical Application: True liberty is unselfish.
• In the Home: Serving one another.
• In the Church: Leaders as servants.
• In Society: Defending the rights of others.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus washing the feet of the disciples, the ultimate image of servant-leadership and unselfish liberty.

---

Slide 29 Final Thought: “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” (John 8:36)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing on a mountaintop at sunrise, arms outstretched, facing the light, completely free.
