Slide 3 Explanation: Scripture reveals that God’s family is not limited to human beings. It encompasses a vast, united community spanning both the earthly and the heavenly realms.

Both angels and believers are referred to in Scripture as “sons of God” (Job 1:6; 1 John 3:1), indicating a shared relationship with the Creator.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The phrase “whole family” suggests a bond of unity. Though separated by nature and location, the loyal inhabitants of heaven and the redeemed of earth belong to the same Father.

Slide 5 Question: Did angels exist before human history began?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?” (Job 38:6, 7)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: God asks Job who was present at the creation of the world. The “morning stars” and “sons of God” (angels) were already in existence, rejoicing as they witnessed the laying of earth's foundations.

Slide 8 Evidence from Eden: Furthermore, after the fall of man, cherubim were placed at Eden to guard the way to the tree of life (Genesis 3:24), proving they existed before any human had died.

Term Definition: **Cherubim** are a high order of angelic beings often associated with God’s holiness and the guarding of His throne.

Slide 9 Speaker Note: A Pioneer Perspective

Early Adventists strongly emphasized that angels are a separate creation from humans. Because they existed before human death (as seen in Eden), and because Scripture says the dead "know not anything" (Eccl 9:5), angels cannot be the spirits of deceased ancestors. They are a distinct order of beings created to serve God.

Slide 10 Question: Are angels merely symbolic spirits, or are they real beings?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham looking out from his tent toward three approaching figures in the desert heat.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And he [Abraham] took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.” (Genesis 18:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of three angelic visitors seated under a large oak tree, eating food while Abraham attends to them.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: When angels visited Abraham, they did not merely appear as visions; they interacted with the physical world, sat under a tree, and ate food. This demonstrates they are real, tangible beings.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on the hands of an angel accepting food, emphasizing physical reality and texture.

---

Slide 13 Illustration: Think of electricity. You cannot see the current itself, but it is real and powerful. However, angels are even more than a force; they are intelligent agents who can step into our visible reality when God commands.

Slide 14 Question: What is the primary work or "job description" of angels regarding humans?

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?” (Hebrews 1:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an angel gently guiding a person along a rocky path, soft protective light.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The central mission of the angelic host is service. They are not sent merely to rule or observe, but to "minister"—to serve, aid, and assist—those who are accepting God's gift of salvation.

Slide 17 Progressive Disclosure: Their Ministry
• They encamp around those who fear God (Psalm 34:7).
• They deliver God's servants (Daniel 6:22).
• They strengthen the weary (1 Kings 19:7-8).

[DYK] The word "angel" (Hebrew *malak*, Greek *angelos*) literally means "messenger." Their very name describes their function.

Slide 18 Question: Do angels take a personal interest in our spiritual choices?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in repentance, with a shaft of light falling upon them.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.” (Luke 15:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a heavenly court filled with radiant figures expressing pure joy and celebration.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Angels are emotionally invested in the plan of salvation. They are not indifferent robots; the repentance of a single human causes celebration in the courts of heaven.

Conversely, Scripture warns us to be mindful of our words and vows because angels are present as witnesses (Ecclesiastes 5:5, 6).

Slide 21 Question: What role do angels play in the judgment and the Second Coming?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of clouds parting, revealing a brilliant golden light and the silhouette of a throne.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “The judgment was set, and the books were opened... thousand thousands ministered unto Him.” (Daniel 7:10)

“And He shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds...” (Matthew 24:31)

---

Slide 23 Explanation: Angels are deeply involved in the final events of history. They are present when the records of life are reviewed in the judgment. Finally, when Christ returns, He does not come alone; He brings the "innumerable company" of angels to gather the redeemed.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of angels descending from the sky, gathering people from fields and cities.

---

Slide 24 Deeper Insight: In Revelation 3:5, Jesus promises to confess the names of overcomers "before My Father, and before His angels." This suggests that the angels, who have watched our struggles and ministered to us, will witness our final vindication.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ standing before a throne, gesturing toward a believer, with angels looking on in approval.

---

Slide 25 Spirit-Led Tangent: The Fourth Man

Consider the "Fourth Man" in the fiery furnace (Daniel 3:25). Nebuchadnezzar saw a form "like the Son of God." While angels minister, this specific instance is often viewed by theologians as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ Himself, joining His people in their trials.

Whether Christ or a mighty angel, the lesson is clear: Heaven is closest when we are in the fire for God's truth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of three men standing in a furnace fire, unharmed, with a fourth radiant, divine figure standing beside them.

---

Slide 26 Practical Application: How should the reality of angels affect our daily lives?

• **Courage:** We are never truly alone; God’s forces outnumber the enemy.
• **Conduct:** We should live with dignity, knowing heavenly witnesses observe our words and actions.
• **Gratitude:** We can thank God for the unseen protection He provides every day.
