Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me... O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee...” (John 17:11, 25)

Slide 3 Explanation: In His hour of crisis, Jesus focused on two pillars of God's character:
1.  **Holiness:** Absolute purity and separation from sin.
2.  **Righteousness:** Perfect integrity and equity.

Jesus entrusted His disciples not to a capricious deity, but to a Holy and Righteous Father.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the intimacy of the address "Father" combined with the reverence of "Holy" and "Righteous." This balance of awe and intimacy is the heart of true prayer.

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” (Acts 2:27)

“By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.” (Isaiah 53:11)

Slide 6 The Fulfillment:
*   **The Holy One:** The apostles recognized Jesus as the fulfillment of David's prophecy—the Holy One who conquered death.
*   **The Righteous Servant:** Isaiah predicted a Messiah who is not only righteous Himself but has the power to make others righteous.

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.” (Exodus 34:6)

---

Slide 10 Explanation: When God revealed His glory, He did not proclaim His power or size, but His character. His glory *is* His goodness.

[DYK] The word "Longsuffering" literally means "long of nose" (slow to anger/breathing deeply to restrain wrath). It implies that God is incredibly patient with our failures, giving us ample time to repent.

Slide 11 Question: How was this goodness and mercy demonstrated in the life of Jesus?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.” (Acts 10:38)

[ILL] Jesus was the "express image" of the Father. Just as a mirror reflects the face of the one looking into it, Jesus’ life of healing and compassion reflected the "merciful and gracious" character of the God declared in Exodus.

Slide 13 Question: Can we rely on God’s promises and justice?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him... to a thousand generations.” (Deuteronomy 7:9)

“He is the Rock, his work is perfect... a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.” (Deuteronomy 32:4)

Slide 15 Explanation: God is not only loving; He is stable.
*   **The Rock:** Suggests immovability.
*   **God of Truth:** Because He is just, the universe operates on moral laws that are as dependable as physical laws.

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Truth is a Person.
Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). To know the Truth is to know Christ.

Slide 17 Question: Does God possess wisdom beyond our understanding?

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.” (Job 36:5)

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Notice the pairing in Job—God is mighty, yet He "despiseth not any." Human power often leads to arrogance and looking down on the weak. Divine power is coupled with perfect wisdom and humility, caring for the lowly.

Slide 19 Question: Will God’s character ever change?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an hourglass with sand running out, set against an eternal light background.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Everything in creation is subject to decay and change. God alone is **Immutable** (unchanging).

The attributes we have studied—holiness, mercy, truth, justice—are permanent. He will never be less merciful or less just than He is today.

Slide 22 Question: Can we fully comprehend God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing on a cliff overlooking a vast, endless ocean, portraying awe.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a deep forest with shafts of light penetrating the canopy, symbolizing mystery and depth.

---

Slide 24 Illustration: The Ocean
A child may stand on the shore and touch the ocean, knowing it is wet and salty. They truly *know* the ocean, yet they cannot comprehend its vast depths or hidden trenches.

Similarly, we can truly know God through His Word, even though His infinite nature remains beyond our full grasp.

Slide 25 Practical Application: Because God is...

*   **Holy:** We should approach Him with reverence.
*   **Merciful:** We can come to Him with our failures.
*   **Faithful:** We can trust His promises in uncertain times.
*   **Unchanging:** We have a solid Rock in a shifting world.
