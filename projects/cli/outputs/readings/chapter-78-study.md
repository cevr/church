Study Title: The Two Laws: What Was Abolished?

Question: Did Jesus come to destroy the Law of God?

Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets; I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:17-18)

Explanation: Jesus explicitly stated that He did not come to dismantle the moral law. The phrase "fulfill" here implies filling it full of meaning, obedience, and realization, much like a builder follows a blueprint to completion rather than ripping it up. As long as heaven and earth remain, God’s moral standard remains.

[ILL] Imagine a teacher who perfectly demonstrates how to solve a complex math equation. By solving it, they haven't "abolished" the rules of mathematics; they have "fulfilled" or established them. Jesus magnified the law by showing us how to live it perfectly.

Question: If the Moral Law remains, what explicitly *did* Jesus abolish at the cross?

Biblical Answer: “Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.” (Ephesians 2:15)

Explanation: Paul speaks here of a specific type of law—the "law of commandments contained in ordinances." This refers to the ceremonial system (sacrifices, feast days, circumcision) which pointed forward to Christ. Once the reality (Christ) came, the shadows (rituals) were no longer needed.

[DYK] The "middle wall of partition" mentioned in Ephesians 2:14 alludes to a literal physical barrier in the Jewish Temple. It separated the Court of the Gentiles from the inner courts. Signs warned that any Gentile crossing it would face death. Christ spiritually demolished this barrier, uniting Jew and Gentile.

Question: How do we know the "abolished" law was not the Ten Commandments?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” (Romans 7:12) AND “For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not grievous.” (1 John 5:3)

Explanation: Paul describes the Moral Law as holy, just, and good. In Ephesians, the abolished law is called "enmity" (hostility). Something that is "holy and good" cannot be "enmity." Therefore, the law that was removed was the system of exclusive ceremonies that created hostility between Jews and Gentiles, not the Ten Commandments which define love for God and man.

Progressive Disclosure:
• **Moral Law:** Reveals sin (Rom 3:20), is eternal, written on stone.
• **Ceremonial Law:** Prescribed remedies for sin (sacrifices), was temporary, written in a book.
• **The Cross:** Ratified the Moral Law (showing sin has a cost) and terminated the Ceremonial Law (the ultimate Sacrifice was made).

[SN] The logic of Sin: The Bible defines sin as "the transgression of the law" (1 John 3:4). Romans 5:13 states, "sin is not imputed when there is no law." If the Ten Commandments were abolished at the cross, then sin no longer exists, and we would need no Savior. The very fact that we still need a Savior proves the Law that identifies sin is still in effect.

Question: With the ceremonial rites (like circumcision) gone, what remains of the utmost importance for the believer?

Biblical Answer: “Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.” (1 Corinthians 7:19)

Explanation: This is a crucial summary. The ritual (circumcision) is declared "nothing"—it is abolished. However, the "keeping of the commandments of God" is contrasted against it as the thing that remains binding and vital.

Term Definition: **"The Law"** in Scripture can refer to different things depending on context.
1. **The Decalogue:** The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20).
2. **The Ceremonial Law:** The system of types and shadows (Hebrews 10:1).
3. **The Pentateuch:** The first five books of Moses (Luke 24:44).
We must look at the context (what is being said about the law) to know which is being referred to.

Deeper Insight: The ceremonial law was placed "in the side of the ark" (Deuteronomy 31:26) as a witness, while the Ten Commandments were placed *inside* the Ark of the Covenant under the Mercy Seat (Exodus 25:16). One was a temporary instructional manual; the other was the eternal foundation of God's throne.

Practical Application: Why does this distinction matter today?
• It protects us from legalism (trying to earn salvation through rituals).
• It protects us from lawlessness (thinking we are free to sin).
• It clarifies that while we are saved by grace alone, we are saved *to* a life of obedience.
• We no longer sacrifice lambs, but we still refrain from stealing, lying, and idolatry.
