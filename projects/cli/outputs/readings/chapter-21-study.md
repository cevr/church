Study Title: Reconciled to God: From Enmity to Peace

Question: What is the natural state of the human mind, and how does it relate to God?

Biblical Answer: “The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” (Romans 8:7)

Explanation: The term "carnal" refers to the fleshly, natural human nature apart from the Holy Spirit. This text reveals a startling truth: our natural inclination is not merely indifferent to God, but actively hostile ("enmity") toward Him. This hostility is proven by a refusal to submit to God’s law.

Term Definition: **Enmity** means deep-seated, mutual hatred or hostility. It is the state of being an enemy.

[ILL] Imagine a stream flowing downhill. It is the nature of the water to go down. It cannot suddenly decide to flow uphill; it requires a pump or an external force to change its direction. Similarly, the carnal mind flows naturally toward self and sin; it cannot submit to God without the power of the Holy Spirit.

Question: What is the ultimate result of remaining in this carnal state?

Biblical Answer: “For to be carnally minded is death.” (Romans 8:6)

Explanation: Because the carnal mind rejects the Source of Life (God) and violates the principles of life (God’s Law), the inevitable result is death. As Romans 6:23 confirms, "the wages of sin is death."

[DYK] In the biblical worldview, death is not just the cessation of breath; it is total separation from God. This was the warning given in Eden, and it remains the consequence of the carnal nature today.

Question: Since we cannot fix ourselves, what offers does God make to us?

Biblical Answer: “We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20)

Explanation: Despite our natural hostility, God takes the initiative. He sends ambassadors to plead for peace. To be "reconciled" means to be restored to friendship and harmony after a period of estrangement.

[SN] In the Great Controversy between good and evil, God has been misrepresented as a tyrant. Here, Paul paints God not as a judge eagerly waiting to punish, but as a loving Father pleading through His servants for His children to come home.

Question: What acts on our part are necessary to accept this reconciliation?

Biblical Answer: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.” (Acts 3:19) | “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)

Explanation: Reconciliation requires a response.
1.  **Repentance:** A genuine sorrow for sin and a turning away from it.
2.  **Confession:** Acknowledging our specific faults to God.
3.  **Conversion:** A change of direction.
As seen in the story of Nineveh (Jonah 3), God responds to those who turn from their "evil way."

Deeper Insight: The text mentions sins being "blotted out." This implies a record was kept. In the sanctuary service, the record of sin is removed, signifying a complete cleansing of the conscience and the record books of heaven.

Question: How thorough is this change within the believer?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Explanation: Salvation is not a renovation; it is a re-creation. The "old man" (the carnal mind) is crucified (Romans 6:6), meaning the ruling power of self is broken. A new nature, implanted by Christ, takes its place.

[ILL] A caterpillar does not merely sprout wings to become a butterfly; it undergoes a metamorphosis where it is structurally changed into a completely new creature. So it is with the believer "in Christ."

Question: How can we tell if a person has truly been reconciled and changed?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matthew 7:20) | “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Galatians 5:22, 23)

Explanation: The evidence of the "new creature" is not just what they say, but how they live. "Fruit" describes the natural byproduct of a healthy tree. If the Spirit is the root, a Christ-like character is the fruit.

[SN] Note that "fruit" is singular in the Greek text. We do not pick and choose which virtues to have; the Holy Spirit produces a single, unified character that reflects the life of Jesus in all these dimensions.

Question: What is the final standing of the one who is reconciled to God?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:1) | “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus...” (Romans 8:1)

Explanation: The journey ends in peace. "Justification" means God declares the sinner righteous. The war is over. The hostility of the carnal mind is replaced by the peace of the spiritual mind. There is no longer any condemnation hanging over the believer's head.

Practical Application:
*   **Identify:** Do you sense the "carnal" pull toward selfishness or anger? That is the old nature.
*   **Confess:** Do not hide it. Take it to God immediately.
*   **Believe:** Accept that if you are in Christ, you are a new creation. You are not defined by your past.
*   **Walk:** Step forward today in the "no condemnation" zone, guided by the Spirit.
