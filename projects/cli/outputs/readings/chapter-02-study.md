Study Title: Searching the Scriptures: Christ the Center

Question: What instruction did Jesus give regarding the study of the Scriptures?

Biblical Answer: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” (John 5:39)

Explanation: When Jesus spoke these words, the "New Testament" had not yet been written. He was directing the people to the Old Testament. He corrected a common error: the Jewish leaders believed that simply possessing the holy writings gave them eternal life. Jesus clarified that the Scriptures are a guide meant to lead us to Him, the Source of life.

[DYK] The word translated "search" implies digging deep, like a miner hunting for gold. It suggests that the most valuable truths are not always lying on the surface but require diligent effort to find.

Question: Was the "Gospel" (Good News about Jesus) known to people in the Old Testament, such as Abraham?

Biblical Answer: “And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham...” (Galatians 3:8)

Explanation: The plan of salvation is not a new invention of the New Testament. The Apostle Paul confirms that the very same Gospel we believe today was preached to Abraham. While we look backward to the Cross, the patriarchs looked forward to it through faith and the sacrificial system.

[ILL] Imagine a long procession. Those at the front of the line (the Patriarchs) and those at the back of the line (us today) are all following the same Leader, even though they view Him from different angles.

Question: Did the Israelites in the wilderness understand that Christ was their Provider?

Biblical Answer: “...and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” (1 Corinthians 10:4)

Explanation: The source text reveals a profound truth: The Being who led Israel, provided water from the rock, and offered spiritual sustenance was none other than Christ Himself. Even Moses, when leaving Egypt, chose to suffer affliction because he esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt" (Hebrews 11:26).

Term Definition: "Dispensation" often refers to a period of time in history. While methods of teaching (like symbols and sacrifices) may change between dispensations, the method of salvation—faith in Christ—remains eternal.

[SN] This touches on the "Everlasting Covenant." Early Adventists emphasized that God does not change. The "God of the Old Testament" is not harsh while Jesus is gentle; rather, Jesus *is* the God of the Old Testament, leading His people with patience long before His incarnation.

Question: How can the Old Testament help us understand Jesus today?

Biblical Answer: “Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture [Isaiah], and preached unto him Jesus.” (Acts 8:35)

Explanation: In this account, an Ethiopian traveler was reading the prophet Isaiah but could not understand it. Philip did not tell him to put away the Old Testament; instead, he used that very text to reveal Jesus. The Old Testament is the foundation upon which the New Testament is built (Ephesians 2:20).

Deeper Insight: The Bible is one complete book. The Old Testament is the Gospel concealed in types and shadows; the New Testament is the Gospel revealed in clarity. You cannot fully understand one without the other.

Question: What attitude should we have when studying the Bible?

Biblical Answer: “These [Bereans] were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” (Acts 17:11)

Explanation: The Bereans are set forth as the model for all Bible students. Their "nobility" came from two traits:
1.  **Openness:** They listened with "readiness of mind."
2.  **Verification:** They did not blindly accept what Paul taught; they "searched the scriptures daily" to prove the truth for themselves.

[DYK] In the ancient world, having access to the scrolls daily was a privilege. Today, having a Bible in our own home is a blessing we often overlook.

Question: How vital is the Word of God to our spiritual existence?

Biblical Answer: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4:4)

Explanation: Just as physical bread sustains the body, God’s Word sustains the soul. We cannot survive spiritually on the "food" we ate yesterday; we need a fresh intake of God's Word daily.

[SN] Tangent on the "Living Word" vs. "Written Word": Psalm 138:2 says God has magnified His word above His name. The written Word is the vehicle through which we encounter the Living Word (Jesus). Neglecting the Bible is, in effect, neglecting Christ.

Practical Application:
Based on these texts, how should we approach our Bible study?
*   **Look for Jesus:** In every story, law, and prophecy, ask, "What does this reveal about Christ?"
*   **Daily Diet:** Read Scripture not just for information, but for spiritual survival.
*   **Verify Truth:** Like the Bereans, do not rely solely on what others say; open the Book and see for yourself.
