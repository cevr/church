Study Title: The Sufferings of Christ

Question: What was the primary purpose of Jesus Christ coming into the world?

Biblical Answer: “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” (1 Timothy 1:15)

Explanation: Christ’s mission was not merely to teach morality or set a good example, but specifically to rescue humanity from the condition of sin.

[DYK] The phrase "faithful saying" indicates a creed or hymn used by the early church. It highlights that the salvation of sinners was the core foundational truth of the first Christians.

Question: What motivated God to make such a sacrifice?

Biblical Answer: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)

Explanation: The driving force behind the plan of salvation is divine love. The Father was not reluctant; He voluntarily gave His most precious possession to save a perishing world.

[ILL] Imagine a judge who must sentence a guilty criminal, but then steps down from the bench to pay the fine himself. God’s justice required a penalty for sin, but His love provided the payment through His Son.

Question: Was the suffering of Christ unexpected, or was it foretold?

Biblical Answer: “He was oppressed, and He was afflicted, yet He opened not his mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter... for the transgression of my people was He stricken.” (Isaiah 53:7, 8)

Explanation: Centuries before the cross, the prophet Isaiah described the Messiah as a sacrificial lamb. Jesus knew exactly what awaited Him and went forward voluntarily.

Term Definition: “Stricken” implies being struck with a heavy blow or distinct punishment. In this context, it refers to Christ receiving the blow of justice that was due to the transgressor.

Question: How intense was the Saviour’s anguish when the weight of the world’s sin began to press upon Him in Gethsemane?

Biblical Answer: “And being in an agony He prayed more earnestly: and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” (Luke 22:44)

Explanation: The mental and spiritual weight of carrying the world's guilt caused a physical reaction so severe that His capillaries burst, mixing blood with sweat. This agony was not the fear of physical death, but the horror of separation from the Father caused by sin.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This phenomenon is known medically as *hematidrosis*. It occurs only under extreme degrees of stress. It signifies that the shedding of blood for our atonement began not on the cross, but in the garden, as Jesus mentally accepted the "cup" of God's wrath against sin.

Question: How did humanity respond to this love during His trial?

Biblical Answer: “And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon His head, and a reed in His right hand: and they bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him, saying Hail, King of the Jews!” (Matthew 27:29)

Explanation: The creatures mocked the Creator. They used symbols of royalty (a crown, a scepter/reed, a robe) to humiliate Him, unaware that He was indeed the King of the Universe submitting to this shame for their sakes.

[DYK] The "crown of thorns" was likely made from the long, hard spikes of the date palm or a similar Judean thorn bush. It was not just a symbol of mockery, but an instrument of severe torture.

Question: What was Jesus' attitude toward those who were killing Him?

Biblical Answer: “Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:34)

Explanation: Even in the extremity of pain, Christ’s focus remained on interceding for sinners. He did not curse His tormentors; He prayed for them.

Question: How did nature react when the Son of God died?

Biblical Answer: “And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.” (Luke 23:44, 45)

Explanation: The physical darkness represented the spiritual darkness of that hour. The tearing of the temple veil—from top to bottom—signified that the earthly sacrificial system was over. The true Lamb had died; the way to God was now open to all.

Deeper Insight: The rending of the veil signaled the transition from the earthly sanctuary to the heavenly sanctuary. No longer would animals need to be slain; Christ’s "finished" work (John 19:30) is sufficient.

Question: What assurance do we have now, knowing that God gave His Son?

Biblical Answer: “He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?” (Romans 8:32)

Explanation: This is the logic of the cross. If God has already given the greatest gift possible—His Son—we can be certain He will not withhold any lesser gift needed for our salvation.

Practical Application: Because Christ suffered for us: • We can find forgiveness for the darkest sins • We have a High Priest who understands our pain • We can trust God’s love even when life is difficult.
