Study Title: The Divine Order of the Home

Question: When and where was the institution of marriage established?

Biblical Answer: “And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.” (Genesis 2:22)

Explanation: Marriage is of divine origin. It was not a human invention developed over centuries of social evolution; it was instituted in Eden by the Creator Himself before the fall of man. Like the Sabbath, it is a gift from Paradise designed for the benefit of the human race.

[DYK] The word "woman" in Hebrew (*ishshah*) is linguistically derived from "man" (*ish*). This reinforces the idea that she was taken *out* of man to be part *of* him—equal in nature and standing.

Question: What was God’s specific purpose and arithmetic for marriage?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24)

Progressive Disclosure:
• **Companionship**: “It is not good that the man should be alone.” (Genesis 2:18)
• **Unity**: The math of heaven is not one plus one equals two, but two becoming one.
• **Procreation**: To “replenish the earth” with a godly lineage.

[ILL] Think of two streams merging into a single river. Once they join, the waters cannot be separated into their original sources. They flow together toward a common destination. This is the "one flesh" principle.

Term Definition: “Help meet” (Genesis 2:18) does not mean a servant or a subordinate. The original Hebrew implies a helper that is "opposite" or "corresponding to" him—like a mirror image or a perfect counterpart that completes what is lacking.

Question: If God designed marriage for one man and one woman, where did polygamy come from?

Biblical Answer: “And Lamech took unto him two wives... and Lamech said unto his wives... I have slain a man.” (See Genesis 4:19, 23 and John 8:44)

Explanation: Polygamy originated not with God’s people, but in the line of Cain—specifically with Lamech, a man noted for murder and rebellion. It is a counterfeit of the divine plan. The text suggests that as men moved away from the truth of God, they moved toward the corruption of marriage.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Notice the pattern in Genesis. The "sons of God" (the lineage of Seth) maintained the original order until they began to mix with the "daughters of men" (the lineage of Cain). When the distinct line between the church and the world blurred, the sanctity of the home was lost, leading to the Flood.

Question: How do we account for Bible heroes like Abraham, Jacob, or David having multiple wives?

Biblical Answer: “Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.” (Ecclesiastes 7:29)

Explanation: The Bible records the sins of holy men, but it does not endorse them.
• **Abraham**: His union with Hagar was a lack of faith in God's promise, instigated by Sarah. It resulted in sorrow and separation (Genesis 21).
• **Jacob**: He was deceived into marrying Leah, and then took Rachel. His life was marked by family strife and jealousy between the sisters.
• **David**: His departure from God's law led to tragedy in his household.

Deeper Insight: God blessed these men *because of their repentance* and faith, not because of their polygamy. In every instance where the original plan was violated, the Bible records heartache, rivalry, and spiritual decline as the result.

[DYK] When God preserved the human race through the Flood, He returned to the original plan. Only Noah and his three sons, each with *one* wife (eight people total), entered the ark.

Question: Did Jesus and the apostles change or reaffirm the original plan?

Biblical Answer: “From the beginning of the creation God made them male and female... What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (Mark 10:6-9)

Explanation: Jesus pointed back to "the beginning"—before custom and culture corrupted the institution. The Apostle Paul confirmed this for church leadership, requiring a bishop to be "the husband of one wife" (1 Timothy 3:2).

Practical Application: How can we honor the marriage institution today?
• Treat marriage as a holy covenant, not just a civil contract.
• Guard the mind against modern "counterfeits" that dilute the commitment of "one flesh."
• If single, seek a partner who honors God's original design.
• If married, view your spouse as your God-given counterpart, essential for your mutual sanctification.
