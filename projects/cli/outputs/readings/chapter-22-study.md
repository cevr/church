Study Title: God's Willingness to Forgive

Question: How does God treat us regarding our sins?

Biblical Answer: “He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities... For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward them that fear Him.” (Psalm 103:10-11)

Explanation: Justice gives what is deserved; mercy gives what is needed. The text indicates that God holds back the punishment we naturally deserve. He measures His mercy not by human standards, but by the vast distance between heaven and earth—implying it is immeasurable and limitless.

[DYK] In the Hebrew text, the word for "mercy" is often *chesed*, implying a steadfast, covenant loyalty. It is not a fleeting emotion, but a committed love that persists despite our failures.

Question: What is the Lord’s attitude toward those who ask for pardon?

Biblical Answer: “For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.” (Psalm 86:5)

Term Definition: “Ready to forgive” implies that God does not need to be persuaded or begged to become merciful. His posture is already one of forgiveness; He is simply waiting for us to ask so He can legally and relationally grant it.

[ILL] Imagine a father standing at the door with the latch unlocked, waiting for his child to knock. He doesn't need to be convinced to open the door; he is already standing there, ready.

Question: What are the conditions for receiving this forgiveness?

Biblical Answer: “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9) Also: “Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts...” (Isaiah 55:7)

Explanation: Confession is the key that unlocks the storehouse of mercy. It is not merely admitting a fact, but agreeing with God that sin is evil. The promise in Isaiah adds that true repentance involves a change in "way" (actions) and "thoughts" (mindset).

[SN] Note the phrase "faithful and just." We often think forgiveness is an act of grace (which it is), but John calls it an act of *justice*. Because Christ has paid the price for sin, God is *just* in forgiving the penitent. He would be unjust to demand payment twice—once from Jesus and once from you.

Question: How did God demonstrate His love before we ever asked for it?

Biblical Answer: “But God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)

Deeper Insight: This verse destroys the idea that we must fix ourselves before coming to God. The provision for salvation was made while humanity was at its worst. If He loved us enough to die for us while we were rebels, how much more will He receive us now that we return?

Question: How does God respond when a sinner finally returns home?

Biblical Answer: “But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.” (Luke 15:20)

Progressive Disclosure: • The Father was watching (expectancy) • The Father ran (eagerness) • The Father kissed him (full acceptance) • The Father feasted (celebration)

[DYK] In the ancient Near Eastern culture, it was considered undignified for an elderly man or a patriarch to run. He would have to hike up his robes, exposing his legs, which was shameful. The father in the parable risked shame to protect his son from the shame of the village.

Question: Does God ever forget those who cry out to Him?

Biblical Answer: “Can a woman forget her sucking child?... Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.” (Isaiah 49:15)

Explanation: The strongest human bond known is that of a nursing mother to her infant. Yet, even this bond is breakable in a fallen world. God’s memory of His children, however, is permanent and unbreakable.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The assurance of salvation. Early Adventists and reformers emphasized that our confidence is not in our memory of God, but in His memory of us. We are "graven upon the palms of His hands" (Isaiah 49:16)—a reference to the scars of the Crucifixion. He cannot look at His hands without remembering who He saved.

Practical Application: Since God is "ready to forgive," what holds us back? • Pride? • Fear that we are too bad? • Doubt of His word? Today, we can claim the promise of Isaiah 55:7: He will not just pardon, He will *abundantly* pardon.
