Slide 1 Title: The New Birth: Transforming the Heart

Slide 2 Question: What is the natural spiritual condition of every human being?

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)

“Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.” (Jeremiah 13:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a leopard resting in a dry wilderness, emphasizing the natural permanence of its markings under a hot sun.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Scripture teaches that humanity is naturally separated from God. Just as a leopard cannot will its spots away because they are part of its nature, we cannot change our sinful nature through sheer willpower or self-improvement. We are dependent on an outside power for transformation.

---

Slide 5 Illustration: You can paint a leopard white, but it remains a leopard underneath; the spots will eventually show through. Similarly, outward behavior modification does not change the heart. The nature itself must be changed.

---

Slide 6 Question: Since we cannot change ourselves, how are we brought back to God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking upward toward a break in the clouds, seeking help from above, soft rays of light descending.

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God...” (1 Peter 3:18)

“I am the vine, ye are the branches... for without Me ye can do nothing.” (John 15:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing near a vineyard, gesturing toward the lush vines and branches.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: The bridge between a sinful human and a holy God is Jesus Christ. He does not merely help us improve; He is the vital source of life. Just as a branch dies if cut from the vine, we have no spiritual power unless connected to Him.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a healthy branch grafted onto a strong, ancient vine, contrasting with a withered branch lying on the ground.

---

Slide 9 Insight: Spirit-led Tangent

[SN] The "Vine and Branch" imagery implies a constant, living flow of nourishment. It is not a one-time contact, but an abiding relationship where the life of Christ (the sap) flows into the believer (the branch) to produce fruit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on a cluster of grapes on the vine, capturing the sunlight filtering through the leaves, representing life and fruitfulness.

---

Slide 10 Question: What does Jesus call this radical change, and how important is it?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus speaking earnestly to a man at night, illuminated by the warm glow of a nearby oil lamp.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Nicodemus leaning forward in the shadows, his face expressing deep contemplation and surprise at Jesus' words.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Jesus uses the term "born again" (or born from above). This indicates that the Christian life is not a modification of the old life, but the beginning of an entirely new existence.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fresh green sprout breaking through the dry earth at dawn, symbolizing new life beginning.

---

Slide 13 Historical Context: Nicodemus

[DYK] Nicodemus, to whom Jesus spoke these words, was a religious leader and a strict commandment-keeper. Yet, Jesus told him that religious practice was not enough—he needed a new heart and a new spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Pharisee in elaborate robes studying a scroll, looking pensive, suggesting that knowledge alone is insufficient.

---

Slide 14 Question: How is this new birth accomplished?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of wheat stalks bending gracefully in a field under the influence of an unseen wind.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.” (1 Peter 1:23)

“The wind bloweth where it listeth... so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.” (John 3:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open scroll on a table, the pages fluttering slightly as if by a mysterious breeze.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The agent of the new birth is the Holy Spirit working through the Word of God. We may not always understand the exact process—just as we cannot see the wind, only its effects—but when the Word is received into the heart, the Spirit brings new life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of trees on a hillside bowing to the wind, depicting the invisible but powerful movement of the Spirit.

---

Slide 17 Question: What is the visible evidence that a person has been born again?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large basket filled with various ripe fruits, sitting in a sunlit garden.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Galatians 5:22-23)

“If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of Him.” (1 John 2:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of early Christians breaking bread together, their faces radiating peace and kindness.

Slide 19 Progressive Disclosure: Evidence of New Life

*   A change in desires (Works of flesh vs. Fruit of Spirit)
*   A love for righteousness
*   Victory over the world
*   Love for the brethren

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man turning away from a dark, crowded street to walk up a quiet, light-filled path.

---

Slide 20 Term Definition: Righteousness

“Righteousness” in Scripture is defined as conformity to God’s law. Psalm 119:172 says, “all thy commandments are righteousness.” Therefore, the new birth results in a heart that naturally loves and obeys God’s law, not to earn salvation, but as a fruit of the Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of stone tablets bathed in a soft, inviting light, signifying the law written on the heart rather than cold stone.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: The Contrast of Laws

[SN] Romans 8:2 speaks of the "law of the Spirit of life" freeing us from the "law of sin and death." This does not mean the Ten Commandments are abolished. Rather, the "law of sin" (our selfish nature) is overcome by a higher power (the Spirit), enabling us to fulfill the righteous requirement of God's moral law.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bird flying freely out of an open cage, representing the spirit of life overcoming the law of captivity.

---

Slide 22 Question: What happens to the old life of condemnation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man standing at a crossroads, leaving a heavy, dark burden behind him on the ground.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” (Romans 8:1)

“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure emerging from a dark cave into a brilliant, golden sunrise.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: When born again, the believer passes from death to life. The guilt of the past is washed away, and a new power is given to live victoriously. The struggle between flesh and Spirit may continue, but the "new creature" is no longer a slave to sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of chains lying broken on a stone floor, illuminated by a shaft of light from a high window.

---

Slide 25 Deeper Insight: Victory Through Faith

The victory described in 1 John 5:4 ("this is the victory... even our faith") suggests that overcoming the world is not achieved by human effort, but by maintaining our faith connection to the Conqueror, Jesus Christ.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer holding onto the hem of Jesus’ garment, symbolizing faith as the connection to power.

---

Slide 26 Practical Application

*   Acknowledge our inability to change our own hearts.
*   Invite the Holy Spirit to apply the Word to our lives.
*   "Reckon" (consider) ourselves dead to sin and alive to God (Romans 6:11).
*   Look for the fruit: Are we growing in patience, love, and obedience?
