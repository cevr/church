Study Title: The Lord's Day: Christ and the Sabbath

Question: Who was the active agent in the creation of the world?

Biblical Answer: “...God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.” (Ephesians 3:9)

Explanation: The New Testament clarifies that Jesus Christ was the active agent of Creation. The Father created all things *through* the Son. Therefore, when we read Genesis, we are seeing the handiwork of Jesus.

[SN] Spirit‑led tangent: This aligns with John 1:1-3, describing Jesus as the "Word." Just as a spoken word reveals a thought, Jesus reveals the creative power of the Father. "Without Him was not anything made that was made."

Question: What did the Creator do immediately after finishing the creation of the world?

Biblical Answer: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it...” (Genesis 2:2, 3)

Explanation: Because Jesus is the Creator, it was Jesus who rested on the first seventh day. He performed three distinct acts on this day:
1. He **rested**.
2. He **blessed** it.
3. He **sanctified** it.

Term Definition: **Sanctified** means "to set apart for a holy use." It is distinct from the other six working days.

[DYK] The day, month, and year correspond to the movements of the earth, moon, and sun. However, the seven-day week has no astronomical basis; it exists solely because God established it at Creation.

Question: Who does Jesus say acts as the "Lord" or owner of the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)

Explanation: Jesus claims ownership of the day. He does not say the Sabbath is the "Lord's day" of the Jews only; He says the Sabbath was made for "man" (humanity) and that He is its Lord.

[ILL] If an architect designs a building, he knows its purpose better than anyone else. Because Christ (the Architect) built the world and established the Sabbath, He is the one who defines how it should be kept.

Question: Did Jesus keep the Sabbath while He lived on earth?

Biblical Answer: “And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.” (Luke 4:16)

Explanation: It was the "custom" or habit of Jesus to worship on the Sabbath. He affirmed that He kept His Father's commandments (John 15:10).

Question: Did the Sabbath command end at the Cross, or did His followers continue to observe it?

Biblical Answer: “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.” (Luke 23:56)

Explanation: Even in the crisis of Jesus' death, His closest followers respected the commandment. They prepared spices on Friday (the preparation day), rested on the Sabbath (Saturday), and went to the tomb on the first day of the week (Sunday) to do their work.

Progressive Disclosure: • Christ kept it in life • Christ rested in the tomb on the Sabbath • The disciples kept it after His death • Paul kept it in his ministry (Acts 17:2)

[SN] Deeper Insight: Consider the "Magna Charta" of the Christian faith mentioned in Ephesians 2:20—the church is built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Jesus as the cornerstone. Both the prophets (Old Testament) and apostles (New Testament) upheld the Sabbath, united by the Cornerstone, Jesus.

Question: Which day is the "Lord's Day" mentioned in the book of Revelation?

Biblical Answer: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day...” (Revelation 1:10)

Explanation: John mentions the "Lord's day" but does not define it in that specific verse. However, looking at the rest of Scripture, there is only one day the Lord calls His own: "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the **Lord** thy God" (Exodus 20:10) and Jesus is " **Lord** of the Sabbath" (Mark 2:28).

Logic of Scripture:
1. The Sabbath is the Lord's Day (Exodus 20:10, Isaiah 58:13).
2. Jesus is the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28).
3. Therefore, the "Lord's Day" John speaks of is the Sabbath.

[ILL] If a King declares, "This province belongs to me," and later refers to "The King's Province," his subjects know exactly which territory he is speaking of without him needing to draw a new map.

Question: Is the Law of God subject to change?

Biblical Answer: “All His commandments are sure. They stand fast forever and ever...” (Psalm 111:7, 8) and “It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.” (Luke 16:17)

Explanation: The moral law reflects God's character, which does not change. Jesus came to "magnify the law" (Isaiah 42:21), showing its spiritual depth, not to abolish it.

Practical Application: How does the Lord's Day affect us today?
• It provides a weekly reminder of our Creator.
• It allows us to rest in the finished work of Jesus.
• It is a day of "doing well" (Matt 12:12) and spiritual refreshing.
God invites us to enter into the rest that He established for us at the very beginning.
