Study Title: The Creator is Our Redeemer

Question: What distinguishes the true God from all false gods in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth... The portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things... The Lord of hosts is His name.” (Jeremiah 10:11-16)

Explanation: The Bible draws a sharp contrast. A false god is anything worshipped that did not originate life. The true God is identified specifically as the "Former of all things." His authority to rule is rooted in His power to create.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, gods were often associated with forces of nature (sun, storm, fertility). The Bible is unique in claiming its God is outside of nature and created it entirely from nothing.

Question: Who was the active agent in the Creation of the world?

Biblical Answer: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1:1-3)

Explanation: The "Word" refers to Jesus Christ (see John 1:14). It was not a distant act; God created the world *through* Jesus. The Saviour who died on the cross is the same Person who spoke the universe into existence.

Question: How does the Bible link God’s power to create with His power to save us?

Biblical Answer: “But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.” (Isaiah 43:1)

Progressive Disclosure: • Creation • Formation • Redemption • Ownership.
Because He made us, He claims the right to save us. Redemption is not merely a legal transaction; it is a restoration of ownership by the Maker.

[ILL] If a watch is broken, you do not take it to a carpenter; you take it to the watchmaker. Only the one who designed the mechanism knows how to perfectly restore it. Likewise, only our Creator can fix the brokenness of the human heart.

Question: Does the Bible describe salvation as a creative act?

Biblical Answer: “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” (Psalm 51:10)

Explanation: King David, seeking forgiveness after a terrible sin, used the word "create." He understood that he didn't just need improvement; he needed a brand-new heart. Salvation is the power of creation applied to the soul.

Term Definition: "Workmanship" — In Ephesians 2:10 (“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus...”), the Greek word is *poiema*, from which we get "poem." You are God’s work of art, being re-sculpted by Jesus.

Question: If God has the power to hold the stars in place, what can He do for us?

Biblical Answer: “Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things... not one faileth.” (Isaiah 40:26) ... “Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.” (Jude 24)

Explanation: The same invisible energy that keeps the planets in orbit and the stars from colliding is available to the believer. This power keeps us from "falling" into sin. God does not wind up the universe and walk away; He sustains it moment by moment (Colossians 1:17). He sustains our spiritual life in the same way.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: Early Adventist pioneers viewed the "laws of nature" and the "moral law" as originating from the same Lawgiver. To them, a violation of physical law (health) or moral law (Commandments) was a violation of the Creator's design. The power to obey both comes from the Creator Himself.

Question: What sign did God give to remind us that He is both our Creator and our Sanctifier (Redeemer)?

Biblical Answer: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11). “Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)

Explanation: The Sabbath serves a dual purpose. It looks back to the beginning, reminding us we are created beings. It also looks inward, reminding us that we cannot make ourselves holy—only the Creator can sanctify us. Resting on the Sabbath is an act of faith, acknowledging that we rely on God's work, not our own, for both life and salvation.

Deeper Insight: The denial of a literal Creation (such as through the theory of evolution) often leads to a denial of the Gospel. If man is rising upward from a primal state through his own effort and death, he needs no Redeemer. If man fell from a perfect creation into sin, he requires a Creator to restore him. The Gospel is "Creation Regained."

Practical Application: Where do you feel "broken" or unable to change yourself today?
• A habit you can't break
• A temper you can't control
• A past you can't heal
The One who spoke light into darkness says, "I make all things new." You can ask Him to *create* a new spirit within you right now.
