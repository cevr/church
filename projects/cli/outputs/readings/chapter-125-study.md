Study Title: Trusting in Jesus

Question: What did the ancient prophets predict regarding Christ and the nations?

Biblical Answer: “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles trust.” (Isaiah 11:10; see also Romans 15:12)

Explanation: The prophet Isaiah foresaw a time when the Messiah (the "root of Jesse," referring to David’s father) would not be a local hero only, but a rallying point for all nations. Trusting in Jesus is the universal call of Scripture, extending beyond national borders to the "Gentiles"—that is, to everyone.

Term Definition: “Ensign” refers to a banner, flag, or standard raised on a hill during battle or gathering. It signals a place of safety and assembly. Jesus is the banner to whom the world rallies for salvation.

[DYK] In Hebrew genealogy, a "root" springing up often implies new life coming from a cut-down tree. Though the royal line of David had lost its earthly power, Jesus emerged as the living Root to restore true spiritual authority.

Question: What is the sequence of events that leads a person to be "sealed" by God?

Biblical Answer: “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.” (Ephesians 1:13)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Hearing**: Faith comes by hearing the Word of truth.
2.  **Trusting**: Placing confidence in the Gospel message.
3.  **Sealing**: God marks the believer with the Holy Spirit as His own.

[ILL] Think of a seal on an official document or a royal letter. It signifies three things: Ownership (this belongs to the King), Authenticity (this is genuine), and Security (this is protected until the day of delivery). When we trust Jesus, the Holy Spirit marks us as God’s authentic property.

Question: How does the Bible describe the Christian’s ability to conquer the challenges of this world?

Biblical Answer: “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” (1 John 5:4)

Explanation: Victory is not achieved by human willpower or physical strength, but through a "birth" from God that results in faith. To "overcome the world" means to rise above its sinful customs, its doubts, and its distractions by keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus.

[SN] Connection to the Great Controversy: In Revelation 12:11, the saints overcome the accuser "by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony." Victory is a partnership: Christ provides the merit (the Blood), and we provide the trust and confession (the Testimony). This aligns with the pioneer view that faith is an active, overcoming principle, not just a passive assent.

Question: What happens if a believer stops trusting and retreats from their faith?

Biblical Answer: “Now the just shall live by faith; but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.” (Hebrews 10:38)

Explanation: The Christian life is a walk, a forward motion. God takes no pleasure in "drawing back" because it signifies a loss of confidence in His ability to save and sustain. "Living by faith" means a daily, continuous reliance on God, regardless of feelings or circumstances.

Question: Does trusting in Jesus bring peace even when life is difficult?

Biblical Answer: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33)

Deeper Insight: Jesus does not promise the absence of trouble ("tribulation"), but He promises the presence of peace *within* the trouble. Because He has already conquered the world, our trust in Him allows us to share in His victory.

Question: Can trusting in Jesus impact our physical well-being and daily life?

Biblical Answer: “For she said within herself, If I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned Him about, and when He saw her, He said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole...” (Matthew 9:21-22)

Explanation: This woman had exhausted all human resources. Her "touch" was an act of desperate, specific trust. Jesus clarified that it wasn't the magic of the cloth, but her *faith* in Him that facilitated the healing. Trust opens the door for God's power to work in our lives, physically and spiritually.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, the hem or corner of a man's garment (the *tzitzit*) represented his authority and identity. By touching the hem, the woman was laying claim to the authority and promises of the Messiah.

Practical Application:
*   **Identify**: Where do I need peace today? (John 16:33)
*   **Action**: Am I "drawing back" in fear, or moving forward in faith? (Heb 10:38)
*   **Testimony**: How can my trust in God become a "word of testimony" to help others? (Rev 12:11)
