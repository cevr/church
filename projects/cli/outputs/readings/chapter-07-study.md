Study Title: Unlocking Prophecy: The Messiah and the Sanctuary

Question: How does the Bible reveal the history of nations through prophecy?

Biblical Answer: “These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.” (Daniel 7:17; see also Daniel 8:20-22)

Explanation: The text outlines a succession of world empires represented by beasts in Daniel 7 and 8.
*   **Babylon** (605-538 B.C.)
*   **Medo-Persia** (538-334 B.C.) represented by the bear and the ram.
*   **Grecia** (334-168 B.C.) represented by the leopard and the he-goat.
*   **Pagan Rome** (168 B.C. – 5th Century A.D.) represented by the terrible beast.

[DYK] Alexander the Great, represented by the "notable horn" of the goat, conquered the known world in just ten years. Yet, as prophecy predicted, he was "broken off" in his prime (died at age 32), and his empire was divided among his four generals.

Question: What power arises after the Roman Empire, and what is its character?

Biblical Answer: “He shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws.” (Daniel 7:25)

Explanation: Emerging from the fragments of the Roman Empire, the "little horn" represents Papal Rome. The text notes that this power would seek to uproot earthly kingdoms, speak blasphemies, persecute God’s people, and attempt to alter God’s law.

Term Definition: **Blasphemy** in this prophetic context refers to a human power claiming the prerogatives of God, such as the power to forgive sins or change divine law.

Question: What is the longest time prophecy in the Bible, and when does it end?

Biblical Answer: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

Explanation: This is the 2300-day prophecy. In Bible prophecy, a day equals a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). This vast period concludes with the cleansing of the sanctuary.

[ILL] Imagine a long measuring tape representing 2300 years. To know where it ends, you must know where it begins. Prophecy provides a specific starting event—a "stake in the ground"—to anchor the timeline.

Question: When does this 2300-year prophecy begin?

Biblical Answer: “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks...” (Daniel 9:25)

Explanation: The starting point is the decree of Artaxerxes to restore Jewish government in **457 B.C.**
*   From 457 B.C., the timeline extends 2300 years forward.
*   This brings us to **1844 A.D.**

[SN] The angel Gabriel explains the vision in Daniel 9 because Daniel 8 ends with the prophet not understanding the "time" aspect. The connection between the two chapters is vital: Daniel 9 provides the key (the starting date) to unlock the lock (the duration) of Daniel 8.

Question: What specific portion of this time was allotted to the Jewish people and the coming of the Messiah?

Biblical Answer: “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city...” (Daniel 9:24)

Explanation: The word "determined" in Hebrew literally means "cut off." The first 70 weeks (490 years) of the longer 2300-year prophecy were cut off specifically for the Jewish nation.
*   **483 Years (69 weeks):** Reaches to 27 A.D., the anointing of Christ (Baptism).
*   **The Final Week:** In the midst of the week (31 A.D.), the Messiah is "cut off" (Crucifixion), causing the sacrifice and oblation to cease.
*   **End of 70 Weeks:** The period ends in 34 A.D. with the stoning of Stephen, marking the gospel going to the Gentiles.

Deeper Insight: The accuracy of this prophecy confirms Jesus is the Messiah. He appeared exactly when the timeline predicted. If the first part of the prophecy (the arrival of Jesus) is true, the second part (the cleansing of the sanctuary in 1844) must also be true.

Question: What began in 1844 at the end of the 2300 days?

Biblical Answer: [Referencing Daniel 8:14] “...then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.”

Explanation: In 1844, the 2300 years ended. This marked the beginning of the "cleansing of the sanctuary." Since the earthly sanctuary was destroyed long ago, this refers to the Heavenly Sanctuary. Jesus, our High Priest, began His final work of judgment and intercession, preparing to claim His people before His Second Coming.

Practical Application: We are living in the time of the "cleansing of the sanctuary," a time of judgment but also of hope. Just as God’s timetable for the first coming of Jesus was perfect, His timetable for the conclusion of history is precise. We can trust the Guide who knows the end from the beginning.
