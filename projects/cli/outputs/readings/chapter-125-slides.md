Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles trust.” (Isaiah 11:10; see also Romans 15:12)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Isaiah foresaw a time when the Messiah would not be a local hero only, but a rallying point for all nations. Trusting in Jesus is the universal call of Scripture, extending beyond national borders to the "Gentiles"—that is, to everyone.

Slide 4 Term Definition: “Ensign” refers to a banner, flag, or standard raised on a hill during battle or gathering. It signals a place of safety and assembly. Jesus is the banner to whom the world rallies for salvation.

Slide 5 Did You Know? In Hebrew genealogy, a "root" springing up often implies new life coming from a cut-down tree. Though the royal line of David had lost its earthly power, Jesus emerged as the living Root to restore true spiritual authority.

Slide 6 Question: What is the sequence of events that leads a person to be "sealed" by God?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise.” (Ephesians 1:13)

Slide 8 Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Hearing**: Faith comes by hearing the Word of truth.
2.  **Trusting**: Placing confidence in the Gospel message.
3.  **Sealing**: God marks the believer with the Holy Spirit as His own.

Slide 9 Illustration: Think of a seal on an official document. It signifies three things:
1.  **Ownership**: This belongs to the King.
2.  **Authenticity**: This is genuine.
3.  **Security**: This is protected until delivery.
When we trust Jesus, the Holy Spirit marks us as God’s authentic property.

Slide 10 Question: How does the Bible describe the Christian’s ability to conquer the challenges of this world?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” (1 John 5:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer looking upward with a shield of faith, light breaking through dark clouds.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Victory is not achieved by human willpower or physical strength, but through a "birth" from God that results in faith. To "overcome the world" means to rise above its sinful customs, doubts, and distractions by keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man turning away from a chaotic marketplace to look toward a peaceful light on the horizon.

---

Slide 13 Insight: Victory is a partnership. As seen in Revelation 12:11, the saints overcome "by the blood of the Lamb" (Christ's merit) and "the word of their testimony" (our trust and confession). Faith is an active, overcoming principle.

[SN] This aligns with the pioneer view that faith is not just passive assent, but an active power that claims Christ's victory.

Slide 14 Question: What happens if a believer stops trusting and retreats from their faith?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a path winding through hills, with a figure pausing and looking backward with hesitation.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Now the just shall live by faith; but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him.” (Hebrews 10:38)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pilgrim walking resolutely forward on a dusty road, eyes set on the destination.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The Christian life is a walk, a forward motion. God takes no pleasure in "drawing back" because it signifies a loss of confidence in His ability to save. "Living by faith" means a daily, continuous reliance on God.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of footprints on a path leading toward a sunrise, symbolizing continuous forward motion.

Slide 17 Question: Does trusting in Jesus bring peace even when life is difficult?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small boat on a rough sea, but with a calm, glowing presence in the center.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching his disciples in an intimate setting, his expression radiating calm and authority.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: Jesus does not promise the absence of trouble ("tribulation"), but He promises the presence of peace *within* the trouble. Because He has already conquered the world, our trust in Him allows us to share in His victory.

Slide 20 Question: Can trusting in Jesus impact our physical well-being and daily life?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large, crowded street scene in ancient Israel, focusing on a woman reaching out through the crowd.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “For she said within herself, If I may but touch His garment, I shall be whole. But Jesus turned Him about, and when He saw her, He said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole...” (Matthew 9:21-22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a hand reaching out to touch the hem of a simple woven robe, highlighting the texture and the moment of contact.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: This woman had exhausted all human resources. Her "touch" was an act of desperate, specific trust. Jesus clarified that it wasn't the magic of the cloth, but her *faith* in Him that facilitated the healing.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus helping a woman to her feet, looking at her with compassion and validation.

---

Slide 23 Did You Know? In the ancient Near East, the hem or corner of a man's garment (the *tzitzit*) represented his authority and identity. By touching the hem, the woman was laying claim to the authority and promises of the Messiah.

Slide 24 Practical Application:
*   **Identify**: Where do I need peace today?
*   **Action**: Am I "drawing back" in fear, or moving forward in faith?
*   **Testimony**: How can my trust in God become a "word of testimony" to help others?
