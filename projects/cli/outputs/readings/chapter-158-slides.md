Slide 3 Explanation: It is easy to credit success to our own intelligence or hard work. However, Scripture teaches that the energy, health, and mental capacity required to work are gifts from God. We are not independent owners, but stewards.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, prosperity was often attributed to local deities or personal strength. Deuteronomy 8 served as a radical reminder that prosperity is entirely dependent on Yahweh, the Creator.

Slide 4 Question: What caution does the Bible give when our wealth begins to grow?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.” (Psalm 62:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man turning his gaze away from a chest of gold to look toward a light in the distance.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The danger is not the riches themselves, but the position they occupy in our hearts. As wealth grows, the human tendency is to feel self-sufficient, displacing trust in God with trust in accumulated resources.

Slide 7 Illustration: The Dead Sea vs. The Sea of Galilee.
The Dead Sea takes water in but gives nothing out; it is stagnant and lifeless. The Sea of Galilee receives and flows out, teeming with life. Wealth hoarded stagnates the soul; wealth that flows in service brings life.

Slide 8 Question: What are the specific dangers of pursuing wealth as a primary goal?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.” (1 Tim. 6:9)

---

Slide 10 Term Definition: "Snare."
This word refers to a trap used to catch animals. The pursuit of money promises freedom but often leads to bondage—fear of loss, compromised principles, and distraction from spiritual reality.

[SN] Note on the "Rich Young Ruler" (Matt 19): Jesus’ command to sell everything was specific to this man because money was his idol. The "sore evil" is when wealth possesses the possessor.

Slide 11 Question: How should those who have resources behave?

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come...” (1 Tim. 6:18-19)

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The remedy for the snare of riches is generosity. Being "ready to distribute" means keeping a loose grip on earthly assets so they can be moved quickly to help others, transforming temporary currency into eternal treasure.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a treasure chest being emptied, but the contents turning into light as they touch the ground.

Slide 14 Question: What does the Bible say about the security wealth provides in the final judgment?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king standing before a divine throne, his crown and scepter lying useless on the floor.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath.” (Zeph. 1:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of gold coins scattered in the dust of a ruined city, ignored by passersby.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Material wealth is strictly limited to this life. To prepare for a long life on earth while remaining "not rich toward God" is to make provision for the body while starving the soul.

[SN] Historical Insight: In the 1840s, early Advent believers sold fields and crops to fund the message of Christ's coming. They esteemed the "reproach of Christ" greater than earthly treasure.

Slide 17 Question: How does God define someone who is truly "rich"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a humble family praying over a simple meal, their faces radiating joy and peace.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him?” (James 2:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a poor shepherd looking up at the stars, seeing a vision of a celestial kingdom.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: True wealth is measured by faith and inheritance in God's kingdom. "The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it" (Prov 10:22). God’s wealth brings peace; worldly wealth often brings anxiety.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: The "eternal inheritance" mentioned in Isaiah 64:4 suggests rewards beyond human comprehension. We trade the temporary, rusting dust of this earth for the imperishable glory of God's presence.

---

Slide 21 Practical Application: How do we handle our resources today?
1. **Acknowledge Source:** Thank God for the ability to work.
2. **Check the Heart:** Do I own my things, or do they own me?
3. **Practice Generosity:** Be ready to distribute.
4. **Prioritize:** Seek to be "rich in faith" above all else.
