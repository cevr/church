Study Title: The Eternal Law: Moral Obligation Before Sinai

Question: Can sin exist without a law?

Biblical Answer: “Because the law worketh wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression.” (Romans 4:15)

Explanation: The Bible defines sin as the transgression (breaking) of the law (1 John 3:4). Therefore, if the Bible records sin existing before the Ten Commandments were given at Mount Sinai, it implies that God’s moral law was already in force.

Question: How early in history did sin and the violation of God’s law begin?

Biblical Answer: “He that committeth sin is of the Devil; for the Devil sinneth from the beginning.” (1 John 3:8) “God spared not the angels that sinned...” (2 Peter 2:4)

Progressive Disclosure:
• Sin began with Lucifer (the Devil) before humanity existed.
• Angels were held accountable for sin.
• Therefore, the standard of God's government (His Law) existed in heaven before it was written on stone on earth.

[ILL] Consider the law of gravity. It existed and functioned long before Isaac Newton wrote down the mathematical formula. Similarly, God's moral law existed and governed the universe long before Moses wrote it on tablets of stone.

Question: Did the first generations of humans know the difference between right and wrong?

Biblical Answer: “If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door... And he [God] said... the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.” (Genesis 4:7-10)

Explanation: In the story of Cain and Abel, God warns Cain that "sin lies at the door." When Cain murdered his brother, God held him accountable. Cain could not be guilty of sin if there was no law against murder.

Term Definition: **Patriarchal Age**: The period of biblical history from Creation until the giving of the Law at Sinai (covering Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob). This study demonstrates that moral obligation was binding during this entire era.

Question: By what standard were the people before the Flood and in Sodom judged?

Biblical Answer: [Regarding Noah] “And spared not the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness.” (2 Peter 2:5)
[Regarding Lot in Sodom] “And delivered just Lot... for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds.” (2 Peter 2:7, 8)

Deeper Insight: Lot was vexed by "unlawful" deeds. You cannot have an "unlawful" deed unless there is a law. Furthermore, Noah preached "righteousness" (right-doing), which presupposes a standard of right and wrong.

[DYK] The word "righteousness" in the Bible essentially means "acting in accordance with a standard." In a biblical context, that standard is always the character and will of God, expressed in His law.

Question: Did the patriarchs specifically know and keep God’s commandments?

Biblical Answer: “Because that Abraham obeyed My voice, and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes and My laws.” (Genesis 26:5)

Explanation: This is one of the most powerful verses regarding the pre-Sinai law. Centuries before Moses, God commends Abraham for keeping His "commandments, statutes, and laws."

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent: The Great Controversy Context**
The fact that Abraham kept God's "statutes" suggests a revealed system of worship and morality passed down from Adam. This connects to the broader "Great Controversy" theme—Satan's claim is often that God's law cannot be kept. Abraham's life (the father of the faithful) stands as a witness that through faith, humanity could walk in harmony with God's eternal law.

Question: How did Joseph react when tempted to commit adultery in Egypt?

Biblical Answer: “How then, can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?” (Genesis 39:9)

Explanation: Joseph, living in a pagan culture without a written Bible, knew that adultery was not just a social error, but a "great wickedness" and a "sin against God." The moral law was written on his conscience and revered in his life.

Question: Who are the true heirs of this faith today?

Biblical Answer: “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:29) “If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.” (John 8:39)

Practical Application:
• God’s Law is not merely Jewish; it is eternal and universal.
• Like Abraham, we are saved by faith, and that faith leads us to obey God’s voice.
• Like Joseph, we should recognize sin as an offense against God, regardless of the culture around us.

Final Thought: The moral law is an expression of God’s character. Since God does not change, His moral requirements remain the same from the beginning of the world to the end.
