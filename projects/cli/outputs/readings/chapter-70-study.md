Study Title: The Eternal Nature of God’s Law

Question: According to Scripture, what is the standard by which all humanity will be judged?

Biblical Answer: “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ... So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” (2 Corinthians 5:10; James 2:12)

Explanation: Every person will face judgment. The standard used in this judgment is God’s law. Interestingly, James calls it the "law of liberty." While the world often views God’s law as restrictive, the Bible teaches that true freedom is found in living within the design God created for us, free from the slavery of sin.

[DYK] The phrase "law of liberty" suggests that obedience to God is not forced servitude but the free choice of a loving heart. Just as a train is free only when it stays on the tracks, humanity is free only when aligned with moral law.

Question: What is the spiritual condition of humanity in relation to this law?

Biblical Answer: “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:19, 23)

Explanation: The law acts as a diagnostic tool. It silences our excuses ("every mouth stopped") and reveals our guilt. Whether Jew or Gentile, religious or secular, all have fallen short of God's glory.

[ILL] An X-ray machine can reveal a broken bone, but it cannot heal it. In the same way, the Law reveals our sin (the break in our relationship with God), but it points us to the Physician (Jesus) for the cure.

Question: Does having faith in Jesus abolish the need to keep the law?

Biblical Answer: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” (Romans 3:31)

Explanation: Paul anticipates the argument that grace removes the obligation to obey. His answer is emphatic: "God forbid." True faith does not cancel the law; it "establishes" it in the heart of the believer. Because we are saved by grace, we desire to live in harmony with the God who saved us.

Term Definition: "Make void" (Greek: *katargeō*) means to render idle, useless, or to abolish. Paul argues that faith makes the law effective and active in our lives, not useless.

Question: How long did Jesus say the law would remain in force?

Biblical Answer: “For verily I say into you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:18)

Explanation: Jesus affirms the absolute permanence of the law. As long as the physical heaven and earth exist, the moral law remains binding.

[DYK] A "jot" refers to *yod*, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet (resembling an apostrophe). A "tittle" is a tiny stroke or decorative horn that distinguishes one Hebrew letter from another. Jesus was saying that not even the smallest stroke of a letter in God's law would disappear.

Question: How is the law summarized?

Biblical Answer: “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart... And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40)

Explanation: The Ten Commandments are split into two sections: duty to God (first four) and duty to man (last six). Jesus teaches that "love" is not a replacement for the law, but the foundation of it. You cannot truly love God while worshipping idols; you cannot truly love your neighbor while stealing from him.

[ILL] Think of a door hanging on two hinges. The door represents the specific commandments, and the hinges represent the two principles of love. If you remove the hinges, the door falls. If you have hinges but no door, they serve no practical purpose. Love and Law are inseparable.

Question: What is the surest evidence that a person truly knows and loves God?

Biblical Answer: “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him... For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.” (1 John 2:4; 1 John 5:3)

Explanation: Profession is not enough. The Apostle John, often called the "disciple of love," links knowing God directly with obeying Him. Obedience is the fruit of love.

Deeper Insight: Romans 8:7 tells us that the "carnal mind" (the unconverted nature) is hostile to God and *cannot* be subject to His law. Therefore, keeping the commandments is supernatural proof that a person has been born again and possesses the "mind of Christ."

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the description of the "Remnant" church in Revelation 12:17. In the last days, the defining characteristic of God’s people is that they "keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus." This suggests a restoration of the Law in the life of the church before Christ returns.

Practical Application:
• **Review your path:** Does your life reflect the "law of liberty"?
• **Check your motive:** Do you obey out of fear, or because you love the One who first loved you?
• **Abide in Him:** 1 John 2:6 says if we abide in Him, we will walk as He walked. Jesus kept His Father's commandments; to be like Jesus is to do the same.
