Study Title: Prophecy and the Authority of God’s Law

Question: What specific actions did the prophet Daniel predict a confusing earthly power would take against God?

Biblical Answer: “And he shall speak great words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High, and think to change times and laws.” (Daniel 7:25)

Explanation: The prophecy describes a power often referred to as the "little horn." This entity is not merely political but religious, as it directs its actions against the "Most High." The most startling prediction is that this power would intend to change God's "times and laws."

Term Definition: **"Think to change"**: The original language implies an *attempted* change. Because God’s moral law is eternal and immutable (unchangeable), a human power cannot actually alter it in heaven, but they can attempt to alter it in the minds and practices of people on earth.

[DYK] The Ten Commandments (God's Law) contain only one commandment dealing with "time"—the fourth commandment regarding the Sabbath. Therefore, a power seeking to change "times and laws" would logically attack the Sabbath.

Question: How does the Apostle Paul describe this same power in the New Testament?

Biblical Answer: “Except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition; who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped.” (2 Thessalonians 2:3, 4)

Explanation: Paul warns of a "falling away" (apostasy) from within the church, not just an attack from without. He describes a "man of sin" who seeks a position of authority superior to God Himself.

[ILL] Imagine a governor and a king. If a governor creates new minor local laws, he acts alongside the king. But if the governor attempts to *erase* or *rewrite* the fundamental laws established by the king, he is effectively claiming to be higher than the king. To change the Lawgiver's law is to claim the Lawgiver's throne.

Question: According to history and its own admissions, has any power claimed the authority to change biblical laws?

Biblical Answer: [Source Text Reference] “Had she not such power, she could not have done that in which all modern religionists agree with her, she could not have substituted the observance of Sunday, the first day of the week, for the observance of Saturday, the seventh day, a change for which there is not scriptural authority.” (*Doctrinal Catechism*, p. 174)

Explanation: The source text identifies the Papacy as the power that fulfills this prophecy. The admission is clear: the shift from the biblical Sabbath (Saturday) to Sunday rests not on Scripture, but on church authority.

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **The Law**: God commanded the seventh day.
2.  **The Change**: History shows a shift to the first day (Sunday).
3.  **The Authority**: The church claims the power to institute this change.
4.  **The Issue**: This act places church tradition above biblical command.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion:
*   **The Protestant Dilemma**: Discuss how the Protestant motto is *Sola Scriptura* (Scripture Alone), yet many Protestant churches follow the Catholic calendar regarding Sunday, which the Catechism notes is an act of acknowledging the Church's power to ordain feasts.
*   **Daniel 7 Parallels**: The "little horn" arises out of the fourth beast (Rome). Historically, as the pagan Roman Empire fell, the Papal Roman power rose, fitting the timeline of the prophecy.
*   **The Nature of Worship**: True worship is based on obedience to the Creator. The Sabbath is the memorial of Creation; changing it obscures the Creator.

Practical Application: Why is this relevant to my walk with God?
*   **Authority**: It forces us to ask, "Is the Bible my sole authority, or do I follow tradition?"
*   **Loyalty**: Keeping the Sabbath is a sign of allegiance to the Creator, rather than earthly powers.
*   **Truth**: God wants us to worship Him "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24). Understanding these prophecies helps us identify truth amidst historical changes.
