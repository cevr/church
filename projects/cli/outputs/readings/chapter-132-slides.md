Slide 3 Explanation: God places pride in the same category as evil. While the world often celebrates self-assertion, Scripture reveals that the "fear of the Lord" (reverence and awe) cannot coexist with a proud heart.

Slide 4 Definitions & Context:
*   **Froward:** An older term meaning perverse or habitually disobedient; a mouth that speaks twisted things rather than plain truth.
*   **Historical Context:** Ancient rulers demanded worship and boasted on monuments. God is unique; He rejects human boasting and values a quiet spirit.

Slide 5 Question: How does pride affect a person's perception of reality?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high: that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?” (Obadiah 3)

Slide 7 Explanation: Pride acts as a blinder. It deceives us into thinking we are secure, independent, and untouchable. The text describes someone living "high up," feeling safe from danger, yet this security is a false illusion.

[ILL] Imagine a man standing on a high cliff looking down at others. He feels powerful because of his elevation, but one slip can lead to tragedy. Pride creates a false sense of altitude; humility keeps our feet on the solid ground of reality.

Slide 8 Question: How did Jesus correct His disciples’ view of status and greatness?

Slide 10 Explanation: The Kingdom of Heaven operates on principles opposite to the world. In human society, greatness is measured by how many people serve you. In God's Kingdom, greatness is measured by how many people you serve.

Slide 11 Deeper Insight: The Great Reversal
*   **Lucifer:** Desired to be "like the Most High" by ascending (Isaiah 14).
*   **Christ:** Though equal with God, "emptied Himself" by descending to serve (Philippians 2).

[SN] The path of the Savior is always downward into service, not upward into prestige.

Slide 12 Question: What specific illustration did Jesus use to define true humility?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in a crowd, looking down with a smile and beckoning a small child to come closer.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of them, and said... Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 18:2, 3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small child standing in the center of a circle of bearded men, looking up trustingly.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Jesus points to a child because of their dependence, not just their innocence. A young child trusts their parents for food, shelter, and guidance. Greatness is realizing our total dependence on God.

Slide 15 Question: Where does the High and Holy God choose to dwell?

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.” (Isaiah 57:15)

Slide 17 Explanation & Definition:
*   **The Paradox:** God dwells in the highest heaven, yet is intimately present with the lowest of heart.
*   **"Contrite":** Comes from a root meaning "crushed" or "bruised." It refers to a heart broken over its own sinfulness, leaving no room for arrogance.

[DYK] The Pharisees were "highly esteemed" for religious rigor, yet God’s presence bypassed the proud leaders and went to the humble fishermen and sinners.

Slide 18 Question: What is the ultimate result of humility versus pride in the "Day of the Lord"?

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty... and he shall be brought low... and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day.” (Isaiah 2:12, 17)

Slide 20 Timeline of Grace:
1.  **Grace Now:** God "resists the proud" but "giveth grace unto the humble" (James 4:6).
2.  **Exaltation Later:** If we humble ourselves now, He will exalt us "in due time" (1 Peter 5:6).
3.  **Final Judgment:** Sin introduced pride (self before God). Redemption restores humility (God before self).

Slide 21 Practical Application:
*   **Service:** Seek the "last place"—tasks others avoid.
*   **Dependence:** Acknowledge need for God daily.
*   **Honesty:** Stop justifying appearances; God knows the heart.
*   **Submission:** Accept God's will, even when difficult.
