# Study Title: The Prophetic Symbols of Daniel 8: Empires and the Sanctuary

**Question:** Where was the prophet Daniel when he received this vision?

**Biblical Answer:** “I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.” (Daniel 8:2)

**Explanation:** Daniel transports us from Babylon to Shushan (Susa), a key city in the province of Elam. This geographical shift is significant because Shushan would become a capital of the Persian Empire, the very power depicted next in the vision.

**[DYK]** Shushan (or Susa) is the same palace setting where the story of Esther takes place later in history. It served as the winter residence for Persian kings.

**Question:** What was the first symbol shown to Daniel, and whom does it represent?

**Biblical Answer:** “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns... The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.” (Daniel 8:3, 20)

**Explanation:** We do not need to guess the meaning of the symbols; the angel Gabriel provides the interpretation within the chapter. The ram represents the Medo-Persian empire. The two horns symbolize the dual nature of this kingdom (the Medes and the Persians).

**[SN]** *Spirit-Led Tangent:* Note that the verse says one horn was higher than the other, and the higher one "came up last." Historically, the Persians rose later than the Medes but became the dominant force in the alliance. The precision of prophecy covers even the specific dynamics of political power.

**Question:** What power would defeat the Medo-Persian ram?

**Biblical Answer:** “And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.” (Daniel 8:21)

**Explanation:** The "he goat" coming from the west represents Greece. The prophecy describes this goat moving with such speed that it "touched not the ground" (verse 5). This perfectly describes the rapid military conquests of Alexander the Great, the "notable horn."

**[ILL]** Imagine a storm sweeping across a landscape. Just as a hurricane moves with unstoppable force and speed, Alexander’s armies conquered the known world in roughly a decade—a feat unmatched in ancient military history.

**Question:** What happens to the kingdom of Greece after its first king falls?

**Biblical Answer:** “Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.” (Daniel 8:22)

**Explanation:** Alexander died at the height of his power (at age 32), not in battle, but of illness. As predicted, his kingdom was not passed to a son, but was divided among his four leading generals (Cassander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy).

**Question:** What power rises after the division of Greece?

**Biblical Answer:** “Out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.” (Daniel 8:9)

**Term Definition:** "The Pleasant Land" is a biblical term for Canaan (Israel/Palestine), the center of God’s worship on earth.

**Deeper Insight:** While the Ram and Goat were "great," this Little Horn waxes "exceeding great." In historicist prophecy interpretation, this represents the rise of Rome—first in its pagan civil form, and subsequently in its papal religious form. It extends its power geographically (South and East) and spiritually.

**Question:** How does this "Little Horn" power affect the ministry of God?

**Biblical Answer:** “Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.” (Daniel 8:11)

**Explanation:** This power is not merely a political conqueror; it is a religious usurper. It attacks the "Prince of the host" (Christ) and interferes with the "daily" (the continual ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary). It substitutes human systems for God’s divine plan of salvation.

**[SN]** *Spirit-Led Tangent:* The word "daily" (Hebrew: *tamid*) refers to the continual service of the sanctuary. By casting this down, the prophecy indicates an earthly power that obscures Christ's high priestly ministry in heaven, directing the eyes of men to earthly temples and priesthoods instead.

***

**Question:** What is the solution to this casting down of the truth?

**Biblical Answer:** “He said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

**Explanation:** This is the central pillar of the chapter. Amidst the attack on God’s truth, God sets a time limit. At the end of this prophetic period (2300 days), a work of "cleansing" or restoration begins.

**[DYK]** In Bible prophecy, a day often represents a literal year (Numbers 14:34, Ezekiel 4:6). Therefore, this 2300-day period represents 2300 years of history, pointing to a time in the "time of the end" (verse 17) when God would begin the work of judgment and restoring the truth about His character and sanctuary.

**Question:** Who helps Daniel understand this vision, and how did Daniel react?

**Biblical Answer:** “...Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision... I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king's business.” (Daniel 8:16, 27)

**Explanation:** Even the prophet Daniel was overwhelmed by the scope of history and the conflict between truth and error shown to him. He needed divine assistance to understand.

**Practical Application:**
1.  **God Rules History:** Nations rise and fall (Persia, Greece, Rome), but God knows the end from the beginning.
2.  **Truth Will Triumph:** Though the truth of God's sanctuary is "cast down" for a time, God has appointed a time for it to be cleansed and vindicated.
3.  **Seek Understanding:** Like Daniel, we should seek to understand God's word, trusting that He will send His Spirit (and angels) to guide us into truth.
