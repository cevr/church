Study Title: Christ in All the Bible

Question: Whom does Jesus Himself say the Scriptures are really about?

Biblical Answer: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of Me.” (John 5:39)

Explanation: Jesus teaches that the Bible is not merely a history book or a collection of moral rules; it is a unified testimony about Himself. To understand the Old Testament properly, one must look for the Messiah on its pages.

[DYK] The word "Search" in this text implies a diligent investigation, like digging for hidden treasure. The religious leaders of Christ's day memorized the text but missed the Person the text pointed to.

Question: How much of the Bible tells us about Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)

Explanation: Jesus revealed that "all the scriptures"—from the first books written by Moses through the prophets—contain truths concerning His mission. The Old Testament is the gospel in figure and prophecy; the New Testament is the gospel in fact and fulfillment.

[ILL] Imagine a grand portrait covered by a curtain. The Old Testament prophecies are like lifting the corners of the curtain to reveal glimpses of the subject. When Jesus arrived, the curtain was fully pulled back to reveal the face that had been there all along.

Question: Where do we find the very first promise of a Saviour in the Bible?

Biblical Answer: “And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:15)

Explanation: This verse, spoken in the Garden of Eden immediately after the fall of man, is often called the *Protoevangelium* (the first gospel). It promises a "Seed" (a Descendant) who would be wounded ("bruise his heel") but would ultimately crush the power of the serpent ("bruise thy head").

Term Definition: "Seed" here refers specifically to Jesus Christ. While Abraham had many descendants, the promise of salvation centered on one specific Lineage bearer, the Messiah (see Galatians 3:16).

Question: Was Christ present with the children of Israel during their wilderness journey?

Biblical Answer: “And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” (1 Corinthians 10:4)

Explanation: The Apostle Paul clarifies that the Provider and Protector of Israel in the Exodus was none other than Christ Himself. He was the "Angel" sent before them (Exodus 23:20) and the spiritual source of their life.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This truth highlights the eternal pre-existence of Christ. He did not begin His existence at Bethlehem; His "goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting" (Micah 5:2). He has always been the active agent in the salvation of His people.

Question: How specific were the Old Testament prophecies regarding Christ’s life and betrayal?

Biblical Answer:
*   **His Birthplace:** “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah... out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be Ruler in Israel...” (Micah 5:2)
*   **His Betrayal Price:** “So they weighed for My price thirty pieces of silver.” (Zechariah 11:12)
*   **His Dying Words:** “My God, My God, why has Thou forsaken Me?” (Psalm 22:1)

Explanation: God provided specific identifying marks for the Messiah centuries before His arrival. From the exact town of His birth to the precise amount of silver paid for His betrayal, these prophecies serve as a fingerprint that only Jesus of Nazareth could match.

Question: How does the Old Testament describe the final kingdom of Christ?

Biblical Answer: “...behold, One like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven... And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom... which shall not pass away...” (Daniel 7:13-14)

Explanation: The story of Scripture does not end with the cross. The prophet Daniel was shown a vision of the judgment and the coronation of Christ. He receives an everlasting kingdom, assuring us that the plan of salvation concludes with the full restoration of God's authority.

Deeper Insight: This passage in Daniel depicts the "Son of Man" coming to the "Ancient of Days" in the heavenly courts. It describes the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, preparing to receive His kingdom before He returns to earth.

Practical Application: Why is it important to see Christ in all the Bible?
• It builds confidence that God directs history.
• It shows us that God has had a plan to save us from the very beginning (Genesis).
• It assures us that the same Jesus who guided Israel through the wilderness guides us today.
• It confirms that if the prophecies of His first coming were fulfilled exactly, the prophecies of His second coming (Psalm 50:3-4) are equally certain.
