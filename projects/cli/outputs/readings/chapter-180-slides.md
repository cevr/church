Slide 2 Biblical Answer: "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made." (Genesis 2:1, 2)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God’s original design was flawless and declared "very good" (Genesis 1:31). This was the first "finished" work of God—a perfect world designed for humanity’s happiness. Had sin not entered, this state would have continued forever.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The word "finished" implies perfection. In Hebrew, the connection between "finished" and the "seventh day" (Sabbath) highlights that the Sabbath is a memorial of a perfect, finished creation.

Slide 7 Explanation: This is the second great milestone. While Creation was finished by power, Redemption was finished by love and sacrifice. Jesus paid the complete price for sin, securing the plan to save humanity.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: Imagine a massive debt causing imprisonment. A benefactor pays the entire sum, stamping the invoice "Paid in Full." Jesus' cry of "It is finished" was the stamp on our debt of sin.

Slide 12 Term Definition: **Probation**
A period of testing or trial. In a biblical context, it is the time given to humanity to choose between God’s government of love and the rebellion of sin.

Slide 15 Explanation: The conflict is entirely over. We see a beautiful progression in Scripture:
1. Creation finished.
2. Redemption finished.
3. The reign of Sin finished.
4. The Restoration finished.

---

Slide 16 Speaker Note: Note the symmetry of "It is finished" or "It is done." It appears at history's critical junctures: The Cross (price paid), Close of Probation (mediation ended), and The New Earth (restoration complete). The Great Controversy moves from battleground to settled peace.

Slide 17 Question: What painful experiences will be permanently removed in the New Earth?

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." (Revelation 21:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a tender moment where a divine hand gently wipes a tear from a weary face, soft and comforting light.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The "former things" refers to the results of sin. Death, the "last enemy," is destroyed. The curse that affected the ground and humanity is lifted.

Slide 20 Question: How does the Bible describe the peace within the animal kingdom and nature in this new world?

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: "The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb... and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them..." (Isaiah 11:6-9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lion and a lamb lying down side by side, with a small child resting hand on the lion's mane.

Slide 22 Illustration: We are used to seeing wild animals behind bars for safety. In the New Earth, there are no cages because there is no violence. The law of love pervades all creation.

Slide 23 Question: What is the ultimate privilege for the redeemed in the New Earth?

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: "And they shall see His face... He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." (Revelation 22:4; 21:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crowd of people beholding the face of Christ with expressions of pure joy and adoration.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: This is the climax of the Gospel. Sin separated humanity from God (Isaiah 59:2), but the eradication of sin restores face-to-face communion.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a deep chasm being bridged by light, allowing people to cross over to the presence of God.

---

Slide 26 Speaker Note: In Genesis, after sin, Adam and Eve hid from the presence of the Lord. In Revelation, the redeemed "see His face." The entire Bible is the story of how God brings His children back from hiding into His embrace.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting contrasting two scenes: one of figures hiding in shadows among trees, and another of figures running into open arms of light.

Slide 27 Question: How long will God’s people enjoy this kingdom?

Slide 28 Biblical Answer: "But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever." (Daniel 7:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crown of gold resting on a rock, symbolizing a kingdom that cannot be moved or ended.

---

Slide 29 Practical Application: Since we know God has a plan to finish the work of redemption, we can endure temporary trials knowing:
1. The price is paid ("It is finished").
2. Suffering has an end date ("It is done").
3. Our future is secure forever.
