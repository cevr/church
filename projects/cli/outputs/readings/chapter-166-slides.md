Slide 2 Question: Where were the foundations of the home first laid?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Garden of Eden at dawn, mist rising from the ground, revealing a landscape of pristine beauty.

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed.” (Gen. 2:8)

Slide 4 Explanation: The home is not a human invention; it is a divine institution. God prepared the home *before* He created the family to inhabit it. It was the first school and the first church.

Slide 5 Did You Know? The word "Eden" signifies "pleasure" or "delight." God’s original design for the home was for it to be a place of supreme happiness and safety.

Slide 6 Question: In God’s perfect plan, what was needed to complete man’s happiness?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.” (Gen. 2:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Eve being presented to Adam, a divine light surrounding them, signifying the first union.

Slide 8 Definition: “Help meet” implies a helper that is suitable, adapted, or corresponding to him. It suggests a counterpart that completes what is lacking, creating a unified whole.

[ILL] Consider a lock and a key. They are different in shape and function, yet they are "meet" (suitable) for one another. One is essential to the purpose of the other.

Slide 9 Question: How does Scripture view the addition of children to the family unit?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Lo, children are a heritage of the Lord.” (Ps. 127:3) “Children's children are the crown of old men, and the glory of children are their fathers.” (Prov. 17:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elder sitting with grandchildren around his knees, a look of pride and wisdom on his face.

---

Slide 11 Progressive Disclosure:
• **Heritage:** Children are a gift entrusted by God, not a burden.
• **Crown:** Grandchildren are a sign of honor and established legacy.
• **Glory:** Fathers are to provide dignity and a righteous example.

[SN] "Heritage" implies stewardship. Parents are stewards of their children's souls, entrusted to train them for the future, immortal life. The home is the nursery of the church.

Slide 12 Question: Does the happiness of a home depend on wealth or the abundance of possessions?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wealthy merchant counting coins at a table, looking unsatisfied and weary in the dim light.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “A man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15) “Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.” (Prov. 15:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a humble family sitting around a simple wooden table with vegetable bowls, their faces glowing with laughter and love.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Jesus teaches that the quality of life is spiritual, not material. Solomon adds that the atmosphere of the home is more nutritious than the food on the table.

[DYK] A "stalled ox" refers to a calf fattened for a special feast, representing the height of luxury. Yet, luxury without love is emptiness.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting contrasting a lavish feast where guests look angry versus a simple meal where people look joyful.

---

Slide 15 Illustration: A house is built by hands, but a home is built by hearts. You can buy a house with money, but you cannot buy a happy home; that requires the currency of love and contentment.

Slide 16 Question: What circumstance makes a home—even a comfortable one—undesirable?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stormy wilderness landscape, rocky and barren, yet looking peaceful in its solitude.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.” (Prov. 21:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man sitting alone on a rock in a desert landscape, looking more at peace than a man arguing in a doorway.

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: Contentiousness (constant arguing) destroys the sanctuary nature of the home. Solitude in a harsh "wilderness" is preferable to living in a comfortable house filled with an angry spirit.

[SN] The home and the Sabbath are the "twin institutions" of Eden that survived the Fall. Both were designed for rest and relationship. Strife disrupts this Edenic purpose.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a broken clay vessel on a floor, symbolizing the disruption of peace within a home.

---

Slide 19 Practical Application: How can we cultivate a happy home today?
1. Recognize the home as God's creation.
2. Cherish family as a "heritage."
3. Prioritize relationship ("love and herbs") over luxury.
4. Be a peacemaker to guard the atmosphere.
