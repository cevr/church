Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.” (Daniel 7:17; see also Daniel 8:20-22)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The text outlines a succession of world empires represented by beasts in Daniel 7 and 8:
1. **Babylon** (The Lion)
2. **Medo-Persia** (The Bear/Ram)
3. **Grecia** (The Leopard/He-goat)
4. **Pagan Rome** (The Terrible Beast)

Slide 4 [DYK]: Alexander the Great
Alexander, represented by the "notable horn" of the goat, conquered the known world in just ten years. Prophecy predicted he would be "broken off" in his prime; he died at age 32, and his empire was divided among his four generals.

Slide 5 Question: What power arises after the Roman Empire, and what is its character?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “He shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws.” (Daniel 7:25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing on a raised dais in a grand hall, speaking with an outstretched hand while onlookers listen intently.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Emerging from the fragments of the Roman Empire, the "little horn" represents Papal Rome. The prophecy notes this power would seek to uproot earthly kingdoms, speak blasphemies, persecute God’s people, and attempt to alter God’s law.

Slide 8 Term Definition: Blasphemy
In this prophetic context, blasphemy refers to a human power claiming the prerogatives of God, such as the power to forgive sins or the authority to change divine law.

Slide 9 Question: What is the longest time prophecy in the Bible, and when does it end?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest standing before the veil of the Sanctuary, golden light reflecting off his breastplate.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: This is the 2300-day prophecy. In Bible prophecy, a day equals a year (Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6). This vast period concludes with the cleansing of the sanctuary.

Slide 12 [ILL]: The Measuring Line
Imagine a long measuring line representing 2300 years. To know where it ends, you must know where it begins. Prophecy provides a specific "stake in the ground" to anchor the timeline.

Slide 13 Question: When does this 2300-year prophecy begin?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks...” (Daniel 9:25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King Artaxerxes on his throne gesturing permission to Ezra to return to Jerusalem.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The starting point is the decree of Artaxerxes to restore Jewish government in **457 B.C.**
*   From 457 B.C., the timeline extends 2300 years forward.
*   This brings us to **1844 A.D.**

[SN] Daniel 9 provides the key (the starting date) to unlock the lock (the duration) of Daniel 8.

Slide 16 Question: What specific portion of this time was allotted to the Jewish people and the coming of the Messiah?

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city...” (Daniel 9:24)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Daniel kneeling in prayer by a window, looking toward the west.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The word "determined" literally means "cut off." The first 70 weeks (490 years) of the longer 2300-year prophecy were cut off specifically for the Jewish nation.

---

Slide 19 Timeline Events:
*   **483 Years (27 A.D.):** The anointing of Christ (Baptism).
*   **The Final Week (31 A.D.):** The Messiah is "cut off" (Crucifixion), causing the sacrifice to cease.
*   **End of 70 Weeks (34 A.D.):** The stoning of Stephen, marking the gospel going to the Gentiles.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: The accuracy of this prophecy confirms Jesus is the Messiah. He appeared exactly when the timeline predicted. If the arrival of Jesus (the first part) is true, the cleansing of the sanctuary in 1844 (the second part) must also be true.

Slide 21 Question: What began in 1844 at the end of the 2300 days?

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “...then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.” (Daniel 8:14)

---

Slide 23 Explanation: In 1844, the 2300 years ended. This marked the beginning of the "cleansing of the Heavenly Sanctuary." Jesus, our High Priest, began His final work of judgment and intercession, preparing to claim His people before His Second Coming.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: We are living in the time of judgment, but also of hope. Just as God’s timetable for the first coming of Jesus was perfect, His timetable for the conclusion of history is precise. We can trust the Guide who knows the end from the beginning.
