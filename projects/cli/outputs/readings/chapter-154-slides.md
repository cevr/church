---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.” (Exodus 20:16)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: While this commandment is often associated with a courtroom setting, the spirit of the law extends to our daily conversation. To "bear false witness" is to damage the reputation of another through untruths or insinuations.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, a person’s reputation (their "name") was considered their most valuable asset, often more important than wealth. To destroy a name was considered a form of social murder.

Slide 4 Question: Is the human tongue easily controlled by natural willpower?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: but the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil; full of deadly poison.” (James 3:7, 8)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The apostle James uses a stark comparison from nature. Humanity has dominion over the animal kingdom, yet the smallest member of our own body—the tongue—remains wild. This indicates that self-discipline alone is insufficient to cure a gossiping tongue; it requires a power outside of ourselves.

[ILL] Imagine a small match dropped in a dry forest. Just as a tiny spark can incinerate acres of trees, a few careless words can destroy relationships and communities built over years.

Slide 7 Question: Why is our speech often inconsistent, and where do our words truly originate?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a village well, with people drawing water, highlighting the source of the water deep below.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing... these things ought not so to be.” (James 3:10). “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” (Matthew 12:34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stream of water; one side is clear and fresh, the other muddy and bitter, merging into one flow.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: Jesus teaches that the mouth is merely the overflow valve of the heart. If the water in the bucket is bitter, it is because the well is bitter. Gossip is not primarily a mouth problem; it is a heart problem.

Slide 10 Term Definition: **Abundance**
This implies a surplus or overflowing. We speak what we are full of. If we are full of grace, we speak grace. If we are full of self and criticism, we speak gossip.

Slide 11 Question: Since we cannot tame the tongue ourselves, how do we find deliverance?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man kneeling in the dust, looking upward with a plea for help on his face.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 7:24-25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ reaching down a hand to lift a weary traveler from a pit or shadow.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The struggle against the "law of sin" in our members (including the tongue) drives us to Christ. Victory comes not by trying harder to silence ourselves, but by yielding our members to God (Romans 6:13) and allowing His Spirit to renew the heart.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The connection between the "unrenewed heart" and the "unruly tongue" mirrors the sanctuary service; the heart must be cleansed by the blood of the Lamb before the incense (our prayers and words) can be sweet-smelling to God.

Slide 14 Question: What specific instruction is given regarding "talebearing" and its cure?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two figures whispering in a marketplace while others look on concerned.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people...” (Leviticus 19:16). “Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.” (Proverbs 26:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a campfire slowly dying out into embers because the wood has been removed.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: A "talebearer" is one who carries secrets or hurtful stories from person to person. The solution offered in Proverbs is mechanical and simple: remove the fuel. If you refuse to listen to or repeat gossip, the fire of contention suffocates and dies.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "talebearer" in Leviticus 19 is *rakil*, which comes from a root meaning "to trade" or "to traffic." A gossip is a merchant of secrets, trading other people's private matters for social currency.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient merchant holding a scale, trading goods, symbolizing the trading of information.

Slide 17 Question: How serious is the issue of our words in the final judgment?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a great throne room, with books of record being opened in a solemn atmosphere.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.” (Matthew 12:37)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scribe writing carefully on a long parchment scroll.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: Words are the index of the character. In the investigative judgment, our words serve as evidence of whether our hearts were truly changed by grace or remained hard and critical.

Slide 20 Question: What is the beautiful alternative to gossip?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a silver basket holding radiant golden apples, artistic and ornate.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.” (Proverbs 25:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two friends sitting together, one speaking kindly and encouragingly to the other.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: God does not merely want us to be silent; He wants us to be edifying. A word spoken at the right time, with the right spirit, is valuable and beautiful.

Slide 23 Practical Application: How can we apply this stewardship of speech today?
• Before speaking, ask: Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary?
• Refuse to be the "wood" for someone else's fire; gently change the subject.
• Pray Psalm 141:3: "Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips."
• Yield the tongue to God as an instrument of righteousness.
