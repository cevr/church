Study Title: The Divinity of Christ

Question: Is Jesus Christ described merely as a good man, or is He set forth as a Divine being in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.” (Hebrews 1:8)

Explanation: Here, the Father addresses the Son directly as "God." This establishes Christ’s supreme authority and eternal nature. He is not a subject in the kingdom; He holds the sceptre of the kingdom.

[DYK] The "sceptre" mentioned in Hebrews is a staff carried by a ruler as a symbol of sovereignty. In the hands of Christ, it is a sceptre of "righteousness" (or uprightness), meaning His rule is based on perfect justice, unlike earthly kingdoms often built on force.

Question: Did Christ exist before He was born in Bethlehem?

Biblical Answer: “And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.” (John 17:5)

Explanation: Christ is pre-existent. He is not a created being who came into existence at His human birth. He shares an eternal glory with the Father that existed before the creation of the world.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The pre-existence of Christ is the foundation of the plan of salvation. If He were a created being, He could not fully reveal the Father, nor could His life pay the infinite price for the sins of the whole world. Only the Creator can redeem the creation.

Question: How was the incarnation—God becoming man—accomplished?

Biblical Answer: “The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” (Luke 1:35)

Explanation: This was a divine miracle. Christ’s humanity was not of natural origin alone; it was the "power of the Highest" uniting divinity with humanity.

Question: Did becoming a human annul (cancel out) His divinity?

Biblical Answer: “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.” (1 Timothy 3:16)

Term Definition: “Mystery of Godliness” refers to the profound truth that the Infinite God could take upon Himself finite human nature. He did not cease to be God; He was God "manifest" (revealed) in human form.

[ILL] Consider a King who puts on the garments of a peasant to walk among his people, to understand their hardships and help them. Though he wears common clothes, he does not lose his royal identity or authority; he is simply veiling his glory to be approachable.

Question: How does Jesus describe His unity with the Father?

Biblical Answer: “I and My Father are one.” (John 10:30)

Explanation: Jesus claims total unity with God. While they are distinct persons, they are one in nature and essence.

Question: In what specific ways are the Father and Son "one"?

Biblical Answer: “Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.” (John 17:11)

Explanation: Just as Christ prays for His disciples to be united, He illustrates that He and the Father are one in purpose, spirit, and work. They operate in perfect harmony for the salvation of man.

Question: What evidence does Scripture give of Christ's creative power?

Biblical Answer: “For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth... all things were created by him, and for him.” (Colossians 1:16; see also John 1:1-3)

Deeper Insight: If Christ created "all things," He Himself cannot be a "thing" that was created. He stands outside of creation as its Author.

Question: What titles are given to Jesus that prove His divinity?

Biblical Answer: “And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6)

Explanation: The prophet Isaiah identifies the coming Child not just as a peace-bringer, but as "The Mighty God."

Question: Why was it necessary for the Divine Christ to take on human nature?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest... to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.” (Hebrews 2:17)

Explanation: He had to become like us to represent us. By taking our nature, He can understand our struggles and serve as a "merciful and faithful high priest."

Question: How much of the "Godhead" (Deity) dwells in Christ?

Biblical Answer: “For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.” (Colossians 2:9)

[SN] The word "Godhead" here (Greek: *theotēs*) refers to the very essence and nature of being God. It is not just that God's blessings are in Him, but that the fullness of the Divine Nature resides in His physical body.

Question: What is our privilege since we have a Saviour who is both fully God and fully man?

Biblical Answer: “Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.” (Hebrews 4:16)

Practical Application: Because Jesus is God, He has the power to help us. Because Jesus became man, He has the sympathy to understand us. We need not fear approaching Him; we can come "boldly" with our needs, knowing He is both our King and our Brother.
