---

Slide 1 Question: When given a choice of where to live, what motivated Lot’s decision?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere... even as the garden of the Lord... Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan.” (Genesis 13:10-11)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Lot made his decision based on visual appeal and economic advantage. He prioritized temporal prosperity and comfort over spiritual safety and separation.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The Bible notes that Lot "pitched his tent toward Sodom" (Genesis 13:12). He did not move into the city immediately; he moved nearby, and gradually ended up inside. Compromise is rarely a cliff; it is usually a slope.

Slide 5 Question: What was the true spiritual condition of Sodom?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her... neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.” (Ezekiel 16:49)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: While Genesis mentions they were "wicked," Ezekiel reveals the root causes: pride, luxury, and laziness. These conditions calloused their hearts, leading to a lack of compassion for the poor and eventually to abominable sins.

Slide 8 Term Definition: **Idleness**
Here, this refers to a leisure-filled life devoid of purposeful labor. Useful labor is a safeguard against temptation, while idleness serves as a workshop for evil.

Slide 9 Question: How did living in this environment affect Lot as a believer?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “[God] delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked: (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day...).” (2 Peter 2:7-8)

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Lot did not lose his faith, but he lost his peace. He was "vexed"—tormented and worn down—daily. Living in a center of vice requires a constant, exhausting mental battle to maintain one's integrity.

---

Slide 12 Illustration: Think of a filter in a polluted stream. While it may stop some debris, the constant pressure of the rushing, dirty water eventually clogs and damages it. A righteous soul in a corrupt environment is under constant pressure.

Slide 13 Question: When judgment was imminent, what was the instruction for salvation?

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.” (Genesis 19:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of angels pointing toward dark mountains in the distance, urging a family to run away from the city walls.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The instruction was for total separation. There was no time to save possessions or hesitate. The command to "look not behind" indicated that one’s affections must be completely severed from the city and its lifestyle.

---

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Lot tried to warn his family, but he "seemed as one that mocked" (Genesis 19:14). Because he had voluntarily lived among them, his witness had lost its power. When the crisis came, his words carried no weight.

Slide 17 Question: What happened to Lot’s wife, and what does it signify?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a woman pausing on a path, turning her head to look back over her shoulder.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.” (Genesis 19:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lonely, white pillar of salt standing on a barren plain, with smoke rising from a city in the far distance.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Her body left the city, but her heart remained there. Looking back indicated a reluctance to obey God and a secret longing for the life she was leaving behind.

---

Slide 20 Speaker Note: **Spirit-led Tangent**
Jesus specifically warns in Luke 17:32, "Remember Lot’s wife." This pillar serves as a monument to the truth that half-hearted obedience is insufficient for salvation.

Slide 21 Question: How did Jesus connect the days of Lot to the end of the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching a group of disciples, gesturing with his hand as if recounting history.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded... Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.” (Luke 17:28, 30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a busy ancient marketplace, merchants selling wares and people laughing, completely unaware of any danger.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: Jesus describes a state of normalcy. The people were not expecting judgment; they were entirely absorbed in business and pleasure. The danger was not just their wickedness, but their total absorption in temporal things.

---

Slide 24 Did You Know? Just as Sodom is set forth as an "ensample" (2 Peter 2:6), the suddenness of its destruction warns us that earthly security can vanish in an hour.

Slide 25 Question: What is the final destiny of the "cities of the nations"?

---

Slide 26 Biblical Answer: “And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell... to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.” (Revelation 16:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of massive stone pillars and walls crumbling and falling, symbolizing the collapse of human power.

---

Slide 27 Explanation: Under the final judgments, the structures of man—no matter how strong, wealthy, or technically advanced—will crumble. The "cities of the nations" will fall just as Sodom did.

Slide 28 Practical Application:
1. **Guard your eyes:** Do not choose your lifestyle based on visual appeal alone.
2. **Guard your heart:** Do not become desensitized to the sin around you.
3. **Be ready to move:** If God called you to leave everything today, could you do it without "looking back"?
