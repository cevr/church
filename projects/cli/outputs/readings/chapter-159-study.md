Study Title: Faith vs. Presumption: Walking Humbly with God

Question: What is the definition of "presumption"?

Answer: "The act of believing upon probable evidence, or taking for granted; belief upon incomplete proof; opinion. The act of venturing beyond due bounds... unreasonable confidence." (Webster’s Dictionary)

Explanation: In a spiritual sense, presumption is a counterfeit of faith. While faith claims God's promises and obeys His word, presumption claims God's blessings while disregarding His conditions. It is an attitude of "venturing beyond due bounds" or assuming God will protect us even when we willfully choose a path He has forbidden.

[ILL] Imagine a child holding a parent's hand to cross a busy street; that is faith and trust. Now imagine the child letting go and running into traffic, assuming the parent will somehow magically stop the cars; that is presumption.

Question: How does God view acts of presumption?

Biblical Answer: "But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously... the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people." (Numbers 15:30)

Explanation: To act presumptuously is to act "high-handedly" (as the Hebrew implies), or in open rebellion. It is considered a reproach—an insult—to God because it implies that the human will is superior to divine command.

Question: What happened when the Israelites attempted to fight their enemies without God’s permission?

Biblical Answer: "But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the camp... Then the Amalekites came down... and smote them..." (Numbers 14:44-45)

Explanation: The Israelites had previously refused to enter the land when God commanded it. Now, attempting to "make up" for it, they attacked without His presence (symbolized by the Ark and Moses). Zeal without obedience is not faith; it is presumption. Success is found only in moving when the cloud moves and staying when the cloud stays.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** This incident highlights the importance of the Sanctuary service in Israel's life. The Ark of the Covenant represented the very throne of God. By leaving the Ark behind, the army was essentially trying to fight spiritual battles with carnal weapons, separated from the source of their strength.

Question: How serious is the act of altering God's specific instructions regarding worship?

Biblical Answer: "And Nadab and Abihu... offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them..." (Leviticus 10:1, 2)

Term Definition: "Strange Fire" refers to common fire. The fire on the altar of burnt offering was originally kindled by God Himself and was to be kept burning. Nadab and Abihu, likely under the influence of wine (see Lev 10:9), treated the holy as common and substituted their own method for God's command.

[DYK] In the ancient mindset, fire represented the presence and acceptance of a deity. By using "strange fire," these priests were effectively creating a self-made religion rather than ministering in the religion God established.

Question: How is the sin of presumption described in Bible prophecy regarding the "Little Horn" power?

Biblical Answer: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High... and think to change times and laws." (Daniel 7:25)

Explanation: The ultimate act of presumption is for a human power to place itself above the Creator. This prophecy points to the Papacy, which historically claimed the authority to alter God's immutable law—specifically the Ten Commandments—by changing the Sabbath to Sunday.

Deeper Insight: The Apostle Paul calls this power the "man of sin" who "exalteth himself above all that is called God" (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4). While Jesus humbled Himself to save humanity, the spirit of presumption exalts self to replace God.

Question: What was King David’s prayer to be protected from this danger?

Biblical Answer: "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression." (Psalm 19:13)

Explanation: David recognized that even a "man after God's own heart" was capable of arrogance. He realized he could not keep himself; he needed God to "keep back" his natural impulses. Presumptuous sin, if left unchecked, leads to the "great transgression"—a state of rebellion where the conscience is seared.

[SN] **Theology Note:** This connects to the "Unpardonable Sin." Genesis 6:3 states, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man." Presumption is dangerous because it eventually silences the conviction of the Holy Spirit. This is why Paul warns in Ephesians 4:30, "Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God."

Practical Application: How do we avoid presumption today?
1.  **Check the Word:** Do not assume God approves of a decision if it contradicts Scripture.
2.  **Examine Motives:** Are we acting out of faith (obedience) or arrogance (self-will)?
3.  **Pray for Restraint:** Like David, we should pray for God to keep us back from willful sin.

God desires us to be bold in faith, but humble in walk. Faith takes God at His word; presumption takes God for granted.
