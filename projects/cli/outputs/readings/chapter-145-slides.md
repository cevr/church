Study Title: Praise and Thanksgiving: The Language of Faith

---

Slide 1 Question: For what purpose were humanity and all things created?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” (Revelation 4:11)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: We are not the product of chance. We were designed by God, for God. Our existence is intended to bring Him joy and reflect His character.

However, Scripture reveals that in our natural state, we have failed this design: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The word "pleasure" in this text does not mean God uses us for mere entertainment. It speaks of His *will* and *desire*.

Just as an artist finds pleasure in a masterpiece that reflects their vision, God desires to see His love reflected in us.

Slide 5 Question: Since we have fallen short, what motivates us to return to God?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?” (Romans 2:4)

---

Slide 7 The Process of Return:

1.  **Not Fear:** It is not the threat of punishment that genuinely changes the heart.
2.  **Goodness:** It is the kindness and patience of God that melts the heart.
3.  **Repentance:** This leads to a true change of mind and direction.

Slide 8 Illustration: Think of a block of ice. You can hammer it, and it will only shatter. But if you place it in the warm sunlight, it melts and changes form effortlessly.

The law may hammer the conscience, but only the warmth of God's love (His goodness) melts the heart into repentance.

Slide 9 Question: How often should we give thanks, and does this include difficult times?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Ephesians 5:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family gathered around a meager meal, heads bowed in sincere thanksgiving, lit by a central oil lamp.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: This is a challenging command. We are told to give thanks "always" and for "all things."

This is possible because of the assurance in Romans 8:28. We do not thank God *for* the pain, but we thank Him that He is sovereign *over* the pain and can produce good from it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Joseph in Egypt, looking calm and dignified despite being in a foreign land, symbolizing trust in sovereignty.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: **"Sacrifice of Praise"**

Derived from Hebrews 13:15 and Psalm 50:23. Praise is easy when life is good. When life is hard, praise becomes a "sacrifice"—something that costs us effort but is highly valued by God.

---

Slide 13 Spirit-Led Insight: Consider Paul and Silas in Acts 16. Beaten, bleeding, and in a dungeon, "at midnight" they sang praises. The result was an earthquake and deliverance.

Ellen White emphasized that talking of darkness brings darkness, but talking of faith brings light. Praise is a weapon that shakes the enemy’s prison.

---

Slide 14 Question: How does our praise affect those around us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of people listening intently to a speaker in a village square, warm afternoon light.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.” (Psalm 34:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of David playing a harp surrounded by weary people who look uplifted by the music.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Faith is personal, but not private. When we declare what God has done for us, it encourages others who are struggling.

The "humble"—those who are hurting or seeking God—gain hope when they hear our testimony.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person sharing bread and conversation with a beggar, conveying shared hope and comfort.

---

Slide 17 Did You Know? In the ancient Hebrew sanctuary service, many offerings were communal. When a person offered a "thank offering," it was shared with others. Your gratitude feeds the faith of your neighbor.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient feast near the tabernacle, people sharing food and rejoicing together, historically respectful.

---

Slide 18 Question: What is the danger of an unthankful heart?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure turning their back on a beautiful sunset, walking into the shadows, symbolizing ingratitude.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” (Romans 1:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person lost in a dark forest, stumbling, representing a darkened mind and confusion.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Ingratitude is the first step toward spiritual darkness.

When we stop acknowledging God as the source of our blessings, we trust in ourselves ("vain imaginations"). This disconnects us from truth.

---

Slide 21 Illustration: Imagine a diver whose air hose is connected to a ship. If the diver decides he no longer needs to acknowledge the ship and cuts the line, he is lost. Thanksgiving is the "air hose" that keeps us connected to the Source of life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a ship on a turbulent sea, with a rope anchor line descending into the deep water, representing a vital connection.

---

Slide 22 Question: What happens when we combine prayer with thanksgiving?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands clasped in prayer, resting on an open scripture scroll, soft candlelight.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” (Philippians 4:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in a peaceful room, looking serene and burden-free.

---

Slide 24 Deeper Insight: Anxiety and Thanksgiving cannot occupy the same space in the mind.

The antidote to anxiety is not just asking God for help (supplication), but asking with a memory of what He has already done (thanksgiving).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a chaotic storm outside a window, but inside is calm and warm, representing inner peace amidst trouble.

---

Slide 25 Historical Note: In 2 Chronicles 20, King Jehoshaphat sent a choir out *before* the army. They sang a song of thanks, not request.

The victory was won not by fighting, but by praising. In the final conflict, our trust in God's word is our only defense.

Slide 26 Practical Application:

*   **In Prayer:** Before asking for new blessings, spend the first few minutes thanking God for specific past answers.
*   **In Public:** Share a testimony this week with a "humble" person who needs encouragement.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two people walking along a path in conversation, one listening intently to the other.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application:

*   **In Trial:** If you are facing a "midnight" situation like Paul and Silas, try singing or reading a Psalm of praise, and watch how the atmosphere changes.
