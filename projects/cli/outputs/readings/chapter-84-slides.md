Slide 3 Explanation: A memorial is anything intended to preserve the memory of a person or an event—like a monument or a special day. Just as we build monuments to remember significant historical events, God has established a memorial so that His nature and authority are remembered by every generation.

Slide 4 Did You Know?
In the Bible, physical objects were sometimes used as memorials. When Israel crossed the Jordan River, Joshua set up twelve stones so that future children would ask, "What mean these stones?" (Joshua 4:21-22). God often uses physical symbols to teach spiritual truths.

Slide 7 Definition & Illustration:
**Term Definition:** “Wonderful works” refers to the miracles of God's creation and providence.

**Illustration:** An artist signs their painting so everyone knows who created it. In a similar way, God has placed a "signature" on His creation to remind us that He is the Maker.

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy... For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:8, 11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, sitting peacefully at rest as the sun sets on the first Sabbath.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: The Sabbath is the only commandment that begins with the word "Remember." It points directly back to the creation week. By resting on the seventh day, we acknowledge that we are not self-made; we are creatures honoring our Creator.

Slide 11 A Sanctuary in Time
[SN] Note that God sanctified (made holy) a portion of *time*, not a place. Cathedrals can be destroyed and shrines can be lost, but time travels with us everywhere. The Sabbath is a "sanctuary in time" that cannot be torn down by human hands.

Slide 12 Question: Is the Sabbath only a memorial of Creation, or does it also signify a relationship with God?

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Moreover also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)

Slide 14 The Sign of the Sabbath
*   **It is a sign of Authority:** He is the Creator.
*   **It is a sign of Relationship:** They are "My Sabbaths."
*   **It is a sign of Sanctification:** God makes us holy.

[ILL] Just as a wedding ring is a visible sign of an exclusive relationship between a husband and wife, the Sabbath is a visible sign of the exclusive relationship between God and His people.

Slide 15 Question: Some claim the Sabbath was only for the Jewish nation. According to the New Testament, who are the "heirs" of Abraham's promises?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people from different nations gathering to listen to an apostle preach.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham looking up at the night sky, the stars representing his countless spiritual descendants.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: The New Testament teaches that anyone who accepts Jesus Christ becomes part of spiritual Israel. Therefore, the "sign" between God and His people applies to all who belong to Christ.

[DYK] The Apostle James addressed his epistle to "the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad" (James 1:1), referring to the Christian church.

Slide 18 Question: Will this memorial continue even after sin is destroyed, in the New Earth?

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before Me... from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 66:22-23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast multitude of people in white robes worshiping together in a perfect, restored paradise.

---

Slide 20 Deeper Insight: The Sabbath memorializes Creation. Since the fact that God created the universe will never change, the memorial of that fact will never cease. Even in the perfect world to come, we will gather weekly to honor the Source of our life.

[SN] In Revelation 4:11, the song of the redeemed is: "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory... for thou hast created all things." The theme of Creation is the song of eternity.

---

Slide 21 Practical Application: How can we honor God's memorial this week?
*   By resting from our own labor.
*   By acknowledging God as our Creator.
*   By trusting in His power to sanctify us.
*   By looking forward to the eternal rest in the New Earth.
