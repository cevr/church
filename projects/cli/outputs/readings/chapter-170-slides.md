Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man.” (Genesis 2:22)

Slide 3 Explanation: Marriage is of divine origin. It was not a human invention developed over centuries of social evolution. It was instituted in Eden by the Creator Himself before the fall of man.

---

Slide 4 Insight: Like the Sabbath, marriage is a gift from Paradise designed for the benefit of the human race.

[DYK] The word "woman" in Hebrew (*ishshah*) is linguistically derived from "man" (*ish*). This reinforces the idea that she was taken *out* of man to be part *of* him—equal in nature and standing.

Slide 5 Question: What was God’s specific purpose and arithmetic for marriage?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.” (Genesis 2:24)

Slide 7 Progressive Disclosure:
• **Companionship**: “It is not good that the man should be alone.” (Genesis 2:18)
• **Unity**: The math of heaven is not one plus one equals two, but two becoming one.
• **Procreation**: To “replenish the earth” with a godly lineage.

Slide 8 Illustration: Think of two streams merging into a single river. Once they join, the waters cannot be separated into their original sources. They flow together toward a common destination. This is the "one flesh" principle.

Slide 9 Term Definition: “Help meet” (Genesis 2:18)

This term does not mean a servant or a subordinate. The original Hebrew implies a helper that is "opposite" or "corresponding to" him—like a mirror image or a perfect counterpart that completes what is lacking.

Slide 10 Question: If God designed marriage for one man and one woman, where did polygamy come from?

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And Lamech took unto him two wives... and Lamech said unto his wives... I have slain a man.” (See Genesis 4:19, 23 and John 8:44)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man dressed in rich but darker robes standing between two women, looking proud and defiant.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Polygamy originated not with God’s people, but in the line of Cain—specifically with Lamech, a man noted for murder and rebellion. It is a counterfeit of the divine plan.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the descendants of Cain building a city, contrasting with the simple pastoral life of the godly line.

---

Slide 13 Spirit-Led Insight: The pattern in Genesis shows that the "sons of God" maintained the original order until they mixed with the "daughters of men." When the distinct line between the church and the world blurred, the sanctity of the home was lost, leading to the Flood.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a large crowd of people in ancient times, symbolizing the mixing of multitudes before the Flood.

---

Slide 14 Question: How do we account for Bible heroes like Abraham, Jacob, or David having multiple wives?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King David looking contemplative and solemn in his palace.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.” (Ecclesiastes 7:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wise man writing on a scroll in a study, reflecting on human nature.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The Bible records the sins of holy men, but it does not endorse them.

• **Abraham**: His union with Hagar was a lack of faith, resulting in sorrow and separation.
• **Jacob**: He was deceived; his life was marked by family strife and jealousy.
• **David**: His departure from God's law led to tragedy in his household.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Hagar walking away into the desert with Ishmael, depicting the sorrow of departure.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: God blessed these men *because of their repentance* and faith, not because of their polygamy. In every instance where the original plan was violated, the Bible records heartache, rivalry, and spiritual decline as the result.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a biblical patriarch kneeling in prayer, bathed in a beam of light signifying repentance and grace.

---

Slide 18 Did You Know? When God preserved the human race through the Flood, He returned to the original plan. Only Noah and his three sons, each with *one* wife (eight people total), entered the ark.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Noah’s Ark with four couples walking two-by-two up the ramp, symbolizing the restoration of the family unit.

---

Slide 19 Question: Did Jesus and the apostles change or reaffirm the original plan?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching a crowd on a hillside, soft daylight illuminating His face.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “From the beginning of the creation God made them male and female... What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.” (Mark 10:6-9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus gesturing towards the horizon, emphasizing the eternal nature of God's word.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Jesus pointed back to "the beginning"—before custom and culture corrupted the institution. The Apostle Paul confirmed this, requiring church leaders to be "the husband of one wife" (1 Timothy 3:2).

Slide 22 Practical Application: How can we honor the marriage institution today?

• Treat marriage as a holy covenant, not just a civil contract.
• Guard the mind against modern "counterfeits."
• Seek a partner who honors God's design.
• View your spouse as your God-given counterpart for mutual sanctification.
