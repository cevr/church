Study Title: The Mystery of a Sinless Life

---

Slide 1 Question: What testimony does Scripture give regarding the moral character of Jesus Christ?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth.” (1 Peter 2:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a close-up of Jesus speaking, His expression radiating absolute purity and truth, soft golden light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: While the Bible states that “all have sinned” (Romans 3:23), Jesus is the solitary exception. He challenged His enemies, “Which of you convinceth Me of sin?” (John 8:46), and they could find no flaw.

---

Slide 4 Term Definition: “Guile” refers to deceit, cunning, or trickery. To have no guile means to be transparent, honest, and authentically pure in speech and intent.

[DYK] In the Old Testament sacrificial system, a lamb had to be “without blemish” to be accepted (Exodus 12:5). Peter uses this imagery to show that Jesus is the perfect fulfillment of that symbol—spiritually spotless.

---

Slide 5 Question: Was Jesus’ sinlessness due to an inability to be tempted, or did He face the same struggles we do?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in the wilderness, looking weary and human, sitting on a stone, soft light revealing the harsh environment.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “[He] was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.” (Hebrews 4:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in deep prayer on a mountain, a subtle, shadowy suggestion of testing in the background, soft light focusing on His resolve.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Jesus felt the full weight of temptation. The difference was not in the *temptation*, but in the *response*. He remained sinless not because He couldn't sin, but because He chose not to.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus firmly turning His face away from a loaf of bread during his fast, expression resolute, soft light.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Rock and the Leaf.

[ILL] A strong wind blows against both a solid rock and a falling leaf. The leaf moves immediately, but the rock resists. The rock actually feels the force of the wind *more* than the leaf because it does not yield. Jesus, by resisting every temptation, felt the full weight of sin’s pressure more than any human ever has.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rugged cliffside enduring a storm, juxtaposed with leaves blowing away in the wind, dramatic lighting.

Slide 9 Question: How fully did Jesus enter into our human experience?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus working with wood, His hands rough from labor, looking fully human and relatable, soft light.

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same... Wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like unto His brethren...” (Hebrews 2:14, 17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus sitting with a group of common people, perhaps holding a child, fully integrated into the human family, warm ambient light.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Jesus took upon Himself our actual nature—“flesh and blood.” He entered the human family to be a “merciful and faithful high priest.” He understands our weakness because He has lived inside it.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The nature of Christ during the Incarnation is a profound mystery. Historic Adventist theology emphasizes that Christ took upon Himself the nature of man *after* the fall—meaning He inherited the innocent infirmities and weaknesses of humanity (hunger, fatigue, the capacity to die), yet He possessed a sinless character. He met sin on its own territory—the flesh—and conquered it there.

---

Slide 12 Question: What did God accomplish through Christ taking on "sinful flesh"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark, heavy chain representing the law of sin, sitting on a stone floor, soft light highlighting a broken link.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.” (Romans 8:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shaft of divine light breaking through dark storm clouds, illuminating a figure standing in victory, historically respectful.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: The law points out sin but cannot fix it because our flesh is weak. Jesus entered that same weak flesh and “condemned sin.” He proved it is possible, through the Spirit, to live in human flesh without serving sin.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll of the law resting next to an olive branch, symbolizing the Spirit's power to fulfill the law, soft light.

---

Slide 15 Question: If Jesus was human, by what power did He live this perfect life?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus kneeling in a garden, looking upward with total dependence, soft moonlight.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “I can of Mine own self do nothing.” (John 5:30) “The words that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself: but the Father that dwelleth in Me, He doth the works.” (John 14:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing with open hands, receiving light from heaven, symbolizing reception of power, historically respectful.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: This is the secret. Jesus did not use His own divine power to make His life easier. He lived as a man, totally dependent on the Father through faith, prayer, and surrender.

---

Slide 18 Illustration: The Glove.

[ILL] Imagine a glove. A glove cannot pick up a book by itself. But if a hand fills the glove, the glove moves and works. Jesus, in His humanity, was the vessel; the Father, through the Spirit, provided the power. He invites us to be filled with that same Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter’s hand working clay, symbolizing the Father working through the vessel of humanity, soft warm light.

---

Slide 19 Question: What was the singular purpose that drove Jesus?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking steadfastly on a road, His eyes fixed on a distant destination (Jerusalem), soft light.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “For I came down from heaven, not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me.” (John 6:38)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in Gethsemane, face to the ground in submission, soft shadows and a beam of light.

---

Slide 21 Progressive Disclosure:
• Surrender of self
• Alignment with God’s law
• Trust in the Father’s plan

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open Bible or scroll on a wooden table, illuminated by a simple oil lamp, representing alignment with God's will.

---

Slide 22 Deeper Insight: Sin is selfishness—doing “mine own will.” Righteousness is love and submission—doing the "will of Him that sent Me." Jesus lived a life of total self-renunciation.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: Consider the contrast with Lucifer. Lucifer said, "I will ascend," "I will be like the Most High" (Isaiah 14). Jesus said, "I can of Mine own self do nothing," and "Not my will, but Thine be done." The Great Controversy is a battle between the principle of Self-Exaltation and the principle of Self-Sacrificing Love.

Slide 23 Practical Application: How does Christ's sinless life help us today?
1. **Confidence:** A High Priest who understands.
2. **Example:** Victory is possible through dependence.
3. **Hope:** He can conquer sin in *our* flesh today.

---

Slide 24 Conclusion: We are called to follow His method: "I can of mine own self do nothing." When we surrender fully to the Father as Jesus did, we step into His victory.
