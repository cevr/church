---

Slide 1 Question: What is the most important thing a person can gain in life?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom.” (Proverbs 4:7)

“She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.” (Proverbs 3:15)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible establishes wisdom not merely as an option, but as the "principal" or primary pursuit of life.

Material wealth ("rubies") can be lost, but wisdom guides one toward honor, grace, and an eventual "crown of glory."

Slide 4 Did You Know?
[DYK] King Solomon, who wrote many of the Proverbs, was offered anything he desired by God. He chose wisdom instead of long life or riches. Because he prioritized wisdom, God granted him the other blessings as well.

Slide 5 Question: Where does this wisdom come from, and how do we receive it?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For the Lord giveth wisdom.” (Proverbs 2:6)

“If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.” (James 1:5)

Slide 7 Explanation: True wisdom is not a result of high IQ or academic degrees; it is a gift from God.

The text assures us that God gives "liberally" (generously) without finding fault in us for asking.

[ILL] Imagine a child who needs help with a heavy load. If they ask a loving father, he doesn't scold them for being weak; he gladly provides the strength. So it is with God when we ask for wisdom.

Slide 8 Question: What is the condition for receiving this wisdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man standing at a crossroads, looking conflicted and unsure of which way to turn.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the wind and tossed.” (James 1:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small wooden boat being tossed violently by large, dark waves in a stormy sea.

---

Slide 10 Term Definition: Wavering
"Wavering" implies being double-minded or undecided. It describes a person who wants God's wisdom but also wants to hold onto worldly methods.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person trying to hold onto a rock on the shore while simultaneously reaching for something drifting in the ocean.

---

Slide 11 Question: What is the foundation of true wisdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of massive stone foundation blocks being laid for a temple, representing strength and beginning.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments.” (Psalm 111:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe or scholar kneeling in deep reverence and awe before the Ark of the Covenant.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: Wisdom starts with a proper relationship with God—referenced here as "fear," which means deep reverence and awe.

This text links intellectual understanding directly to obedience. Doing His commandments clarifies the mind.

---

Slide 14 Note on Obedience
[SN] The connection between *doing* and *knowing* is vital. John 7:17 states that if anyone wills to do His will, he shall know the doctrine. Obedience is not a means of earning salvation, but the atmosphere in which true spiritual understanding breathes and grows.

Slide 15 Question: How does the Bible distinguish between God's wisdom and the world's wisdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two contrasting trees: one bearing dark, withered fruit, and the other bearing bright, healthy fruit.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.” (1 Corinthians 3:19)

“But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits...” (James 3:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a white dove descending with an olive branch, symbolizing peace and purity.

---

Slide 17 Comparison:
*   **Worldly Wisdom**: Often characterized by competition, pride, and "foolishness" in the eyes of Heaven.
*   **Heavenly Wisdom**: Characterized by purity, peace, and mercy.

---

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: Purity
James 3:17 lists "pure" as the first quality of heavenly wisdom. In the original Greek, this implies being clean, holy, and free from defilement. Wisdom is moral, not just intellectual.

Slide 19 Question: What is the physical and spiritual result of receiving God’s wisdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a silhouette of a man's head, with a bright light glowing from within.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “A man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.” (Ecclesiastes 8:1)

“Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind...” (Romans 12:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a close-up of a man’s face, smiling gently, illuminated by a warm, supernatural glow.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Wisdom changes a person from the inside out.

Just as Moses' face shone after speaking with God, a person who walks in God's wisdom exhibits a change in countenance—softening hardness ("boldness") and replacing it with the light of grace.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses descending Sinai, his face radiating light that causes others to cover their eyes.

---

Slide 22 Note on Transformation
[SN] This "renewing of the mind" allows the believer to "prove" the perfect will of God. It suggests that the human mind, under the influence of the Holy Spirit, becomes a testing ground where truth is validated against error.

---

Slide 23 Practical Application: How to apply this today.
*   **Prioritize**: Value spiritual insight more than financial gain.
*   **Pray**: Ask God for wisdom in specific situations daily.
*   **Obey**: Check your life against the Commandments to clear the channel.
*   **Evaluate**: Ask: "Is this path pure? Is it peaceable?"
