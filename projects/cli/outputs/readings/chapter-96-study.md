Study Title: The Sabbath: A Gift for All Nations

Question: Is the God of the Bible the God of the Jews only?

Biblical Answer: “Is He the God of the Jews only? Is He not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.” (Romans 3:29)

Explanation: God is the Creator of all humanity, not merely the tribal deity of one nation. Consequently, His moral government and His offer of salvation extend to every person on earth.

[DYK] The word "Gentile" in Scripture simply translates to "nations" (Hebrew *goyim*, Greek *ethnos*). It refers to anyone outside the specific covenant lineage of Abraham. The gospel message is that through Christ, the "middle wall of partition" is broken down.

Question: For whom did Jesus say the Sabbath was created?

Biblical Answer: “The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:27)

Explanation: Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath, declares its origin. He does not say "The Sabbath was made for the Jew," but for "man" (mankind). The Sabbath was instituted at Creation (Genesis 2:1-3), more than two thousand years before the existence of the Jewish nation.

[ILL] Consider the air we breathe or the sun that warms us. These were created for "man"—for all humanity. We would never say the sun is "Jewish." In the same way, the Sabbath is a universal blessing for the human race, providing rest and connection with the Creator.

Question: What specific promise does God give to the "stranger" (Gentile) who chooses to keep His Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord... everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of My covenant; even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer.” (Isaiah 56:6-7)

Term Definition: “Polluting it” implies treating the holy time as common time. To keep it means to treat it with the distinct sacredness God placed upon it.

Deeper Insight: Notice the sequence: the stranger joins the Lord *first* (relationship), then keeps the Sabbath (obedience/sign of relationship). The Sabbath is the outward sign of taking hold of God’s covenant.

[SN] The "Mixed Multitude" and the Law: When Israel left Egypt, a "mixed multitude" (Exodus 12:38) of non-Israelites went with them. God’s instruction was clear: "One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you" (Exodus 12:49). The manna test regarding the Sabbath (Exodus 16) applied to this mixed group equally. God has always had one standard of righteousness for all people.

Question: How does the Fourth Commandment itself address the Gentile?

Biblical Answer: “The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou... nor thy stranger that is within thy gates.” (Exodus 20:10)

Explanation: The commandment explicitly includes the "stranger." This shows that the rest provided by the Sabbath is a universal right and a universal duty. It protects the foreigner from being exploited for labor while the believer rests.

Question: Did the Apostle Paul and the early church treat the Sabbath as a day only for Jews?

Biblical Answer: “And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.” (Acts 18:4)

Explanation: Even in the Gentile city of Corinth, Paul used the Sabbath as the day for religious instruction and worship. In Acts 13:42, the "Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath." There is no record in the New Testament of the apostles instructing Gentiles to keep a different day.

[DYK] The book of Acts covers a period of roughly 30 years after the resurrection of Christ. Throughout this history, the seventh-day Sabbath remains the consistent day of worship for the apostles and their mixed congregations of Jews and Gentiles.

Question: Will the Sabbath be observed by the saved of all nations in the New Earth?

Biblical Answer: “And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 66:23)

Explanation: The Sabbath is not a temporary institution. It began in Eden before sin entered the world, and it continues in the New Earth after sin is destroyed. "All flesh"—redeemed from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people—will unite in worship on God's holy day.

Practical Application: The Sabbath is an invitation to all people to recognize God as their Creator.
• It reminds us we are not merely biological accidents, but created beings.
• It offers a weekly sanctuary in time for everyone, regardless of nationality.
• It identifies us as worshipers of the true God.

Since God invites "all flesh" to enter His rest, will you accept that invitation this week?
