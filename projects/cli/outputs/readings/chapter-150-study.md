Study Title: Where is Your Treasure? The Bible on Wealth and Giving

Question: How does God view the attitude of covetousness (the greedy desire to possess)?

Biblical Answer: “For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.” (Psalm 10:3)

Explanation: The language here is quite strong. While the world may congratulate someone for accumulating vast wealth at any cost, God looks at the heart. To "abhor" means to regard with disgust. This is because covetousness often replaces trust in God with trust in material things.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor, yet the Hebrew prophets frequently warned that how one *obtained* and *used* wealth mattered more than the wealth itself.

Question: Where does the ability to earn a living actually come from?

Biblical Answer: “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.” (Deuteronomy 8:18)

Explanation: We often credit our hard work, education, or cleverness for our success. Scripture reminds us that the very strength, health, and opportunity to work are gifts from God. We are not owners of the earth, but stewards of what God has entrusted to us.

[ILL] A manager of a store handles large amounts of money daily, but he knows the money does not belong to him—it belongs to the owner. He is responsible for how it is used. In the same way, we are managers of God’s resources.

Question: What warning did Jesus give regarding the accumulation of possessions?

Biblical Answer: “And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15)

Explanation: Jesus teaches that "life"—real, meaningful, spiritual existence—is not defined by how much we own. He illustrates this with the parable of the rich man who built bigger barns to store his crops, only to lose his soul that very night. God called that man a "fool" not because he was rich, but because he was "not rich toward God" (Luke 12:21).

Term Definition: “High-minded” (1 Timothy 6:17) refers to arrogance or pride. Wealth often tempts people to feel superior or self-sufficient, forgetting their need for God.

Question: What are those with means instructed to do with their resources?

Biblical Answer: “That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.” (1 Timothy 6:18)

Progressive Disclosure:
• **Do good:** Wealth is an active tool for service.
• **Ready to distribute:** Being generous without compulsion.
• **Willing to communicate:** In the archaic sense, this means "to share" or have fellowship through giving.

[SN] Early Adventist pioneers often lived by the principle of "systematic benevolence." They believed that if God gave the power to acquire means, those means should be used to spread the Gospel and help the needy, viewing their resources as fuel for the mission rather than for personal luxury.

Question: Does God value the size of the gift or the heart of the giver?

Biblical Answer: “For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.” (2 Corinthians 8:12)

Explanation: God is fair. He does not expect a person to give what they do not have. The value of the offering is measured by the "willing mind"—the spirit of sacrifice—rather than the dollar amount.

Deeper Insight: This principle transforms giving from a tax into an act of worship. A small gift from a person of limited means, given with love, is valued just as highly by heaven as a large gift from the wealthy.

Question: What happens to our hearts when we invest in God’s work?

Biblical Answer: “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” (Luke 12:34)

Explanation: This is a profound psychological and spiritual truth: our affections follow our investments. If we hoard money on earth, our hearts will be tied to this earth—anxious about markets, theft, or loss. If we invest our resources in God’s work (helping others, spreading the gospel), our hearts become knit to heaven.

[ILL] If you buy stock in a specific company, you immediately become interested in its success. You check the news about it; you care about its future. Similarly, when we "buy stock" in God's Kingdom through our offerings, our interest and affection naturally shift toward spiritual things.

Practical Application: How can we apply this today?
• Review our attitude: Do we hold our possessions loosely or tightly?
• Acknowledge the Source: Thank God for the "power to get wealth."
• Transfer funds: Consider how to move "treasure" from earth to heaven by supporting the needy or the gospel work this week.

[SN] Expanding on the "bags which wax not old" (Luke 12:33): Scott's commentary notes that earthly wealth is like putting money in a "bag with holes." Inflation, decay, and death eventually drain it all. Generosity is the only way to secure treasure in a place where it can never be lost.
