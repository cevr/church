Study Title: The State of the World Before Christ Returns

Question: What did Jesus say the moral condition of the world would be just before His return?

Biblical Answer: “As it was in the days of Noe [Noah], so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.” (Luke 17:26)

Explanation: Jesus draws a direct parallel between the time of Noah and the end of time. To understand the future, we look at the past. Genesis 6:5 describes Noah’s day as a time when “wickedness… was great” and thoughts were “only evil continually.” It was a time characterized by a rejection of God and widespread violence.

[DYK] In the "days of Noah," humanity possessed great physical strength and intellect, having lived for centuries. Yet, instead of leading to a golden age, their "imaginations" led to corruption. This suggests that human progress does not automatically equate to moral improvement.

Question: Will the world eventually become fully converted and good before the end?

Biblical Answer: “Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them.” (Matthew 13:30)

Explanation: In the Parable of the Wheat and Tares, Jesus explains that good (wheat) and evil (tares) will coexist until the very end. The "harvest" is the end of the world. We are not to expect a time when evil is eradicated by human effort prior to His return; rather, the separation happens at His coming.

[ILL] Imagine a garden where weeds have entangled their roots with the flowers. If you pull the weeds too early, you damage the flowers. The Master Gardener waits until the full maturity of the plant—the harvest—to make the final separation. God allows character to fully develop before the final judgment.

Question: If the whole world isn't converted, what is the purpose of preaching the Gospel?

Biblical Answer: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14)

Term Definition: **"For a witness"** implies giving testimony or evidence. The goal of preaching is to give every person a fair opportunity to choose a side, not necessarily to guarantee that every person will accept it.

Deeper Insight: This teaching corrects the mistaken belief (common in the 19th century) that the world would enter a "temporal millennium" of peace and total conversion before Jesus returns. The Bible teaches that the Gospel is an invitation, and the end comes when the invitation has been heard worldwide.

[SN] **The Great Controversy perspective:** God values free will above all. He does not force conversion. The "witness" ensures that when the end comes, God's justice is vindicated because everyone has made an informed decision for or against His government.

Question: What will be the political and social atmosphere in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “Proclaim ye this among the nations; prepare war, stir up the mighty men... Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.” (Joel 3:9, 10)

Progressive Disclosure:
• **Perilous Times:** Paul warns that men will "wax worse and worse" (2 Timothy 3:13).
• **False Security:** While nations prepare for conflict, there will be a simultaneous cry of "Peace, peace; when there is no peace" (Jeremiah 6:14).
• **Suddenness:** Destruction comes when the world feels most secure (1 Thessalonians 5:3).

[DYK] The phrase "beat your plowshares into swords" is the exact reverse of the famous peace prophecy in Micah 4:3. While God’s ultimate Kingdom brings peace, the nations' final act in this present age is a preparation for conflict.

Question: How should the Christian react to this darkening world?

Biblical Answer: “When these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.” (Luke 21:28)

Explanation: We are told, "Neither fear ye their fear" (Isaiah 8:12). While the world trembles at the condition of society, the believer sees these events as signposts. The worsening conditions are not a sign that God has lost control, but a sign that He is about to return to restore all things.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Connection:** The early Advent believers saw themselves as "watchmen" on the walls of Zion. They understood that true peace comes not from political treaties, but from the Prince of Peace. The darker the night, the brighter the hope of the Morning Star (Jesus).

Practical Application: How do we live in a "wheat and tares" world?
• **Don't be discouraged by evil:** We know it must grow until the harvest.
• **Be a witness:** Our job is to share the light, leaving the results to God.
• **Have courage:** When others are afraid of the future, we can offer the hope of redemption.
• **Look up:** Keep your focus on Jesus, not the crisis.
