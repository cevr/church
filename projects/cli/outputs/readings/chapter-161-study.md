Study Title: The Peril of Selfishness and the Power of Self-Sacrifice

Question: What is the root sin that violates the law of God?

Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt not covet.” (Exodus 20:17) AND “If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well.” (James 2:8)

Explanation: Selfishness is the direct opposite of the "Royal Law" of love. While the Royal Law commands us to value our neighbor as ourselves, selfishness directs all purpose, interest, and power toward the self, disregarding the needs of others.

[DYK] The source text cites Webster’s definition of selfishness as "supreme self-love" or "self-preference." It is the act of putting one's own happiness above the welfare of others.

Question: How does selfishness manifest in the conduct of an individual?

Biblical Answer:
*   **Lovers of Self:** “For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous.” (2 Timothy 3:2)
*   **Neglect of the Poor:** “But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?” (1 John 3:17)
*   **Seeking Precedence:** “Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.” (Matthew 20:21)

Progressive Disclosure: Scripture reveals selfishness in many forms: • pleasing ourselves rather than bearing the infirmities of the weak (Romans 15:1) • seeking personal gain like "greedy dogs" (Isaiah 56:11) • performing religious duties for monetary reward (Micah 3:11).

[ILL] Imagine a shepherd who feeds himself but starves the sheep. Isaiah 56:11 uses this imagery ("shepherds that cannot understand") to describe leaders who look only "to their own way" and "everyone for his gain."

Term Definition: "Charity" (1 Corinthians 13) – In the King James Version, this word often translates the Greek *agape*, meaning self-sacrificing, unconditional love. The text notes that Charity "seeketh not her own."

Question: Why is selfishness incompatible with the Christian faith?

Biblical Answer: “For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.” (Philippians 2:21) AND “If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.” (Matthew 16:24)

Explanation: One cannot follow Christ while leading a life centered on self. The very definition of discipleship involves self-denial. Furthermore, selfishness creates division in the "body" of believers, whereas God designs that members should have "the same care one for another" (1 Corinthians 12:25).

Deeper Insight: The source text identifies selfishness as a primary marker of the "last days" (2 Timothy 3:1-2). As we approach the end of time, the contrast between the self-seeking nature of the world and the self-sacrificing nature of Christ’s followers will become more distinct.

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangents: • The contrast between the "Way of Cain" (self-preservation/pride) and the Way of the Cross • Lucifer’s fall began with selfishness ("I will ascend"), while Christ’s victory was achieved through self-emptying ("He humbled Himself") • The "Royal Law" (James 2:8) is the law of the Kingdom; selfishness is the law of the rebellion.

Question: How can we overcome the sin of selfishness?

Biblical Answer: “For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead: and that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them...” (2 Corinthians 5:14-15)

Explanation: We cannot overcome selfishness by mere willpower. It is the "love of Christ" that "constraineth" (compels/grips) us. When we realize He became poor so that we might be rich (2 Corinthians 8:9), our hearts are changed to live for Him rather than ourselves.

[ILL] Paul offers himself as a pattern of this victory: "Not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved" (1 Corinthians 10:33). Like a man holding a lifeboat steady for others to board, the Christian seeks the salvation of others above their own comfort.

Question: What is the final result of a life governed by selfishness?

Biblical Answer: “Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain... clouds they are without water... trees whose fruit withereth... to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.” (Jude 11-13)

Practical Application: In what areas do we need to deny self today? • In our finances (giving to the poor vs. hoarding) • In our relationships (seeking to understand vs. needing to be right) • In our time (serving others vs. pleasing ourselves). The call is to look "not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others" (Philippians 2:4).
