---

Slide 1 Question: How are we commanded to treat the Sabbath day?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” (Exodus 20:8)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The command is two-fold: to "remember" a day easily forgotten in the rush of life, and to "keep it holy." We do not *make* it holy; God made it holy at Creation.

---

Slide 4 Explanation (Continued): Our duty is to preserve that holiness by refraining from common labor and dedicating the time to God.

Slide 5 Question: When does the Sabbath actually begin and end according to the Bible?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “From even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.” (Leviticus 23:32)
“...at even, at the going down of the sun.” (Deuteronomy 16:6)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: In Scripture, a day does not begin at midnight. It begins at sunset ("even"). Just as in Creation, "the evening and the morning were the first day" (Genesis 1:5).

Slide 8 Conclusion on Time: Therefore, the Sabbath begins Friday evening at sunset and concludes Saturday evening at sunset.

---

Slide 9 [DYK]: In Mark 1:32, the people waited until "at even, when the sun did set" to bring the sick to Jesus for healing, because they understood the Sabbath ended at sunset.

---

Slide 10 [SN] The Theological Rhythm of Time: God reckons the day starting with evening (rest/darkness) followed by morning (activity/light). This suggests that we rest in God first before we can work effectively. We begin our day by resting in His provision.

Slide 11 Question: What kind of work is appropriate for the six working days, and what is excluded from the Sabbath?

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work.” (Exodus 20:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a carpenter planing wood, focusing on the dignity of labor during the week.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The command distinguishes between "thy work" (secular labor, career, housework, personal gain) and God's work. "Thy work" is to be done during the six days.

Slide 14 Question: Is all activity forbidden on the Sabbath?

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days.” (Matthew 12:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus Christ gently healing a man with a withered hand, surrounded by onlookers.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Jesus clarified that the Sabbath was not meant to stop acts of mercy. Helping the sick, relieving suffering, or caring for basic needs (like an ox in a ditch) is "doing well."

---

Slide 17 [ILL]: Think of the difference between a doctor running a clinic for profit (business) and a doctor stopping to help an injured person on the roadside (mercy). The first is "thy work"; the second is the work of God, which is lawful on the Sabbath.

Slide 18 Question: How should we handle food and household duties?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a kitchen area with stone jars, grain, and a fire for cooking.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Bake that which ye will bake today, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.” (Exodus 16:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Israelite women busily preparing food near their tents while the sun is still high.

---

Slide 20 Term Definition: **"Seethe"** is an older English term meaning to boil or stew.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: God instructed the Israelites to prepare their food on the sixth day (Friday) so that the Sabbath would not be spent in cooking and cleaning. This renders the Sabbath a day of freedom from household burdens.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prepared table set with food, with no fire burning, signifying readiness and rest.

---

Slide 22 [DYK]: The manna provided a weekly double-miracle: On Fridays, they gathered double, and on Sabbath, the leftovers did not spoil—something that happened on no other day of the week.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of baskets overflowing with clean white manna, sitting unspoiled in a tent.

---

Slide 23 Question: Is the Sabbath merely for staying home, or is it a time for gathering?

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “The seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, a holy convocation.” (Leviticus 23:3)
“And He came to Nazareth... and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day...” (Luke 4:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing in a synagogue, holding an open scroll, preparing to read.

---

Slide 25 Term Definition & Explanation: **"Convocation"** means a commanded assembly. While it is a day of rest, it is also a day for community worship. Jesus set the example by making it His "custom" to be in God's house.

Slide 26 Question: What should be our heart attitude while observing the Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking upward with a peaceful, joyful expression, soft light illuminating their face.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable...” (Isaiah 58:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll of Isaiah open, with golden light highlighting the text.

---

Slide 28 Explanation: This verse describes a shift in focus. We turn away from "our pleasure" (hobbies, business) to find "delight" in God's presence. It is not a day of gloom, but an "honorable" appointment with the Creator.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family walking in a garden or nature, looking happy and connected with God.

---

Slide 29 [SN] "Turn away thy foot": This idiom suggests that in our daily walk, we are treading on common ground. When we reach the Sabbath hours, we must stop and realize we are stepping onto holy ground—much like Moses at the burning bush.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses removing his sandals before the burning bush, showing reverence.

---

Slide 30 Deeper Insight: The Sabbath is the bridge between the spiritual and the physical. By observing a specific time in a specific manner, we acknowledge that God is the owner of our time and the sustainer of our lives.

---

Slide 31 Practical Application: How can we make the Sabbath a delight today?
• **Preparation:** Finish tasks on Friday to ensure peace.
• **Nature:** Spend time in God's creation.
• **Service:** Visit the sick or discouraged.
• **Disconnect:** Turn off secular media to tune into God.
