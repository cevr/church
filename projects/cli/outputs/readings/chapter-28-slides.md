Study Title: Bible Sanctification: Wholeness in Christ

---

Slide 1 Question: What is God’s specific will concerning the condition of His people?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For this is the will of God, even your sanctification.” (1 Thessalonians 4:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open scroll resting on a wooden table, with the words of scripture faintly visible, bathed in a shaft of warm sunlight.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God’s plan for humanity is not merely forgiveness, but transformation. He desires "sanctification," a process of being set apart for holy use and made pure in character.

---

Slide 4 Word Definition: **Sanctification** (*Greek: hagiasmos*)
Meaning: Purification, consecration, or holiness. It implies a state of being distinct from the world and dedicated entirely to God.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of temple vessels set aside on a stone altar, gold and silver gleaming softly in candlelight, symbolizing items set apart for holy use.

---

Slide 5 Question: Is it possible for a person to accomplish this work of holiness by themselves?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lone traveler attempting to climb a steep, rocky cliff in shadows, looking weary and unable to proceed.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.” (John 15:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lush vineyard, focusing on a thick grape vine with strong branches bearing heavy clusters of purple grapes, bathed in warm afternoon sun.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Just as a branch cannot generate life if severed from the trunk, a human being cannot generate true holiness apart from Christ. Moral improvement without Jesus is merely behavioral modification; sanctification is the infusion of His life into ours.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a severed branch lying on the dry ground, withered and brown, contrasted with the green, living vine above it.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Glove
On its own, a glove is limp and powerless. But when a hand fills the glove, it becomes active and useful. We are the glove; Christ is the Hand.

[ILL] Consider a glove. On its own, a glove is limp and powerless to pick up a Bible or help a neighbor. But when a hand fills the glove, it becomes active and useful. We are the glove; Christ is the Hand.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting style still life of a simple leather worker's glove lying on a wooden table next to a hammer, soft lighting emphasizing the texture.

---

Slide 9 Question: Through what medium or instrument does God perform this work in us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person sitting in a quiet room, holding a scroll with an expression of deep contemplation and seeking.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing with his disciples, teaching them with a scroll in hand, soft light radiating from the scriptures.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Sanctification is not a mystical feeling; it is an intelligent process brought about by the Word of God. As we receive, believe, and obey the Truth, the Truth changes us.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** This highlights the Protestant principle of *Sola Scriptura*. The Holy Spirit works *through* the Word, not independently of it. In the pioneer view, the more we understand the Bible, the more materials the Holy Spirit has to build a holy character within us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe carefully writing on parchment, focused and reverent, surrounded by books and scrolls in a study.

---

Slide 12 Question: How much of the individual does true sanctification affect?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing in a field, arms open, representing the whole self—body, mind, and spirit—under the open sky.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beam of light descending from heaven, encompassing a person completely from head to toe in a gentle glow.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Biblical religion covers the entire person. It is not limited to our thoughts or prayers; it includes our physical habits, our health, and our intellect.

[DYK] The concept of the "whole man" is central to the biblical understanding of human nature. Unlike Greek philosophy, which often viewed the body as a prison for the soul, Scripture views the body as the temple of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, caring for one's health is a spiritual duty.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a physician in biblical times tending to a patient with care, symbolizing the value of the physical body.

---

Slide 15 Question: How does this affect our daily choices, such as eating and drinking?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple wooden table set with bread, fruit, and a pitcher of water, arranged beautifully in natural light.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family gathered around a meal, bowing their heads in gratitude before eating, soft light creating an atmosphere of reverence.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: Holiness is practical. It sits at the dinner table with us. If our bodies are to be "presented a living sacrifice" (Romans 12:1), then what we consume matters because it affects the brain—the very medium through which God communicates with us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person offering a basket of firstfruits at an altar, symbolizing the offering of one's daily life and sustenance to God.

---

Slide 18 Question: What creates the condition for this change? How are we transformed?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man looking at his reflection in a pool of water, but the reflection shows a brighter, more peaceful countenance than his current face.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.” (Romans 12:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person walking away from a crowded, chaotic city gate toward a peaceful, light-filled mountain path.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: The battle for sanctification is fought in the mind. By refusing to pattern ourselves after the world and allowing God to "renew" our thoughts, our external actions change naturally.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a close-up of a furrowed brow relaxing into peace, symbolizing the internal renewing of the mind.

---

Slide 21 Word Definition: **Transformed** (*Greek: metamorphoo*)
This word describes a radical change of nature. It is the root of our word "metamorphosis"—like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a butterfly resting on a flower, its wings vibrant and new, contrasting with a leafy background.

---

Slide 22 Question: What is the cost of becoming a true disciple?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rich young ruler walking away sorrowfully, while a disciple in the background drops his fishing nets to follow Jesus.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.” (Luke 14:33)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of hands held open and empty, lifted upward, signifying the release of all possessions and self-will.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Sanctification requires total surrender. We cannot hold on to cherished sins or worldly ambitions and hold on to Christ at the same time. We must empty our hands of self so they can be filled with Him.

[SN] **Deeper Insight:** This "forsaking all" often includes a reordering of affections. As Matthew 10:37 notes, our love for Christ must exceed our love for father, mother, or children. This doesn't mean we love our family less, but that our love for them is purified and sustained by our supreme love for God.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a merchant selling all his pearls to buy one pearl of great price, holding the single pearl with reverence.

---

Slide 25 Question: If we surrender all and face difficulties, is our connection to God secure?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small boat in a storm, tossed by waves, but anchored securely to a rock beneath the water.

---

Slide 26 Biblical Answer: “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life... nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd holding a lamb securely in his arms during a dark, windy night, protecting it from the elements.

---

Slide 27 Explanation: While the standard of holiness is high, the security of the believer is found in the love of God. Sanctification is a lifelong journey, and as long as we abide in Him, no external force can sever that bond.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden chain with unbreakable links, glowing softly, symbolizing the eternal bond of God's love.

---

Slide 28 Practical Application:
1. **Abide:** Are you connecting with the Vine daily?
2. **Study:** Are you spending time in the Word?
3. **Surrender:** Is there a habit you need to "forsake"?
