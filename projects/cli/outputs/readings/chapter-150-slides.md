Study Title: Where is Your Treasure? The Bible on Wealth and Giving

---

Slide 1 Question: How does God view the attitude of covetousness (the greedy desire to possess)?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth.” (Psalm 10:3)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The language here is strong. While the world may congratulate someone for accumulating vast wealth at any cost, God looks at the heart. To "abhor" means to regard with disgust.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, wealth was often seen as a sign of divine favor, yet the Hebrew prophets frequently warned that how one *obtained* and *used* wealth mattered more than the wealth itself.

---

Slide 4 Insight: Covetousness is dangerous because it often replaces trust in God with trust in material things.

Slide 5 Question: Where does the ability to earn a living actually come from?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.” (Deuteronomy 8:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of divine hands gently passing a sheaf of grain and tools into the waiting hands of a man.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: We often credit our hard work, education, or cleverness for our success. Scripture reminds us that the very strength, health, and opportunity to work are gifts from God.

[ILL] A manager of a store handles large amounts of money daily, but he knows the money does not belong to him—it belongs to the owner. He is responsible for how it is used. In the same way, we are managers of God’s resources.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a steward organizing goods in a storehouse, holding a ledger, signifying management rather than ownership.

---

Slide 8 Question: What warning did Jesus give regarding the accumulation of possessions?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing among a crowd, raising a hand in warning, soft light illuminating his face.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness; for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.” (Luke 12:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rich man sitting amidst overflowing baskets and chests, yet looking lonely and spiritually empty.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Jesus teaches that "life"—real, meaningful, spiritual existence—is not defined by how much we own.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single lit candle in a simple room, contrasting with a dark room filled with cluttered, unlit lamps.

---

Slide 11 Insight: The Parable of the Rich Fool illustrates this truth. The man built bigger barns to store his crops, only to lose his soul that very night. He was rich in goods, but not "rich toward God" (Luke 12:21).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of large wooden barns being constructed under a twilight sky, with a sense of foreboding shadows.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: “High-minded” (1 Timothy 6:17). This refers to arrogance or pride. Wealth often tempts people to feel superior or self-sufficient, forgetting their need for God.

---

Slide 13 Question: What are those with means instructed to do with their resources?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wealthy merchant handing a loaf of bread and a coin to a kneeling beggar, soft compassionate light.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.” (1 Timothy 6:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a community gathering where people are sharing fruits, bread, and garments with one another openly.

---

Slide 15 Progressive Disclosure:
*   **Do good:** Wealth is an active tool for service.
*   **Ready to distribute:** Being generous without compulsion.
*   **Willing to communicate:** To share or have fellowship through giving.

[SN] Early Adventist pioneers often lived by the principle of "systematic benevolence." They believed that if God gave the power to acquire means, those means should be used to spread the Gospel and help the needy, viewing their resources as fuel for the mission rather than for personal luxury.

---

Slide 16 Question: Does God value the size of the gift or the heart of the giver?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a balance scale, with a small copper coin on one side weighing more than a bag of gold on the other.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.” (2 Corinthians 8:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Widow's Mite, a poor woman dropping two small coins into a temple treasury box, observed by Jesus.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: God is fair. The value of the offering is measured by the "willing mind"—the spirit of sacrifice—rather than the dollar amount.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a simple clay altar with a small flame burning brightly, symbolizing a sincere offering.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: This principle transforms giving from a tax into an act of worship. A small gift from a person of limited means, given with love, is valued just as highly by heaven as a large gift from the wealthy.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a beam of light shining down on a pair of weathered, praying hands holding a small offering.

---

Slide 20 Question: What happens to our hearts when we invest in God’s work?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking intently at a treasure chest, but the chest is transparent and reveals a glowing heart inside.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” (Luke 12:34)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a path leading from a village upward toward a glowing city in the clouds, representing heavenly investment.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: This is a profound psychological and spiritual truth: our affections follow our investments. If we hoard money on earth, our hearts are tied to earth. If we invest in God’s work, our hearts become knit to heaven.

[ILL] If you buy stock in a specific company, you immediately become interested in its success. You check the news about it; you care about its future. Similarly, when we "buy stock" in God's Kingdom through our offerings, our interest and affection naturally shift toward spiritual things.

Slide 23 Practical Application:
*   **Review our attitude:** Do we hold our possessions loosely or tightly?
*   **Acknowledge the Source:** Thank God for the "power to get wealth."
*   **Transfer funds:** Move "treasure" from earth to heaven by supporting the needy or the gospel work.

[SN] Expanding on the "bags which wax not old" (Luke 12:33): Scott's commentary notes that earthly wealth is like putting money in a "bag with holes." Inflation, decay, and death eventually drain it all. Generosity is the only way to secure treasure in a place where it can never be lost.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open hand releasing a bird that flies upward toward the light, symbolizing the release of earthly hold for heavenly gain.
