Study Title: The Atonement and the Heavenly Sanctuary

---

Slide 1 Question: At the moment of Christ's death, what miraculous event signaled that the earthly temple service was no longer necessary?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Jesus, when He had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom." (Matthew 27:50, 51)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The tearing of the heavy curtain separated the Holy from the Most Holy place. This signified the end of the earthly sacrificial system. Human priests and animal sacrifices were no longer needed, for the true Lamb of God had died.

[DYK] The veil in the temple was thick and heavy. For it to tear "from the top to the bottom" implies it was not torn by human hands, but by the hand of God, signifying He was opening the way to His presence for all.

Slide 4 Question: If the earthly service is finished, where does Jesus carry out His work as our High Priest now?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such a High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens." (Hebrews 8:1)

Slide 6 The Reality of Ministry:
*   **Who is the Minister?** Christ, a High Priest of "good things to come" (Heb 9:11).
*   **Where is the Sanctuary?** The "true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man" (Heb 8:2).
*   **Why not on earth?** His ministry belongs to the heavenly reality, not the earthly shadow (Heb 8:4).

Slide 7 Term Definition: **"Shadow" vs. "Substance"**

The text describes the earthly service as a "shadow of heavenly things" (Heb 8:5). A shadow gives a rough outline of the object casting it, but it is not the object itself. The earthly rituals were the outline; Christ's ministry in heaven is the reality.

[ILL] Think of an architect's model of a house. The model is useful to understand the design, but you cannot live in it. The earthly sanctuary was the model; the heavenly sanctuary is the true house where salvation is fully realized.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shadow cast on the ground of a priest, while the real figure stands in bright light, emphasizing the difference between outline and reality.

---

Slide 8 Question: Does the heavenly sanctuary have specific apartments and furniture like the earthly one did?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the interior of the earthly sanctuary, focusing on the golden furniture and the curtain, historically respectful.

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of His testament." (Revelation 11:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the heavenly temple opened, revealing the Ark of the Covenant glowing with brilliant, pure light.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Just as the earthly sanctuary had a Most Holy Place containing the Ark of the Covenant (testament), the heavenly sanctuary contains the original Ark.

[SN] The presence of the Ark in heaven confirms that God’s Law (the Ten Commandments kept inside the Ark) is eternal and immutable. It rests beneath His throne as the foundation of His government, distinct from the ceremonial laws of sacrifice which ceased at the cross.

Slide 11 Question: The earthly sanctuary had to be cleansed once a year (on the Day of Atonement). Is it necessary for the heavenly sanctuary to be cleansed as well?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a High Priest in ancient Israel performing a solemn ritual with incense and blood, atmospheric and reverent.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these." (Hebrews 9:23)

---

Slide 13 Deeper Insight:
The text states that the "heavenly things" must be purified by the blood of Christ. This points to a specific time of judgment and the final removal of sin from the record.

**The Parallel:**
*   **Type (Earthly):** The Day of Atonement was the day sins were separated from the camp.
*   **Antitype (Heavenly):** Christ performs a final work to "put away sin" (Heb 9:26) before He returns.

Slide 14 Question: How does the Bible describe the final removal of these sins?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a repentant sinner looking upward, light breaking through clouds above them.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord." (Acts 3:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a hand gently blotting out writing on a parchment scroll, leaving the page clean and white.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Sins are recorded until they are "blotted out." This blotting out precedes the return of Jesus (Acts 3:20). It is the final act of the Atonement process.

---

Slide 17 Question: In the earthly service, the High Priest placed the sins on a "scapegoat." How is this fulfilled in the plan of salvation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a goat being led away into a desolate wilderness, sunset lighting, solitary and dramatic.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for Him shall He appear the second time without sin unto salvation." (Hebrews 9:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ on the cross, bearing the weight of the world, portrayed with dignity and sorrow.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: Christ bore the penalty of our sins on the Cross. However, the Day of Atonement type shows that after the priestly work finishes, the guilt is placed on the head of the scapegoat (representing Satan).

[ILL] Imagine a courtroom. The defendant is acquitted because a benefactor paid the fine. The record is cleared. But the one who instigated the crime (the mastermind) must still bear the responsibility for causing the trouble. Christ pays our debt; Satan, the originator of evil, eventually bears the responsibility for the existence of sin.

Slide 20 Question: What decision is made regarding God's people before the resurrection occurs?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of sleeping saints in their graves, soft light hinting at an approaching dawn.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead...” (Luke 20:35)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of angels examining the book of life, a sense of solemnity and joy.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Before the dead are raised at Christ's coming, they must be "accounted worthy." This implies an investigation or judgment takes place *prior* to the Second Coming to determine who will be part of the "resurrection of the just."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a balance scale, tipped in favor by the blood of Christ, signifying worthiness through Grace.

---

Slide 23 Question: Is there a specific time prophecy related to this cleansing of the sanctuary?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel looking at a vision in the night sky, stars arranged in a prophetic pattern.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." (Daniel 8:14)

**Note:** The text clarifies that this vision belongs to "the time of the end" (Daniel 8:17), indicating this cleansing is a latter-day work of Christ in heaven.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an hourglass with sand running out, illuminated by a divine light, signifying the time of the end.

---

Slide 25 Practical Application: Since we have a High Priest making intercession for us, how should we live?

1.  **Confidence:** We can approach God knowing Jesus is our Representative.
2.  **Cleansing:** We should seek to have our sins "blotted out" through repentance now.
3.  **Hope:** We look forward to Him appearing "the second time without sin unto salvation."
