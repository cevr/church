---

Slide 1 Question: What is the fundamental assurance given to everyone who believes in Jesus?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus speaking with Nicodemus at night, a single oil lamp glowing between them, highlighting the earnest expression of the Savior.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: This is the bedrock of the Gospel. The text establishes a stark contrast: perishing versus living forever. The condition for this life is not earning it, but believing in the One who gave it.

---

Slide 4 Insight: [DYK] The Greek word for "believeth" in this text implies a continuous action—"whosoever goes on believing." It describes a living, ongoing trust rather than a one-time intellectual assent.

Slide 5 Question: What is revealed through the Gospel message regarding how we live?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.” (Romans 1:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul writing an epistle by candlelight, surrounded by parchment, with a look of deep inspiration.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The Gospel brings "righteousness" (right doing and right being) to light. The scripture emphasizes that spiritual life is sustained by faith from start to finish.

[SN] Use of "The just shall live by faith": This text was the catalyst for the Protestant Reformation. For the SDA pioneer, this speaks to the "Third Angel's Message" in verity—justification by faith is the work of God in man, fitting him for glory.

---

Slide 8 Question: How closely are "righteousness" and "life" connected in Scripture?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two intertwined vines growing together, inseparable and full of fruit.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.” (Proverbs 12:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lush, green pathway lined with blooming trees, leading toward a brilliant, life-giving city in the distance.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: We often view righteousness as rules and "eternal life" as a reward. Solomon suggests they are the same thing. To be in the way of righteousness *is* to be in the way of life. Sin is the mechanism of death; righteousness is the mechanism of life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King Solomon seated on his throne, deep in thought, holding a quill and parchment.

---

Slide 11 Illustration: [ILL] Consider a fish in water. The water is the "righteous environment" for the fish. To stay in the water is life; to leave it is death. God’s righteousness is the atmosphere in which human beings were designed to exist.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a clear river teeming with life, fish swimming gracefully in the current, dappled sunlight filtering through the water.

---

Slide 12 Question: Since we have sinned, we cannot generate this righteousness ourselves. Who is the Source?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man kneeling in a barren desert, looking up with empty hands, acknowledging his need.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “And this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.” (Jeremiah 23:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Prophet Jeremiah prophesying to the people, pointing toward the future coming of the Messiah.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: We do not produce righteousness; we receive a Person who *is* Righteousness. Jeremiah predicts the coming of Christ, noting that His very name identifies Him as the supply of our needs.

---

Slide 15 Term Definition: **"Imputed Righteousness"** – This is a theological term meaning that Christ’s perfect history is credited to our account. We are treated as if we had lived His perfect life.

---

Slide 16 Question: If Christ is our Righteousness, what is the standard or definition of that righteousness?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a measuring reed or a plumb line set against a wall, symbolizing a perfect standard.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “All Thy commandments are righteousness.” (Psalm 119:172)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the two stone tablets of the Ten Commandments resting on a wooden table, illuminated by a soft, holy glow.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The Ten Commandments are not arbitrary rules; they are a transcript of God’s character. If God is righteous, His law describes what that righteousness looks like in action.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an open heaven, with the light of God's presence reflecting onto the written law below.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: There is perfect harmony between the Law and the Gospel. The Law reveals the standard of righteousness (Psalm 119:172), and the Gospel provides the power to meet that standard through Jesus (Romans 1:16).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wooden cross standing behind the stone tablets, the shadow of the cross falling over the law, symbolizing harmony.

---

Slide 20 Question: How do we receive this experience of righteousness and life? Is it a wage we earn?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a laborer receiving coins in his hand after a day of work, contrasted with a king offering a free gift.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding out a radiant crown of life, offering it freely with a gesture of grace.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: A wage is something you are owed because you worked for it. The only thing humanity has "earned" is death. Eternal life is a "gift." You cannot work for a gift; you can only accept it with gratitude.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The concept of the "Gift." In the Sanctuary service, the sinner brought a lamb. The sinner did not kill himself for his sin; the lamb took the death. The life of the lamb was accepted in place of the sinner.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sacrificial lamb on an altar, peaceful and white, symbolizing the innocent taking the place of the guilty.

---

Slide 23 Question: How does this gift actually change our hearts and behavior?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a human heart glowing from within, transforming from stone to flesh.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: "Christ is the source of every right impulse... And as Christ draws them to look upon His cross... the commandment comes home to the conscience... They begin to comprehend something of the righteousness of Christ." (*Steps to Christ*, p. 30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer gazing intently at the crucifixion, tears of realization and repentance on their face.

---

Slide 25 Explanation: We do not change our habits *in order* to come to Christ; we come to Christ, and His love changes our habits. As we look at the Cross ("beholding the Lamb"), we realize the cost of sin. This goodness of God leads us to repentance.

---

Slide 26 Illustration: **The Magnet.** A piece of iron does not need to struggle to move toward a magnet; it simply yields to the pull. Jesus said, "If I be lifted up... I will draw all men unto me." His love is the magnet. Our part is to stop resisting the pull.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus with arms wide open, a subtle visual effect of light drawing people toward Him from the shadows.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application:

*   **Assurance**: Do you doubt your standing? "The Lord is our Righteousness." It depends on Him.
*   **Action**: Struggling with sin? Turn on the "Light" by beholding Christ in the Word.
*   **Hope**: The path of righteousness has "no death" in it. Our life is hid with Christ.
