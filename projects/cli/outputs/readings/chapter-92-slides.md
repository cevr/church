---

Slide 1 Question: Against what specific danger does the third angel warn the world in the last days?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The final warning of Scripture is a call to loyalty. It warns against a counterfeit system of worship and a false sign of allegiance. This implies a conflict between the authority of God and the authority of man.

---

Slide 4 Question: In contrast to those who worship the beast, how does the Bible describe God’s faithful people?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

---

Slide 6 Term Definition: **Patience** (*Greek: hupomone*)
Meaning: Steadfast endurance or staying power under pressure. These believers remain loyal when the majority of the world compromises.

---

Slide 7 Illustration: Imagine a soldier standing at his post while an entire army retreats past him. The "patience of the saints" is that kind of spiritual standing—holding fast to God's law when the world moves in a different direction.

---

Slide 8 Question: Instead of the "mark" of the beast, what do God’s loyal servants receive?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a divine hand gently touching the forehead of a kneeling servant, a soft glow emanating from the touch.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.” (Revelation 7:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of four angels at the corners of the earth holding back wind and storms, waiting for the sealing work to finish.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: God places His own "seal" upon His people. This is an act of claiming ownership and providing protection.

[DYK] In ancient times, a king’s seal gave a document the force of law. A valid royal seal always contained three elements:
1. The Name of the King.
2. His Title.
3. The Territory over which he ruled.

Slide 11 Question: Where is God’s seal found?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Isaiah writing intently on a long scroll in a study room filled with soft, golden light.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Bind up the testimony, seal the law among My disciples.” (Isaiah 8:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rolled scroll being tied with a cord and secured with a wax seal.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The seal is connected to God's Law. If we look at the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20), we must search for the commandment that contains the three elements of a seal: Name, Title, and Territory.

*   The first commandment mentions God, but not His domain.
*   The fifth mentions the Lord, but applies to parents.
*   Only one validates the authority of the entire Law.

Slide 14 Question: Which commandment contains the seal of God—identifying His Name, Title, and Territory?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses holding the tablets, with a beam of light specifically illuminating the center of the fourth commandment.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the **Lord thy God [Name]**... for in six days the **Lord made [Title: Creator]** **heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is [Territory]**...” (Exodus 20:10, 11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting the creation of the world—earth, sky, and sea—blended artistically with Hebrew text.

---

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: The Sabbath commandment is the only one that points out *who* the true God is—the Creator. Anyone could claim to be a god, but only the One who created the heavens and the earth has the right to supreme worship. Therefore, the Sabbath is the "seal" of His authority.

---

Slide 17 Speaker Note: The Sabbath is not just a memorial of creation; it is a sign of sanctification.
*"I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them."* (Ezekiel 20:12)
Just as God set the day apart (made it holy), He sets His people apart.

Slide 18 Question: Has man attempted to change God's Law and His seal?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of ancient scribes and bishops in a council room, debating over scrolls, shadows casting a serious mood.

---

Slide 19 Historical Evidence:
*   **Catholic admission:** "The Church chose Sunday... and in the course of time added other days, as holy days." (*Vincent J. Kelly*)
*   **Protestant admission:** "There is no scriptural evidence of the change of the Sabbath institution from the seventh to the first day of the week." (*Dr. E. T. Hiscox, Baptist Manual*)

---

Slide 20 Progressive Disclosure:
*   The Beast power asserts authority by changing the Law.
*   The Mark is a sign of allegiance to this changed authority.
*   The Seal is allegiance to the Creator’s authority.

[ILL] If a governor changes a law signed by the King, and citizens obey the governor over the King, whose authority are they actually honoring?

Slide 21 Question: What is the final reward for those who get the victory over the beast and his mark?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a glorious vision of heaven, with a shimmering surface resembling glass and fire.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory... stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.” (Revelation 15:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a multitude of people in white robes standing on a translucent, glowing floor, holding golden harps.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: The faithful are not only saved; they are victorious. They stood firm on the "sea of glass" because they refused to stand on the shifting sands of human tradition.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: Loyalty is tested in the details.
*   Do we follow tradition or Truth?
*   Do we fear earthly pressure or love the Lamb?
*   Are we willing to let God "seal" our minds with His truth?

Slide 25 Conclusion: God is calling for a people who will keep His commandments out of love and faith in Jesus.
