Study Title: Evidences of Acceptance with God

Question: Since our natural human nature is opposed to God, how can we be accepted by Him?

Biblical Answer: “In every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.” (Acts 10:35). However, because the carnal mind is enmity against God (Rom. 8:7), a change is required: “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God.” (1 Peter 1:23)

Explanation: The text presents a dilemma: God accepts righteousness, but humans are naturally unrighteous. The solution is the "New Birth." We cannot change our own nature; it requires a supernatural act where the Holy Spirit uses the Word of God to create a "new creature" (2 Cor. 5:17).

[DYK] The phrase "born again" in Greek (*anothen*) can mean both "born again" and "born from above." This highlights that our spiritual life must have a heavenly origin, not an earthly one.

Term Definition: "Carnal mind" refers to the natural, unrenewed human disposition which seeks self-interest rather than God's will.

Question: Is this acceptance and forgiveness something we earn, or is it a gift?

Biblical Answer: “In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace.” (Eph. 1:7)

Explanation: Forgiveness is not a wage paid for work done; it is a "pure act of grace." The prodigal son in Luke 15 returned home feeling unworthy to be a son, yet the Father received him fully. We are accepted not because of our merit, but because of the merit of Jesus.

[ILL] Imagine a person drowning in debt. If a benefactor pays the debt off, the debtor is free. The debtor did not "earn" the freedom by worrying or promising to be better; they simply received the payment made by another. This is justification by faith.

Deeper Insight: Faith itself is not a "work" that merits reward. Faith is simply the hand that reaches out to accept what Christ has already provided. All the merit resides in the Giver (Christ), not the receiver.

Question: How can a believer be sure of this relationship with God?

Biblical Answer: “The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God.” (Rom. 8:16) “Hereby know we that we dwell in Him, and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit.” (1 John 4:13)

Explanation: God does not leave His children in doubt. He provides an internal witness through the Holy Spirit. This relationship changes from Judge/Accused to Father/Child.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit-led expansion: • The concept of "Adoption" in Roman law, which was absolute and irreversible • The "witness" of the Spirit as an internal conviction that withstands external doubt • The parallels between the "Spirit of Truth" and the "Spirit of Prophecy" guiding the church.

Question: What are the internal and external evidences that a person has been truly converted?

Biblical Answer: **Internal:** “For I delight in the law of God after the inward man.” (Rom. 7:22). **External:** “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Gal. 5:22, 23)

Progressive Disclosure: • Peace with God • Delight in God's Law • Visible character change (Fruit)

[ILL] You identify a tree by its fruit, not by the label on its trunk. A person may claim to be a Christian (the label), but the fruit (character and obedience) reveals the true nature of the tree.

Term Definition: "Delight in the law" indicates a change of heart. The unconverted person sees God's law as a restriction or a burden; the converted person sees it as a transcript of the Father's character and loves it.

Question: Can we produce this righteous fruit by our own effort?

Biblical Answer: “As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in Me.” (John 15:4)

Explanation: Just as a branch severed from the trunk instantly begins to die and cannot produce grapes, a Christian separated from daily communion with Christ cannot produce the fruit of the Spirit. Acceptance is sustained by "abiding"—a continuous, living connection.

[SN] Tangent on "Abiding": This relates to the "burning heart" experience of the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24:32). It is the opening of the Scriptures and the presence of Jesus that fuels the spiritual life.

Practical Application: How do I check my own spiritual condition today? • Do I have peace even in trouble? • Do I delight in God's instructions or resent them? • am I trying to produce fruit by effort, or by spending time with Jesus? • Invite Jesus to "sup" with you today (Rev 3:20).
