Study Title: True Riches: Stewardship and the Heart

Question: Where does the ability to acquire wealth actually come from?

Biblical Answer: “But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God; for it is He that giveth thee power to get wealth.” (Deut. 8:18)

Explanation: It is easy to attribute financial success to our own intelligence, hard work, or business acumen. However, Scripture reminds us that the very energy, health, and mental capacity required to work are gifts from God. We are not independent owners, but stewards of what He has entrusted to us.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, it was common to attribute prosperity to the favor of local deities or personal strength. Deuteronomy 8 was a radical reminder to Israel that their upcoming prosperity in Canaan was entirely dependent on Yahweh, the Creator.

Question: What caution does the Bible give when our wealth begins to grow?

Biblical Answer: “If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.” (Psalm 62:10)

Explanation: The danger lies not in the riches themselves, but in the position they occupy in our hearts. When wealth increases, the natural human tendency is to feel secure and self-sufficient, slowly displacing trust in God with trust in a bank account.

[ILL] Consider the Dead Sea. It receives water from the Jordan River but has no outlet; it keeps everything to itself. As a result, the water is stagnant and supports no life. In contrast, the Sea of Galilee receives and gives water, and it teems with life. Wealth that is hoarded stagnates the soul; wealth that flows out in service brings life.

Question: What are the specific dangers of pursuing wealth as a primary goal?

Biblical Answer: “But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.” (1 Tim. 6:9)

Term Definition: “Snare” refers to a trap used to catch animals. The pursuit of money often acts as a trap because it promises freedom but often leads to bondage—fear of loss, compromising of principles, and a distraction from spiritual realities.

[SN] A note on the "Rich Young Ruler" (Matt 19:21-22): Jesus did not command every person in the Bible to sell everything. He gave this specific command to this young man because He saw that money was the man's idol. The "sore evil" (Eccl 5:13) is when wealth is kept to the "owner's hurt"—when the possession possesses the possessor.

Question: How should those who have resources behave?

Biblical Answer: “That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come...” (1 Tim. 6:18-19)

Explanation: The remedy for the snare of riches is generosity. Being "ready to distribute" means keeping a loose grip on earthly assets so they can be quickly moved to help others or advance God's kingdom. This transforms temporary currency into eternal treasure.

Question: What does the Bible say about the security wealth provides in the final judgment?

Biblical Answer: “Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath.” (Zeph. 1:18)

Explanation: Material wealth is strictly limited to this life. The parable of the rich man who built bigger barns (Luke 12:16-21) illustrates the tragedy of preparing for a long life on earth while remaining "not rich toward God." He made provision for the body but starved the soul.

[SN] Historical Insight: The early Advent believers (Millerites) exemplified this principle in the 1840s. Many farmers sold their fields and crops to print charts and papers to warn the world of Christ's coming. They esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt" (Heb. 11:26), demonstrating that their treasure was truly in heaven.

Question: How does God define someone who is truly "rich"?

Biblical Answer: “Hearken, my beloved brethren; hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which He hath promised to them that love Him?” (James 2:5)

Explanation: True wealth is measured by faith and inheritance in God's kingdom. A person may be poor in currency but a billionaire in faith. Proverbs 10:22 adds, "The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and He addeth no sorrow with it." God’s wealth brings peace, whereas worldly wealth often brings anxiety.

Deeper Insight: The "eternal inheritance" mentioned in Isaiah 64:4 ("neither hath the eye seen... what He hath prepared") suggests that the rewards of faithfulness are beyond human comprehension. We trade the temporary, rusting dust of this earth for the imperishable glory of God's presence.

Practical Application: How do we handle our resources today?
• **Acknowledge Source:** Thank God daily for the ability to work.
• **Check the Heart:** Ask, "Do I own my things, or do they own me?"
• **Practice Generosity:** Be "ready to distribute" to the poor and the cause of God.
• **Prioritize:** Seek to be "rich in faith" above all else.
