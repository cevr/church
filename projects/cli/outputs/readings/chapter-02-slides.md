Study Title: Searching the Scriptures: Christ the Center

---

Slide 1 Question: What instruction did Jesus give regarding the study of the Scriptures?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.” (John 5:39)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient Hebrew scroll unrolled on a wooden table, illuminated by a warm shaft of light, highlighting the text.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: When Jesus spoke these words, the "New Testament" had not yet been written. He was directing the people to the Old Testament. He corrected a common error: the Jewish leaders believed that simply possessing the holy writings gave them eternal life. Jesus clarified that the Scriptures are a guide meant to lead us to Him, the Source of life.

---

Slide 4 Word Study: [DYK] The word translated "search" implies digging deep, like a miner hunting for gold. It suggests that the most valuable truths are not always lying on the surface but require diligent effort to find.

---

Slide 5 Question: Was the "Gospel" (Good News about Jesus) known to people in the Old Testament, such as Abraham?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the patriarch Abraham standing under a starry night sky, looking upward with an expression of deep faith and contemplation.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham...” (Galatians 3:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham making a sacrifice at an altar, firelight glowing against the twilight, symbolizing faith in the coming Redeemer.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The plan of salvation is not a new invention of the New Testament. The Apostle Paul confirms that the very same Gospel we believe today was preached to Abraham. While we look backward to the Cross, the patriarchs looked forward to it through faith and the sacrificial system.

---

Slide 8 Illustration: [ILL] Imagine a long procession. Those at the front of the line (the Patriarchs) and those at the back of the line (us today) are all following the same Leader, even though they view Him from different angles.

Slide 9 Question: Did the Israelites in the wilderness understand that Christ was their Provider?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the camp of Israel in the desert, with tents stretching out to the horizon under the pillar of cloud.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “...and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.” (1 Corinthians 10:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of water gushing abundantly from a large desert rock, with thirsty Israelites gathering around to drink in relief.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The source text reveals a profound truth: The Being who led Israel, provided water from the rock, and offered spiritual sustenance was none other than Christ Himself. Even Moses chose to suffer affliction because he esteemed "the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt" (Hebrews 11:26).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses standing on a ridge, looking back at the people, with a faint, spiritual presence of the pre-incarnate Christ guiding the pillar of fire.

---

Slide 12 Key Definition: "Dispensation" often refers to a period of time in history. While methods of teaching (like symbols and sacrifices) may change between dispensations, the method of salvation—faith in Christ—remains eternal.

---

Slide 13 Speaker Note: [SN] This touches on the "Everlasting Covenant." Early Adventists emphasized that God does not change. The "God of the Old Testament" is not harsh while Jesus is gentle; rather, Jesus *is* the God of the Old Testament, leading His people with patience long before His incarnation.

---

Slide 14 Question: How can the Old Testament help us understand Jesus today?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Philip the Evangelist walking alongside a royal chariot on a dusty desert road.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture [Isaiah], and preached unto him Jesus.” (Acts 8:35)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Philip sitting in the chariot with the Ethiopian eunuch, pointing to a specific passage on a scroll, both faces illuminated by discovery.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: In this account, an Ethiopian traveler was reading the prophet Isaiah but could not understand it. Philip did not tell him to put away the Old Testament; instead, he used that very text to reveal Jesus. The Old Testament is the foundation upon which the New Testament is built (Ephesians 2:20).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an architectural foundation made of large stones, upon which a beautiful temple is being constructed, soft golden hour light.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The Bible is one complete book. The Old Testament is the Gospel concealed in types and shadows; the New Testament is the Gospel revealed in clarity. You cannot fully understand one without the other.

Slide 18 Question: What attitude should we have when studying the Bible?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of people sitting around a table, leaning in with intense focus and interest.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “These [Bereans] were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.” (Acts 17:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of men and women in Berea comparing different scrolls, discussing animatedly but respectfully by candlelight.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: The Bereans are set forth as the model for all Bible students. Their "nobility" came from two traits:
1.  **Openness:** They listened with "readiness of mind."
2.  **Verification:** They did not blindly accept what Paul taught; they "searched the scriptures daily" to prove the truth for themselves.

---

Slide 21 Historical Context: [DYK] In the ancient world, having access to the scrolls daily was a privilege. Today, having a Bible in our own home is a blessing we often overlook.

---

Slide 22 Question: How vital is the Word of God to our spiritual existence?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a loaf of broken bread on a simple wooden table, with a soft, holy glow surrounding it.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.” (Matthew 4:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in the wilderness, rejecting the stones, with a spiritual light emanating from Him representing reliance on the Father.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Just as physical bread sustains the body, God’s Word sustains the soul. We cannot survive spiritually on the "food" we ate yesterday; we need a fresh intake of God's Word daily.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of manna falling on the ground in the morning light, looking like frost or coriander seed.

---

Slide 25 Speaker Note: [SN] Tangent on the "Living Word" vs. "Written Word": Psalm 138:2 says God has magnified His word above His name. The written Word is the vehicle through which we encounter the Living Word (Jesus). Neglecting the Bible is, in effect, neglecting Christ.

---

Slide 26 Practical Application:
*   **Look for Jesus:** In every story, law, and prophecy, ask, "What does this reveal about Christ?"
*   **Daily Diet:** Read Scripture not just for information, but for spiritual survival.
*   **Verify Truth:** Like the Bereans, do not rely solely on what others say; open the Book and see for yourself.
