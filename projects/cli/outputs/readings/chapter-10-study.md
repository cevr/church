Study Title: The Nature and Power of God's Love

Question: In what does the Lord delight?

Biblical Answer: “Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy.” (Micah 7:18)

Explanation: God does not hold grudges. While He notices transgression, His disposition is not one of eagerness to punish, but of joy in showing mercy. He finds pleasure in forgiving the "remnant of his heritage."

[DYK] The name "Micah" literally means "Who is like Yahweh?" The prophet’s own name poses the question that this verse answers: No other god is like Him, specifically because He delights in mercy rather than wrath.

Question: Is God's love limited only to those who are good?

Biblical Answer: “...for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.” (Matthew 5:45)

Explanation: God provides the essentials of life—sunshine, rain, breath, and life itself—to everyone, regardless of their moral standing. His benevolence is universal.

[ILL] Imagine a lighthouse keeper who shines the light not only for the ships he likes, but for every vessel on the sea. The light shines because it is the nature of the lighthouse to shine, just as it is God’s nature to love.

Question: How did God demonstrate the depth of His love while humanity was still sinful?

Biblical Answer: “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” (Romans 5:8)

Explanation: God did not wait for humanity to improve itself before offering a rescue. He "commended" (demonstrated or proved) His love by giving the ultimate gift—His Son—at the moment of our greatest unworthiness.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion: • The Unity of the Father and Son (John 10:30)—it was not a loving Son placating an angry Father, but the Father Himself loving the world through the Son • The concept of the "Everlasting Covenant" • The parallel between Abraham offering Isaac and the Father offering the Son.

Question: What status does this love grant to those who accept it?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God...” (1 John 3:1)

Explanation: We are not merely saved criminals or servants; we are adopted into the family of God. This change of status separates the believer from the world’s understanding, as the world does not know God.

Term Definition: “Abba” (Romans 8:15) is an Aramaic term for "Father," implying deep intimacy, trust, and respect. It indicates that the "spirit of bondage" and fear has been replaced by a spirit of familial closeness.

Question: How does receiving God’s love change the way we treat others?

Biblical Answer: “Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.” (1 John 4:11)

Explanation: God’s love is not a stagnant pool; it is a flowing river. If it has filled our hearts, it must flow out to others. This includes a radical command: to love even our enemies and bless those who curse us (Matthew 5:44).

[ILL] A mirror has no light of its own; it can only shine if it reflects the sun. Likewise, we cannot manufacture divine love; we can only reflect the love God has first shone upon us.

Question: Does God’s love ever include discipline?

Biblical Answer: “As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.” (Revelation 3:19)

Explanation: Correction is a proof of legitimacy. Just as a responsible parent disciplines a child to protect them from harm and guide their character, God chastens us because He loves us too much to leave us in error.

Question: Is our salvation based on our good works or God's mercy?

Biblical Answer: “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us...” (Titus 3:5)

Explanation: We cannot earn God's love or salvation through good behavior. It is entirely an act of mercy and grace, washing and renewing us through the Holy Spirit.

Deeper Insight: The text in Jeremiah 31:3 states, "I have loved thee with an everlasting love." God’s love is not reactive to our daily performance; it existed before we were born and endures through eternity. It is the drawing power that leads us to repentance.

Question: Can anything separate the believer from this love?

Biblical Answer: “For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life... nor things present, nor things to come... shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Romans 8:38-39)

Explanation: The Apostle Paul lists every conceivable dimension—physical, spiritual, present, and future—to assert that God’s grip on His children is unbreakable.

Practical Application: How should we respond to such love today? • Trust under the "shadow of His wings" (Psalm 36:7) • Be zealous and repent if we are being corrected • Extend mercy to someone who has wronged us • Rest in the assurance that we are adopted sons and daughters.
