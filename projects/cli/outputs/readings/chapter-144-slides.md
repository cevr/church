Study Title: The Ordinance of Humility: Greatness Through Service

---

Slide 1 Question: At the Last Supper, while the disciples were concerned with who would be the greatest, how did Jesus define true leadership?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them... But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.” (Luke 22:25-26)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The world defines power by how many people serve you. Jesus defines power by how many people you serve. While the disciples were likely arguing over seat assignments (seeking status), Jesus taught that in His Kingdom, the hierarchy is inverted.

[DYK] In the first century, dining tables (tricliniums) were U-shaped. The position of the guests relative to the host indicated their rank and importance. The disciples' dispute was likely over who would sit at Jesus' right and left hands.

Slide 4 Question: How did Jesus physically demonstrate this principle of humility?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “He riseth from supper, and laid aside His garments; and took a towel, and girded Himself... and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded.” (John 13:4-5)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Jesus voluntarily assumed the position of the lowest servant. In a house without a dedicated slave, guests might wash their own feet, but peers rarely washed one another's feet. By doing this, the Creator of the universe served His creation.

[ILL] Imagine the CEO of a massive corporation leaving the boardroom meeting, taking off his suit jacket, and getting on his knees to scrub the mud off the shoes of his junior employees. This is a faint picture of what the King of Glory did.

Slide 7 Question: When Peter refused to let Jesus wash his feet, what was Jesus’ solemn warning?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter pulling his feet back in shock and protest, looking down at Jesus who is kneeling before him.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with Me.” (John 13:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus looking up at Peter with a serious, loving, and intense expression, emphasizing the gravity of the moment.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: This indicates the act was more than just physical hygiene. It was a symbol of spiritual cleansing. To have a "part" with Jesus requires submitting to His service and allowing Him to cleanse us. We cannot save ourselves; we must accept His ministry to us.

Slide 10 Term Definition: “Clean every whit” (John 13:10)

Jesus distinguishes between a full bath (representing baptism/justification, which happens once) and the washing of feet (representing the daily cleansing from sins accumulated in our walk through the world).

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Peter’s reaction swings from prideful refusal ("Thou shalt never wash my feet") to impulsive excess ("not my feet only, but also my hands and my head"). This mirrors our own struggle with grace: we either feel too proud to accept help, or we try to add our own works to what Jesus has already done.

Slide 11 Question: Is this act intended only as a story, or as a continuing practice for the church?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the disciples looking at one another with realization and conviction as Jesus finishes the task.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.” (John 13:14-15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus gesturing to the basin and towel, instructing the group to follow His lead.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The language here is imperative. Jesus establishes an ordinance. Just as the bread and wine were given as memorials of His death, the washing of feet was given to prepare our hearts for that communion, fostering humility and removing alienation between brethren.

[DYK] In the early church, this practice continued. In 1 Timothy 5:10, the Apostle Paul lists "if she have washed the saints' feet" as a qualification for a widow to be supported by the church, placing it alongside good works like raising children and relieving the afflicted.

Slide 14 Question: What follows the act of humble service?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a disciple rising from washing another’s feet, a look of peace and brotherhood on his face.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.” (John 13:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the disciples embracing one another in reconciliation, soft golden light filling the room with warmth.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Knowledge alone does not bring blessing; action does. The word "happy" here implies "blessed." There is a specific spiritual joy released when we humble ourselves to serve others and seek reconciliation.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: This ordinance strikes at the root of selfishness. It is impossible to hold a grudge or feel superior to a brother or sister while kneeling to wash their feet. It prepares the heart for the Lord's Supper by ensuring we are in right standing not only with God but with one another.

Slide 18 Practical Application: How can we apply the spirit of this ordinance today?

• Participating in the Ordinance of Humility (Foot Washing) service at church
• Serving those who cannot repay us
• Seeking reconciliation with those we have argued with
• Remembering that any act of service to the "least of these" is service to Christ (Matt 25:40)
