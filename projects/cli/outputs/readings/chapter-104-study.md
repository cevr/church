Study Title: The Hope of the Resurrection: Victory Over the Grave

Question: What promise does God give regarding the power of death?

Biblical Answer: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.” (Hosea 13:14)

Explanation: God does not view death as a permanent state for His children. The language here is legal and military—He offers a "ransom" to buy us back and declares war on the grave itself, promising its ultimate destruction.

[DYK] The word "ransom" implies a price paid to liberate a captive. In the New Testament context, the life of Jesus was the price paid to liberate humanity from the dominion of death.

Question: Through whom is this victory over death accomplished?

Biblical Answer: “For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:21, 22)

Explanation: This establishes the parallel between Adam and Jesus (the "Second Adam"). Just as Adam’s choice brought mortality to the human race, Christ’s victory brings life. We inherit mortality from Adam, but we receive immortality through Christ.

Question: If there were no resurrection, what would be the condition of those who have died believing in Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “For if the dead rise not... Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” (1 Corinthians 15:16-18)

Explanation: This is a vital text for understanding the state of the dead. The apostle Paul argues that without the resurrection, the dead have "perished"—meaning they are gone forever. If the righteous went immediately to heaven at death, they would not be "perished" even if there were no resurrection. Thus, our hope relies entirely on Jesus waking us from the sleep of death.

[ILL] Consider a person sleeping in a dark room. They are unaware of the passing time until the morning light wakes them. Similarly, death is a sleep from which the believer awaits the call of the Lifegiver.

Question: How does nature illustrate the necessity of death before the new life?

Biblical Answer: “That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.” (1 Corinthians 15:36) ... “Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.” (John 12:24)

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This agricultural metaphor was profound for an agrarian society, but it holds deep spiritual truth. The seed (the natural body) must be "sown" (buried) to give way to the plant (the spiritual body). The decay of the seed is not a failure; it is part of the process of glorification.

Question: What will our new bodies be like at the resurrection?

Biblical Answer: “It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.” (1 Corinthians 15:42-44)

Term Definition: **"Incorruption"** refers to a state where the body is no longer subject to decay, sickness, aging, or death.

Deeper Insight: We are told in Philippians 3:20-21 that Jesus will change our "vile body" (humble, lowly body) to be fashioned like His "glorious body." We will not be disembodied spirits, but tangible, glorified beings, just as Jesus was real and tangible after His resurrection.

Question: When does this resurrection of the righteous occur?

Biblical Answer: “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16)

Explanation: The reward is given at the Second Coming of Jesus, not at the moment of death. This event is audible and visible.

Question: Are all the dead raised at the same time?

Biblical Answer: “And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished.” (Revelation 20:4, 5)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **The First Resurrection**: For the "just" (Acts 24:15), occurring at the Second Coming. This is the "resurrection of life."
2.  **The Millennium**: A thousand-year interval where the righteous are with Christ.
3.  **The Second Resurrection**: For the "unjust," occurring after the thousand years. This leads to the "second death."

[DYK] The concept of two resurrections separated by a millennium resolves many difficult scriptures. It explains how God deals fairly with the righteous (reward) and the wicked (judgment) in distinct phases.

Question: What is the final fate of death itself?

Biblical Answer: “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” (1 Corinthians 15:26)

Explanation: Death is not a friend; it is an "enemy." In God's recreated universe, this enemy will be no more. The ultimate shout of victory will be, "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?" (1 Corinthians 15:55).

Practical Application: Because of the resurrection, how should we live today?
• We grieve the loss of loved ones, but not as those without hope.
• We respect our bodies as seeds of a future glory.
• We look forward to the return of Jesus as the consummation of our salvation.
• We have assurance that justice will eventually be served for all.
