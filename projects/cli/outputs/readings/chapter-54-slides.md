Slide 1 Title: Unveiling the First Beast of Revelation 13

Slide 2 Question: How does the Bible describe the "beast" that rises out of the sea?

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: "And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion." (Revelation 13:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prophetic vision, a majestic but terrifying creature emerging from the sea, possessing the spotted coat of a leopard, the heavy paws of a bear, and the roaring head of a lion.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: This symbol is a composite. In Daniel 7, a lion represented Babylon, a bear represented Medo-Persia, and a leopard represented Greece. The beast in Revelation combines all these characteristics.

---

Slide 5 Interpretation: This combination suggests a power that absorbed the territories and traits of those previous empires. Historically, this points to the Roman power, and subsequently the Papacy—the church-state system of Rome.

[DYK] In Bible prophecy, a "beast" usually represents a kingdom, nation, or political power (see Daniel 7:17). When a beast has religious characteristics, it represents a union of church and state.

Slide 6 Question: Did the Bible predict that this power would arise from within the church or from outside it?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.” (2 Thessalonians 2:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul writing a letter by candlelight, his expression serious and warning.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: Paul warned of a "falling away"—an internal spiritual decline or apostasy—that would pave the way for the "man of sin." This power did not arise as an outside enemy but developed as the church began to compromise its purity.

---

Slide 9 Term Definition: "Falling Away" (Greek: *apostasia*) means a defection or revolt. In a religious context, it specifically means abandoning the original truths of Scripture.

---

Slide 10 Question: What was the first tangible sign of this "falling away" in history?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of early believers standing at a crossroads, one path leading to a simple church, the other to a pagan temple.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: The adoption of heathen (pagan) rites and customs into Christian worship.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: To make it easier for pagans to convert, early church leaders adopted pagan ceremonies and gave them Christian names. Historians note that they labeled these rituals "mysteries" to sound more like the heathen religions the people were accustomed to.

Slide 13 Illustration: Imagine taking a bottle labeled "Poison," dumping it out, filling it with water, but leaving the old label on it—or conversely, putting a "Water" label on a bottle of poison. The early church began mixing the "water" of the Gospel with the "poison" of pagan tradition.

Slide 14 Question: What political change solidified the power of this system?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Roman Emperor holding a scepter in one hand and a cross in the other.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: The union of Church and State, beginning largely under Emperor Constantine (312–337 A.D.).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Emperor Constantine seated on a throne, surrounded by bishops and soldiers.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Bishops became worldly and sought the power of the state to enforce their decrees. This was the "theocratical theory"—the idea that the church should use the government to administer God's will.

[SN] This union is dangerous because the tools of the State are force and the sword, while the tools of the Church are supposed to be love and the Word. When the Church picks up the sword, it ceases to represent Christ.

---

Slide 17 Question: How did this union affect the laws of God, specifically regarding time and worship?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient calendar carved into stone, with a hand pointing to a specific day.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: It led to the enforcement of Sunday observance and the setting aside of the biblical Sabbath.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a town crier in a Roman square reading a decree to a gathered crowd.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The Councils of Nicaea and Laodicea made decrees separating Christians from Jewish customs. Constantine urged the church to have "nothing in common with the Jews." The solemnity of the Sabbath was transferred to Sunday, the "venerable day of the sun."

[DYK] In 401 A.D., church leaders petitioned the emperor to ban public shows on Sunday, not because the Bible commanded it, but because the theaters were more popular than the churches! They used the law to force "devotion."

Slide 20 Question: What is the ultimate result when the church uses state power to force religion?

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “...who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God... showing himself that he is God.” (2 Thessalonians 2:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure sitting on a high, ornate throne, wearing elaborate vestments, looking down at the viewer.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: When the church uses force to compel the conscience, it takes the place of God. Augustine theorized that it is sometimes necessary to use the "rod of temporal suffering." This philosophy planted the seeds for the Inquisition.

---

Slide 23 Deeper Insight: True worship must be voluntary. The "Beast" represents a system of coerced worship. God, however, seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and in truth, drawn by love, not driven by fear.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus reaching out a hand in invitation, His expression gentle and non-threatening.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: We must guard our own hearts against "falling away."
• Do we rely on political power to solve spiritual problems?
• Do we value tradition over the plain Word of God?
• Are we following the "crowd" or the Bible?
