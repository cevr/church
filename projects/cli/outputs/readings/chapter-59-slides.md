---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?” (Matthew 16:3)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus pointed out a spiritual blindness. The people were skilled at predicting the weather by looking at the sky, yet they failed to recognize the specific prophecies being fulfilled right in front of them regarding the Messiah.

[DYK] The religious leaders had access to specific prophecies they overlooked:
• **The Sign:** A virgin bearing a son named Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14).
• **The Location:** Bethlehem Ephratah (Micah 5:2).
• **The Arrival:** Riding on a colt/donkey (Zechariah 9:9).

Slide 4 Question: What specific celestial signs did Jesus and the prophets predict would herald His Second Coming?

---

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars... The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.” (Luke 21:25; Joel 2:31)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: Just as there were literal physical signs for the First Advent, Scripture predicts literal disturbances in nature to signal the approach of the Second Advent.

[SN] **Historical Fulfillment:**
• **The Dark Day:** May 19, 1780—inexplicable darkness covered New England; candles were needed at noon.
• **The Falling Stars:** November 13, 1833—the most extensive meteor shower in recorded history.
*See Matthew 24:29.*

Slide 7 Question: Apart from nature, what social and intellectual conditions mark the "time of the end"?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel carefully rolling up a scroll and sealing it with wax by candlelight.

---

Slide 9 Explanation: The prophecy indicates a dual increase: a rapid expansion of travel ("running to and fro") and general knowledge, but specifically an unsealing of biblical understanding.

[ILL] Consider the 19th century: Just as the steam engine revolutionized travel, Bible Societies exploded onto the scene, printing millions of Bibles. Technology and Truth marched forward together to prepare the world.

Slide 10 Question: What will be the moral condition of humanity in the last days?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure looking sorrowful while surrounded by a crowd engaging in vanity and revelry.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: **"Form of godliness"**

This refers to maintaining the outer shell of religion—rituals, church attendance, and religious language—while lacking the transformative power of the Holy Spirit that actually changes the heart.

Slide 13 Deeper Insight: The text notes that while faithful servants give "meat in due season," "scoffers" will arise asking, "Where is the promise of His coming?" (2 Peter 3:3-4).

Skepticism regarding the literal return of Christ is, in itself, a fulfilled prophecy.

Slide 14 Question: In light of these signs, what is the urgent instruction for every believer?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a servant standing at an open door, holding a lamp high, looking out into the night expectantly.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” (Matthew 24:44)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an hourglass with sand running out, sitting on a table next to an open Bible.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Prophecy is not given merely to satisfy curiosity, but to stimulate preparation. Recognizing the signs should lead to a state of readiness—not fear, but faithful expectation.

[SN] The "Evil Servant" says in his heart, "My Lord delayeth his coming." A loss of urgency regarding the Second Advent leads directly to a decline in moral conduct.

---

Slide 17 Practical Application: How do we live in "readiness"?

1.  **Study:** Do not neglect the prophecies; be diligent not to miss the signs.
2.  **Share:** Give "meat in due season"—share the hope of the Gospel.
3.  **Watch:** Maintain spiritual vigilance over the world and your own heart.
