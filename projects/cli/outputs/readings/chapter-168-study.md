Study Title: The Divine Pattern for the Home: Duties of Parents and Children

Question: What is the fundamental command given to children regarding their parents?

Biblical Answer: “Honor thy father and thy mother.” (Exodus 20:12)

Explanation: This command is the fifth of the Ten Commandments and the first regarding human relationships. To "honor" means to value highly, to respect, and to treat with dignity. It is the foundation of order in the home and society.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "honor" is *kabed*, which literally means "to be heavy" or "weighty." In biblical culture, to honor someone meant to treat them as a person of great substance and significance, never lightly or casually.

Question: How are parents instructed to teach God’s ways to their children?

Biblical Answer: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.” (Deut. 6:6, 7)

Explanation: Religious education is not limited to the Sabbath; it is a continuous, daily lifestyle. Parents are to weave the knowledge of God into the ordinary activities of life—sitting, walking, resting, and rising.

[ILL] Just as a garden requires constant tending—watering, weeding, and sunlight—rather than a single massive flood of water once a year, a child's character is formed by the constant, gentle influence of godly instruction every day.

Question: What is the purpose and promise of training a child correctly?

Biblical Answer: “Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” (Prov. 22:6)

Explanation: The word "train" implies initiation or dedication. It suggests guiding a child into a habit or course of life. The promise is that the foundation laid in youth possesses a staying power that affects the entire life trajectory.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the life of Abraham. Genesis 18:19 records that God chose Abraham specifically because He knew Abraham would "command his children and his household after him" to keep the way of the Lord. The faithfulness of the patriarchs was rooted in faithful parenting.

Question: How does Scripture describe the necessity of correction and discipline?

Biblical Answer: “The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.” (Prov. 29:15); “He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.” (Prov. 13:24)

Explanation: The Bible presents a stark contrast between the world’s view and God’s view. While the world may view discipline as harsh, Scripture identifies the withholding of discipline as a lack of love ("hateth his son"). True love desires the eternal salvation of the child more than their temporary comfort.

Term Definition: "Betimes" (in Prov. 13:24) means "early" or "diligently." It implies correcting a habit before it becomes hardened.

Deeper Insight: Proverbs 23:14 mentions that correction "shalt deliver his soul from hell" (Sheol/the grave). This elevates parenting from mere behavior management to soul-winning. The parent acts as a watchman, guarding the child from paths that lead to spiritual death.

Question: What balance must fathers maintain while administering discipline?

Biblical Answer: “Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.” (Col. 3:21)

Explanation: Authority must never be exercised with tyranny or passion. If discipline is unjust, inconsistent, or done in anger, it breaks the child’s spirit ("discouraged"). The goal is restoration and obedience, not crushing the will.

[ILL] Think of a violin string. If it is too loose (lack of discipline), it produces no music. If it is wound too tight (provocation/severity), it snaps. The godly parent seeks the perfect tension to produce a beautiful character.

Question: How does the Bible link the state of the family to the "last days"?

Biblical Answer: “For men shall be lovers of their own selves... disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.” (2 Tim. 3:2)

Explanation: One of the signs of the peril of the last days is the breakdown of the home, specifically characterized by disobedience to parents. When the authority of the parent is rejected, the authority of God is soon rejected as well.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The prophet Malachi predicted that before the coming of the Lord, a message would go forth to "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers" (Mal. 4:6). The restoration of family religion is a key part of preparing a people for the Second Coming.

Question: Does the duty to honor parents end when we grow up?

Biblical Answer: “Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.” (Prov. 23:22); “Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man...” (Lev. 19:32)

Explanation: Respect for authority creates a culture of reverence. We are to honor our parents even in their old age, and this respect extends to all the aged ("hoary head"). This reverence is linked directly to the fear of God ("fear thy God; I am the Lord").

Practical Application:
• **For Parents:** Are we "training" (guiding habits) or just "managing" (stopping bad behaviors)? Are we teaching God's word diligently in the everyday moments?
• **For Children:** Do we treat our parents with "weight" and significance?
• **For All:** Do we show reverence to the aged, recognizing that in doing so, we honor the Ancient of Days?
