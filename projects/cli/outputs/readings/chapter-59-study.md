Study Title: Signs of the Times: Discernment and Hope

Question: Why did Jesus censure the religious leaders of His day?

Biblical Answer: “O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?” (Matthew 16:3)

Explanation: Jesus pointed out a spiritual blindness. The people could look at the sky and predict the weather, yet they failed to recognize the specific prophecies happening right in front of them regarding the Messiah.

[DYK] The religious leaders had access to specific prophecies they overlooked:
• **The Sign:** A virgin bearing a son named Immanuel (Isaiah 7:14, fulfilled Matt 1:22-23).
• **The Location:** Bethlehem Ephratah (Micah 5:2, fulfilled Matt 2:1).
• **The Arrival:** Riding on a colt/donkey (Zechariah 9:9, fulfilled Matt 21:4-5).

Question: What specific celestial signs did Jesus and the prophets predict would herald His Second Coming?

Biblical Answer: “And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars... The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come.” (Luke 21:25; Joel 2:31)

Explanation: Just as there were literal signs for the First Advent, Scripture predicts literal disturbances in nature to signal the approach of the Second Advent.

[SN] **Historical Fulfillment:** Students of prophecy note the literal fulfillment of these verses:
• **The Dark Day:** On May 19, 1780, an inexplicable darkness covered New England. Use of candles was required at noon, and the moon appeared as blood the following night.
• **The Falling Stars:** On November 13, 1833, the most extensive meteor shower in recorded history occurred, fulfilling the prediction of "stars falling from heaven."
*See Matthew 24:29.*

Question: Apart from nature, what social and intellectual conditions mark the "time of the end"?

Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

Explanation: The prophecy indicates a dual increase: a rapid expansion of travel and general knowledge, but specifically an unsealing of biblical understanding.

[ILL] Consider the 19th century: Just as the steam engine revolutionized travel ("running to and fro"), Bible Societies exploded onto the scene (British & Foreign Bible Society, American Bible Society), printing millions of Bibles. Technology and Truth marched forward together to prepare the world.

Question: What will be the moral condition of humanity in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers... lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.” (2 Timothy 3:1-5)

Term Definition: **"Form of godliness"** refers to maintaining the outer shell of religion—rituals, attendance, and language—while lacking the transformative power of the Holy Spirit that changes the heart.

Deeper Insight: The text notes that while some faithful servants are giving "meat in due season" (spiritual nourishment suited for the time), "scoffers" will arise asking, "Where is the promise of His coming?" (2 Peter 3:3-4). Skepticism regarding the literal return of Christ is itself a fulfilled prophecy.

Question: In light of these signs, what is the urgent instruction for every believer?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh.” (Matthew 24:44)

Explanation: Prophecy is not given merely to satisfy curiosity, but to stimulate preparation. Recognizing the signs should lead to a state of readiness—not fear, but faithful expectation.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The "Faithful and Wise Servant" (Matt 24:45) is contrasted with the "Evil Servant." The difference is not just their actions, but their internal belief. The evil servant says in his heart, "My Lord delayeth his coming." A loss of urgency regarding the Second Advent leads directly to a decline in moral conduct.

Practical Application: How do we live in "readiness"?
• **Study:** Do not neglect the prophecies; if the religious leaders missed the First Advent, we must be diligent not to miss the signs of the Second.
• **Share:** Like the faithful servant, give "meat in due season"—share the hope of the Gospel with others.
• **Watch:** Maintain a spiritual vigilance, observing the signs in the world and the condition of our own hearts.
