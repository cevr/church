Study Title: Testing the Spirits: Biblical Truth Regarding Spiritualism

Question: How does God regard the attempt to communicate with spirits, mediums, or the dead?

Biblical Answer: “Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the Lord your God.” (Leviticus 19:31)

Explanation: The Bible is explicit that God’s people are not to seek information or comfort from mediums or "familiar spirits." God calls this interaction "defiling." In the Old Testament, this practice was often linked with idolatry and rebellion against God’s direct guidance.

[DYK] In the ancient world, necromancy (consulting the dead) was a common religious practice among pagan nations surrounding Israel. God’s prohibition set His people apart, teaching them to rely solely on Him rather than the occult.

Question: If we encounter supernatural signs or spirits, by what standard must we test them?

Biblical Answer: “To the law and to the testimony; if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20)

Explanation: Not every supernatural event is from God. The ultimate test of any spirit, prophet, or message is whether it aligns with God’s Law and His written Word (the testimony). If a manifestation contradicts Scripture, it must be rejected, regardless of how impressive it appears.

[ILL] Imagine a counterfeiter who creates a bill that looks perfect to the naked eye. To detect the fraud, a banker doesn't rely on how "nice" the bill looks, but tests it against the master standard. We must test all spiritual experiences against the master standard of the Bible.

Question: Why does the Bible warn us against speaking to the dead? Do the dead know what is happening on earth?

Biblical Answer: “For the living know that they shall die; but the dead know not anything... Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion forever in anything that is done under the sun.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5, 6)

Progressive Disclosure: • The dead are unconscious • They have no memory of current events • Their emotions (love, hate) have ceased • They do not interact with the world ("under the sun").

Term Definition: “Sleep” is the term Jesus and the apostles frequently used to describe death (John 11:11-14). It implies a state of unconscious rest until the resurrection, not an active existence in a spirit world.

Deeper Insight: This doctrine is a safeguard. If the dead "know not anything," then any spirit claiming to be a deceased loved one is an imposter. Understanding the state of the dead protects the believer from emotional manipulation by deceptive spirits.

Question: If the dead are sleeping, who are the spirits that appear and perform miracles?

Biblical Answer: “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world...” (Revelation 16:14)

Explanation: The Bible reveals that fallen angels (demons) have the power to work miracles and disguise themselves. The apostle Paul warns that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14). These entities impersonate the dead to lead people away from the truth of God.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The rise of modern spiritualism in the mid-19th century coincided with a renewed interest in biblical prophecy. The "knocking" phenomena began in 1848, just shortly after the rediscovery of the Sanctuary doctrine. This suggests a counterfeit movement arose to distract from the recovery of biblical truth.

Question: What will be a specific danger in the "latter times"?

Biblical Answer: “Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.” (1 Timothy 4:1)

Explanation: Paul predicts a specific departure from the Christian faith driven by supernatural deceptions. We are warned that false Christs and false prophets will show "great signs and wonders" to deceive, if possible, even the elect (Matthew 24:24).

Practical Application: How do we stay safe from deception?
1.  **Study the Word:** Know the Bible so you can detect error (Isaiah 8:20).
2.  **Trust God's Care:** We do not need to consult mediums; we should "seek unto [our] God" (Isaiah 8:19).
3.  **Wait for the Resurrection:** Our hope is not in ghosts, but in the literal return of Jesus, when we will say, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us" (Isaiah 25:9).
