Study Title: God Speaks: The Gift of Prophecy in the Church

Question: How did God’s method of communicating with humanity change after the entrance of sin?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?” (Gen. 3:9). Since the fall: “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets.” (Heb. 1:1).

Explanation: In Eden, communication was direct and face-to-face. After the fall, sin separated humanity from God’s physical presence. However, God did not abandon His people; instead, He established a system of communication through chosen messengers known as prophets.

[DYK] The phrase "sundry times and divers manners" suggests that God uses various methods to reach us—sometimes through visions, sometimes dreams, and sometimes oral messages—adapting His communication so we can understand it.

Question: What is the source of a true prophet's message?

Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21).

Explanation: Prophecy is not the product of human genius, political insight, or vivid imagination. It is a "spiritual gift" initiated entirely by the Holy Spirit. The prophet is the vessel; the Spirit is the source.

[ILL] Think of a writer using a pen. The pen (the prophet) puts the ink on the paper, but the thoughts, words, and direction come entirely from the Writer (the Holy Spirit).

Question: How can we test whether a prophet is truly sent by God?

Biblical Answer:
1. **Fulfillment of predictions:** “When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken...” (Deut. 18:22).
2. **Fidelity to God:** “If there arise among you a prophet... and giveth thee a sign... saying Let us go after other gods... thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet.” (Deut. 13:1-3).

Explanation: A true prophet must meet strict criteria. First, their predictions must happen. Second, and most importantly, their teaching must lead people to obedience to the true God. Even if a miracle occurs, if the message contradicts God's law or leads to idolatry, the messenger is not from God.

Term Definition: "Presumptuously" refers to speaking with arrogance or taking authority that God has not granted. A false prophet speaks their own mind while claiming it is God's.

Question: What represents the purpose of spiritual gifts, such as prophecy, in the church?

Biblical Answer: “For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we all come in the unity of the faith...” (Eph. 4:12-13).

Progressive Disclosure: • Perfecting (maturing) the saints • Equipping for ministry • Edifying (building up) the church • Establishing unity

Deeper Insight: Paul lists apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers together. These gifts were given to bring the church to a "perfect man" (maturity). Since the church has not yet reached total perfection and unity, the gift of prophecy is still necessary and valid today.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the story of Agabus in Acts 21:10-11. He was a New Testament prophet who warned Paul of imprisonment. This shows that the gift of prophecy functioned in the early church to provide practical guidance and warnings, separate from the writing of the Canon of Scripture.

Question: How does the Bible describe the church of the last days regarding these gifts?

Biblical Answer: “And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Rev. 12:17). “The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” (Rev. 19:10).

Explanation: The "remnant"—the final group of believers at the end of time—is identified by two distinct marks: they keep God's Ten Commandments, and they possess the "testimony of Jesus," which the Bible defines as the Spirit of Prophecy. Just as the early church had this gift, the last-day church will see its revival.

[DYK] The prophecy of Joel 2:28 promises that in the "last days" God will pour out His Spirit, resulting in sons and daughters prophesying, old men dreaming dreams, and young men seeing visions.

Practical Application: How should we relate to the gift of prophecy today?
• **Desire it:** "Desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy" (1 Cor 14:1).
• **Respect it:** "Despise not prophesyings" (1 Thess 5:20).
• **Use it:** We should study the messages God has sent to guide, warn, and comfort His people in these final days.
