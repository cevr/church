---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.” (James 4:12)

“For I am the Lord, I change not.” (Malachi 3:6)

---

Slide 3 Basic Explanation: Since God is the only true Lawgiver and He does not change, His moral law is a reflection of His stable, eternal character. Human laws shift with culture and time, but the foundation of God’s government remains constant.

Slide 4 Did You Know?

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, kings often claimed to be lawgivers, but their laws could be arbitrary or revoked. The God of the Bible is unique because His law is an expression of His very nature—truth and justice—which never fluctuates.

Slide 5 Question: What is the character of God’s law compared to human nature?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man looking into a mirror, seeing a reflection that reveals the true condition of his heart.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.” (Romans 7:14)

“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul...” (Psalm 19:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scroll unrolled, emitting a pure white light that illuminates a shadowed room.

---

Slide 7 Basic Explanation: The law is "spiritual," dealing not just with outward actions but the condition of the heart. Humans in their natural state are "carnal" (fleshly).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person in deep contemplation, holding a hand over their heart, realizing their spiritual need.

---

Slide 8 Further Insight: The law reveals God's perfection to us, acting as an agent in the conversion process by showing us our need for a Savior and a change of heart.

**Term Definition: Carnal**
From the Latin *carnis* (flesh). In Scripture, it refers to the unrenewed human nature that is ruled by natural impulses and is often hostile to spiritual things.

Slide 9 Question: Did Jesus intend to abolish or change the law?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing on a mountaintop, teaching the multitude with authority and grace.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:17-18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus holding the Torah scroll with reverence, His face illuminated by a soft, holy glow.

---

Slide 11 Basic Explanation: Jesus explicitly stated He did not come to destroy the standard of righteousness. He came to demonstrate its depth and beauty.

[ILL] If a builder signs a contract to "fulfill" a blueprint, he does not tear the blueprint up. He follows it perfectly to build the house. Jesus "fulfilled" the law by living it out perfectly.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master builder examining a detailed blueprint while a magnificent structure rises in the background.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: Fulfill

**Fulfill**: In the context of obligation (like a law), this means "to perform" or "to keep." As Galatians 6:2 says, "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." It means to act in accordance with it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two figures helping each other carry a heavy load, representing the fulfillment of the law through love.

Slide 13 Question: What did Jesus say is necessary to enter into life?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a narrow, ancient gate opening onto a path that leads to a distant, radiant city.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” (Matthew 19:17)

“Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 7:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer walking faithfully on a path, looking upward toward the Father's will.

---

Slide 15 Explanation & Insight: While we are saved by grace, the result of that salvation is a life brought into harmony with God’s will. Profession ("Lord, Lord") is not enough; there must be a practical conformity to God’s character.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight**: Faith is not merely mental assent; it is a transaction where Christ’s life is exchanged for ours, empowering the believer to walk in obedience. The law tells us *what* to do; Christ gives us the power to *do* it.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ placing a hand on a kneeling believer’s shoulder, imparting strength and grace.

Slide 16 Question: How did religious leaders in Jesus’ day mistakenly treat God's law?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of Pharisees in elaborate robes arguing over a scroll, ignoring a humble person nearby.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? ... Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. ... But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:3, 6, 9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus gesturing sternly towards the religious leaders, rejecting their man-made rules.

---

Slide 18 Explanation & Context: Jesus warned that placing human tradition—customs, church rules, or cultural habits—above God’s explicit commands renders worship "vain" (empty).

[DYK] The specific tradition Jesus rebuked here was "Corban." A person could declare their money a "gift" to the temple to excuse themselves from financially supporting their aging parents. Jesus exposed this as a loophole to bypass God's law.

Slide 19 Question: By what standard will humanity be judged?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a great, solemn courtroom with a divine light illuminating a central book.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “...as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law... in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ...” (Romans 2:12, 16)

“...that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.” (Romans 3:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a multitude standing in awe and silence before the open scroll of the law.

---

Slide 21 Basic Explanation: The law acts as the standard of judgment. It silences human excuses by revealing the true standard of righteousness.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single figure bowing their head in recognition of truth, silence pervading the scene.

---

Slide 22 Question: What is the final reward for those who, through grace, obey God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the pearly gates of the New Jerusalem standing open.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Revelation 22:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Tree of Life, glowing with fruit and healing leaves, situated by a crystal river.

---

Slide 24 Deeper Insight: The Bible begins with a Law (in Eden) and a Tree of Life. It ends with the Commandments and access restored to the Tree of Life.

The entire plan of salvation is to restore man to harmony with God’s government so he can live in God’s presence forever.

Slide 25 Practical Application:
*   Do I view God's law as a restriction, or as a perfect guide for my soul?
*   Are there "traditions" in my life that conflict with Scripture?
*   Am I relying on just saying "Lord, Lord," or am I seeking to do the will of the Father?

*God’s law is the hedge of safety for His people, unchanged and unchangeable, guiding us to the feet of Jesus.*
