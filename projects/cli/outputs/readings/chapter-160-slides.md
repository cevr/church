---

Slide 1 Question: What specific warning did Jesus give regarding the influence of the religious leaders of His day?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” (Luke 12:1)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Jesus uses the metaphor of "leaven" (yeast). Just as a small amount of yeast permeates an entire batch of dough, causing it to rise through fermentation, hypocrisy affects the whole character. It puffs up the individual with pride while corrupting the inside.

Slide 4 Did You Know?

[DYK] In the Bible, leaven is almost always a symbol of sin or false doctrine. During the Passover, Israelites were commanded to sweep every crumb of leaven from their homes, symbolizing a complete removal of sin from their lives.

Slide 5 Question: How does the Bible define the actions of a hypocrite?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, This people draweth nigh unto Me with their mouth, and honoreth Me with their lips; but their heart is far from Me.” (Matthew 15:7, 8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man praying with his hands raised high, but his expression is cold and his eyes are wandering.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Hypocrisy is a disconnect between profession and reality. It is the act of saying the right things ("honoreth Me with their lips") while the internal motivation and affection ("their heart") are completely detached from God.

Slide 8 Term Definition: Hypocrite

**Greek Word:** *hypokrites*
**Literal Meaning:** "An actor" or "one who wears a mask."

In ancient Greek theater, actors wore large masks to portray different characters. A spiritual hypocrite is someone playing a role for an audience, rather than living a life for God.

Slide 9 Illustration: The Rotten Fruit

[ILL] Imagine a beautiful fruit that looks perfect on the outside—waxy, colorful, and firm—but when you bite into it, the core is rotten and hollow. Hypocrisy focuses entirely on polishing the skin of the fruit while neglecting the rot at the core.

---

Slide 10 Question: How did the Pharisees demonstrate this disconnect between their religion and God’s law?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Pharisees debating strictly over a scroll, ignoring a person in need nearby.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.” (Matthew 15:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elaborate religious scroll overshadowing a simple stone tablet of the Ten Commandments.

---

Slide 12 Progressive Disclosure: The "Corban" Evasion

1.  **The Command:** God said, "Honor thy father and mother."
2.  **The Evasion:** The Pharisees declared their money "Corban" (a gift to the temple).
3.  **The Result:** This exempted them from caring for aging parents, allowing them to claim holiness while violating God's Law.

---

Slide 13 Deeper Insight: True hypocrisy often involves elevating human tradition or man-made rules above the plain commandments of God. It is a form of legalism that looks religious but destroys the spirit of the Law, which is love.

Slide 14 Question: What creates a hypocrite, and is ignorance the same thing?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter and Barnabas conversing in low tones, looking conflicted.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him [Peter]; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.” (Galatians 2:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter stepping away from a table of Gentiles as Jewish leaders enter the room.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Paul rebuked Peter for "dissimulation" (pretending). Peter knew the truth—that the Gospel was for Gentiles—but acted differently to please others.

**Note:** Ignorance is *not* hypocrisy. Hypocrisy requires knowing the truth but acting against it to protect one's reputation.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul speaking firmly face-to-face with Peter, urging him to stand by the truth.

---

Slide 17 Speaker Note

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The danger of "dissimulation" is that it is contagious. Peter’s hypocrisy caused Barnabas—a good man full of the Holy Spirit—to be "carried away." Our lack of integrity can cause those looking up to us to stumble.

Slide 18 Question: What is the antidote to hypocrisy?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single beam of pure white light breaking through storm clouds.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” (James 3:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a serene olive grove, representing peace, gentleness, and good fruit.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: The cure for the leaven of the Pharisees is the "wisdom from above." This wisdom is characterized by purity and a lack of "partiality." It does not wear a mask. It is the same in private as it is in public.

Slide 21 Illustration: The Solid Gold Coin

[ILL] A solid gold coin rings true when dropped on a table; a hollow or plated coin sounds dull. A life without hypocrisy "rings true" because the inner character matches the outer profession.

Slide 22 Practical Application: Avoiding the Leaven

*   **Check the Heart:** Do I pray to be heard by God, or admired by people?
*   **Check the Eye:** Am I focused on the "mote" in my brother's eye while ignoring the "beam" in my own?
*   **Check the Law:** Do I follow traditions that conflict with God's Commandments?

---

Slide 23 Hope for the Sincere: While the "hypocrite's hope shall perish" (Job 8:13), God is near to those who call upon Him in truth (Psalm 145:18). He does not demand perfection immediately, but He demands honesty.
