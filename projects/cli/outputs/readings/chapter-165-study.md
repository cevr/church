Study Title: The Just Recompense: God's Law of Sowing and Reaping

Question: How should we treat others when we have the power to help them?

Biblical Answer: “Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.” (Prov. 3:27)

Explanation: Justice in the Bible is not merely refraining from doing harm; it is the active performance of good. If we have the ability ("power of thine hand") to bless someone and we hold back, we are violating the principle of God's kingdom.

[ILL] Consider a water pipe. Its purpose is not to store water but to convey it. If it blocks the flow, it becomes useless. Similarly, God blesses us so that we may be channels of blessing to others.

Question: What rule does Jesus give regarding how we judge and treat others?

Biblical Answer: “Judge not, that ye be not judged, for with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.” (Matt. 7:1, 2)

Explanation: This is the law of reciprocity. The standard of criticism or mercy we apply to others establishes the standard by which God and others will deal with us.

[DYK] The phrase "what measure ye mete" draws imagery from the ancient marketplace. Grain was measured in containers; if a merchant filled the container loosely (cheating the buyer), he could expect others to treat him the same way.

Question: When others treat us poorly, are we permitted to pay them back?

Biblical Answer: “Recompense to no man evil for evil.” (Rom. 12:17) ... “Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing.” (1 Peter 3:9)

Explanation: The natural human reaction is retaliation. The spiritual reaction is blessing. To return evil for evil is to be overcome by evil; to return good for evil is to overcome it (Rom 12:21).

Term Definition: **Recompense**: To repay, reward, or compensate. In Scripture, this applies to both the wages of sin and the rewards of righteousness.

Question: What fundamental law determines the reward we receive from God?

Biblical Answer: “Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.” (Gal. 6:7)

Explanation: Our future is determined by our present actions. This is not an arbitrary decision by God, but a natural result. Just as planting corn seeds produces corn, sowing acts of the "flesh" (selfishness) produces corruption, while sowing to the "Spirit" produces life everlasting (Gal 6:8).

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight**: This principle underscores the importance of *character building*. We are not saved by our works, but our works reveal our character. Ellen White and the SDA pioneers often emphasized that "character is the only treasure we can take from this world to the next." Every thought and act is a seed that contributes to the final harvest of character.

Question: Will God show partiality or favoritism in the final judgment?

Biblical Answer: “For there is no respect of persons with God.” (Rom. 2:11) ... “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Gen. 18:25)

Explanation: God’s judgment is perfectly just. He does not look at wealth, social status, or earthly rank. Every person, regardless of their station in life, will face the same standard.

Term Definition: **Respect of persons**: In the original Greek (*prosōpolēmpsia*), this literally means "receiving the face." It refers to a judge looking at a person's external appearance or status rather than the facts of the case. God never looks at the "mask," but always at the heart.

Question: Will there be a time when our character and destiny are fixed forever?

Biblical Answer: “He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still. And, behold, I come quickly.” (Rev. 22:11, 12)

Explanation: A solemn moment approaches when the door of opportunity closes. This text reveals that when Christ returns, character change is no longer possible. The "recompense" is given based on the character that has been formed during the time of probation.

[SN] **Prophetic Context**: Early Adventists referred to this as the "Close of Probation." Just as the door to the Ark was shut seven days before the flood rain began, there is a moment in history when the intercession of Christ ceases, and the cases of all humanity are decided. This highlights the urgency of "today" (Hebrews 3:15).

Question: Since all work will be tested, what is the urgent conclusion?

Biblical Answer: “For if... every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?” (Heb. 2:2, 3)

Explanation: The certainty of justice makes the offer of salvation precious. Since we have all "sown" seeds of sin, our only hope for a good "harvest" is the intervention of Jesus Christ, who took the "evil recompense" we deserved upon Himself.

Practical Application:
Since we are sowing seeds every day, what are we planting?
*   **In our words**: Are we sowing criticism or encouragement?
*   **In our actions**: Are we sowing selfishness or service?
*   **In our time**: Are we investing in the temporal or the eternal?
God has set before us "life and good, and death and evil" (Deut. 30:15). The choice is ours to make today.
