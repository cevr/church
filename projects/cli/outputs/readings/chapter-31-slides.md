---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred... unto a land that I will shew thee.” (Genesis 12:1)

“By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out... and he went out, not knowing whither he went.” (Hebrews 11:8, R.V.)

Slide 3 Explanation: Abraham (then Abram) was asked to leave his security, family, and culture for an unknown destination. The text clarifies that his obedience was not a blind leap into the dark, but a leap into the arms of God. The motive was faith; the action was obedience.

Slide 4 Did You Know?
In the ancient Near East, a person's identity and safety were entirely tied to their "father's house" and kinship group. To leave this was to make oneself vulnerable and entirely dependent on divine protection.

Slide 5 Question: How is the relationship between faith and actions (works) described in Scripture?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?” (James 2:22)

“For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing... but faith which worketh by love.” (Galatians 5:6)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: True faith is never static; it is an active principle. James explains that works are the evidence—or the "perfection"—of faith. Paul adds in Galatians that the driving force behind this active faith is love.

Slide 8 Illustration: Think of a fruit tree. Faith is the root and the sap, invisible beneath the surface. Obedience is the fruit. You cannot have the fruit without the root, but a root that produces no fruit is dead.

---

Slide 9 Term Definition: "Justified by works" (James 2:21)

In this context, it means "demonstrated to be righteous" or "vindicated." It does not mean earning heaven, but rather proving the genuineness of one's faith.

Slide 10 Question: Does God value religious rituals more than simple obedience?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.” (1 Samuel 15:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Prophet Samuel standing firm and pointing a finger of rebuke, while King Saul looks down in shame.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The prophet Samuel spoke these words to King Saul. God is not impressed by outward displays of religion (sacrifice) if the heart remains rebellious. A humble heart that listens and acts on God's word is of higher value than the most expensive offering.

Slide 13 Speaker Notes: Spirit-led Tangent

The "fat of rams" refers to the choicest part of the sacrifice. It represents giving God the very best "things." However, giving God things while withholding our will is a form of spiritual counterfeiting. The only thing we can give God that He does not already possess is our voluntary will.

---

Slide 14 Question: What example did Jesus Christ set regarding obedience?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking alone on a dusty path, His face set with gentle determination.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Though He were a Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered; And being made perfect, He became the Author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him.” (Hebrews 5:8-9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, kneeling in shadow with a ray of light illuminating His bowed head.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: Jesus is our pattern. He did not use His divinity to escape the requirements of the law. He lived a life of total dependence on the Father.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus working humbly as a carpenter, holding a piece of wood, soft light emphasizing His humanity and diligence.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The phrase "learned obedience" implies experiencing the reality and cost of obedience. Christ passed the test where Adam (and humanity) failed. His perfect obedience is credited to us for righteousness.

---

Slide 18 Question: How deep does this obedience go? Is it just about outward actions?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man sitting in deep contemplation, hand on his chin, staring into a reflection in a pool of water.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Casting down imaginations... and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” (2 Corinthians 10:5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fortified city gate, representing the mind, with a guard standing watch.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: The "obedience of faith" reaches into the mind. It involves surrendering our very thoughts, motives, and imaginations to the lordship of Jesus.

---

Slide 21 Question: What is the result for those who follow this path of obedient faith?

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love...” (1 Peter 1:22)

“If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.” (Isaiah 1:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a family gathered around a table filled with bread and fruit, bathed in warm, inviting light.

---

Slide 23 Practical Application: True obedience purifies the soul and results in love for others. It is not a burden, but a pathway to blessing.

• Where is God asking for "obedience of faith" in your life today?
• Are there "sacrifices" (religious activities) you are offering instead of simply obeying a clear command?
