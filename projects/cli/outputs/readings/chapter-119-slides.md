Slide 3 Explanation: The Christian experience is not a static event; it is a living process. Just as physical life must grow to remain healthy, spiritual life requires constant expansion in our understanding of Jesus.

[DYK] The word "grace" (*charis*) refers to God’s unmerited favor, but also to the divine influence upon the heart that empowers us to live a holy life.

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.” (2 Peter 1:4)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: We do not escape the world through our own willpower, but by laying hold of God’s promises. By believing what He says and claiming it, the power of God actually enters our lives.

Slide 7 Illustration: The Check

[ILL] Imagine a signed check from a billionaire. The paper itself is just paper, but the promise written on it represents real wealth. God’s promises are like that check—when we claim them by faith, we receive the spiritual resources we need.

2.  **Virtue**: Moral excellence and courage.

Slide 12 Insight: The Order of Growth

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This list is sequential. Faith is the root; Virtue is the first shoot. One cannot have true patience without self-control. "Sanctification" is not a moment of feeling, but "the work of a lifetime"—climbing this ladder round by round.

---

Slide 13 Question: How does the Bible define "Charity," the crowning grace of this ladder?

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Charity suffereth long, and is kind... seeketh not her own... Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7); “...put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.” (Colossians 3:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people holding hands in a circle, bound together by a glowing cord of light.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Charity is *agape*—the God-kind of love. It is the "bond" or glue that holds all other virtues together. Without love, the other virtues are hollow.

Slide 16 Question: What is the result of possessing these qualities versus lacking them?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a path that splits; one way leads to a fruitful orchard, the other to a barren desert.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: Possessing the Graces

“They make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2 Peter 1:8)

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: Lacking the Graces

“But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.” (2 Peter 1:9)

[Explanation] Spiritual stagnation leads to blindness. Without growth, we lose sight of the cross and forget the cost of our salvation.

Slide 19 Question: What assurance is given to the Christian who diligently pursues this growth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise over a calm sea, symbolizing hope and certainty.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.” (2 Peter 1:10)

[Insight] This suggests our security in Christ is maintained through a living, growing connection. We are safe as long as we are climbing.

Slide 21 Practical Application

*   **Self-Examination**: Which step of the ladder are you currently struggling with?
*   **Daily Diligence**: Are you adding "virtue" to your faith today by making moral choices?
*   **Promise Claiming**: When you feel weak, which "precious promise" can you claim?
