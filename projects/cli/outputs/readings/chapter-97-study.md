Study Title: The Author of Liberty

Question: How does God respond to human suffering and oppression?

Biblical Answer: “And the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried... And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant... I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.” (Exodus 2:23-24; 3:9)

Explanation: God is not indifferent to the plight of the enslaved or the suffering. The Bible reveals a God who hears, sees, and remembers His promises. His response to the physical slavery of Israel becomes the pattern for His response to spiritual slavery.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "groaning" implies a deep, guttural cry of distress. It signifies that even when we cannot form words for our pain, God understands the language of our sighs.

Question: What is the foundation of God's Law?

Biblical Answer: “I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” (Exodus 20:2)

Explanation: Before God gave the Ten Commandments, He identified Himself as the Liberator. Obedience to God’s law is not a means to earn freedom, but a response of gratitude for freedom already granted. True law protects liberty.

[ILL] Consider a train. It is only "free" to move at high speeds and carry heavy loads when it stays on the tracks. If it jumps the tracks to be "free" of them, it becomes stuck in the mud. God's law is the track that allows human liberty to function safely.

Question: How does God expect those He has freed to treat others?

Biblical Answer: “And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go away empty... thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to day.” (Deuteronomy 15:13-15)

Progressive Disclosure:
• Empathy born of experience (“remember you were a bondman”)
• Generosity (“furnish him liberally”)
• Protection of the vulnerable (“thou shalt neither vex a stranger”)

Term Definition: “Jubilee” (Leviticus 25:10) was a specific fifty-year cycle in Israel’s economy where liberty was proclaimed throughout the land, debts were cancelled, and ancestral lands were returned. It prevented permanent poverty and generational slavery.

[SN] The Jubilee is a type (a prophetic symbol) of the final restoration of the earth. Just as the trumpet sounded liberty on the Day of Atonement, the "last trump" will signal the ultimate return of God’s people to their lost possession—Eden.

Question: What is the relationship between the Sabbath and liberty?

Biblical Answer: “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt... therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.” (Deuteronomy 5:15)

Explanation: While Exodus 20 links the Sabbath to Creation, Deuteronomy links it to Redemption. The Sabbath is a weekly declaration of freedom—a time when neither master nor servant labors. It is a memorial that we are not merely units of production, but free children of God.

Question: What constitutes acceptable worship in God's eyes?

Biblical Answer: “Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?” (Isaiah 58:6)

Deeper Insight: Religious forms—fasting, praying, attending gatherings—are rejected by God if they coexist with oppression and selfishness. True revival (reformation) always leads to practical benevolence and the restoration of rights to the downtrodden.

Question: What is the deepest form of slavery that Christ came to abolish?

Biblical Answer: “Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.” (John 8:34)

Explanation: Political liberty is vital, but Christ addresses the root cause of all bondage. A man may be free from chains yet be a slave to anger, addiction, or selfishness.

Question: How does Jesus define His mission regarding this slavery?

Biblical Answer: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me... to preach deliverance to the captives... to set at liberty them that are bruised.” (Luke 4:18)

[SN] The link between the Spirit and Liberty is vital. Paul writes, "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty" (2 Corinthians 3:17). This is not liberty *to* sin, which brings bondage, but liberty *from* sin, which brings peace. This aligns with the early Adventist emphasis that the Spirit writes the Law on the heart, making obedience a delight rather than a burden.

Question: What is the "Golden Rule" of liberty?

Biblical Answer: “Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.” (Matthew 7:12)

Practical Application: True liberty is unselfish.
• In the Home: Serving one another rather than demanding rights.
• In the Church: Leaders are to be servants, not "lords" (Mark 10:42-45).
• In Society: Defending the conscience and rights of others as vigorously as our own.

Final Thought: “If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.” (John 8:36)
