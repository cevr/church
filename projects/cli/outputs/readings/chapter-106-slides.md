Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” (Romans 6:23)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible presents a stark contrast between wages and a gift.
*   **Wages:** The payment earned for work. Sin earns death.
*   **Gift:** Something not naturally possessed. Eternal life is given only through Jesus.

Slide 4 Definition & Illustration:
*   **"Die" and "Perish":** To cease to live; to expire; to be blotted from existence.
*   **[ILL]** Just as a paycheck is the end result of an employee's labor, death is the specific, final result of sin. It is the removal of the gift of life, not an eternal existence in misery.

Slide 5 Question: How complete is this destruction? Will the wicked continue to exist in some form?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven... and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.” (Malachi 4:1)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The destruction is total.
*   The imagery of "stubble" in an oven suggests a fire that consumes completely.
*   Obadiah 1:16 adds that they shall be “as though they had not been.”

Slide 8 Did You Know?

[DYK] The Psalmist compares the end of the wicked to the "fat of lambs" consuming into smoke (Psalm 37:20). In the ancient sacrificial system, the fat was completely burned away on the altar, leaving nothing behind but smoke and ash.

Slide 9 Question: Where will this punishment take place, and does it happen immediately at death?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.” (2 Peter 2:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of angels standing guard, separating light from darkness, symbolizing the reservation for judgment.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The wicked are not currently being punished. They are "reserved"—kept in waiting—until the final Day of Judgment. Revelation 20:9 indicates this fire comes down from God "on the breadth of the earth."

Slide 12 Deeper Insight: The Earth as the Place of Judgment.
Scripture says, “the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner” (Proverbs 11:31). God does not have a separate, eternal torture chamber; He purifies the very earth where sin was committed.

Slide 13 Speaker Note: Root and Branch Imagery.

[SN] The "Root and Branch" imagery in Malachi is often viewed by Adventist pioneers as representing Satan (the root) and his followers (the branches). This signifies the end of the entire mystery of iniquity. Sin is not perpetuated in an eternal hell; it is eradicated so the universe can be clean again.

Slide 14 Question: What happens to the earth after this purifying fire?

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pristine, lush landscape, rivers flowing, and soft golden light bathing a renewed world.

---

Slide 16 Explanation & Illustration:
*   The fire melts the elements and purifies the earth.
*   From these ashes, God creates a New Earth for the meek to inherit.
*   **[ILL]** Like a forest fire clearing away deadwood to allow for lush new growth, God’s fire is a cleansing force, preparing the world for a fresh start.

Slide 17 Question: What will be the condition of the universe when sin is gone?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the night sky filled with bright, peaceful stars, conveying a sense of universal harmony.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth... heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.” (Revelation 5:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast multitude of diverse people and angels looking toward a glorious throne in the distance.

Slide 19 Summary: The Result of God's Justice.
*   Sin is gone.
*   The wicked are no more.
*   The earth is renewed.
*   Universal praise is restored.

Slide 20 Practical Application:
This doctrine reveals God is both just and merciful. He does not torture enemies eternally; He removes sin to secure the universe's happiness.

**The Choice:** Life or Death? God invites us to choose Life.
