---

Slide 1 Question: By what standard will all humanity ultimately be judged?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep His commandments; for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment... whether it be good or whether it be evil.” (Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14)

Slide 3 Biblical Answer (Continued): “So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” (James 2:12)

---

Slide 4 Explanation: The Bible establishes a law that acts as the standard for judgment. It encompasses the "whole duty of man" and is described by James as a "law of liberty," defining our moral obligation to God.

[DYK] In the Hebrew text of Ecclesiastes, "whole duty of man" literally reads "this is the whole man." The implication is that our very purpose and wholeness are found in alignment with God's will.

Slide 5 Question: Is there a different law that was temporary and is no longer binding?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross... Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day... or of the sabbath days.” (Colossians 2:14–16)

Slide 7 Biblical Answer (Continued): “Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” (Colossians 2:17)

---

Slide 8 Definition: **"Handwriting of Ordinances"** refers to the ceremonial laws (sacrifices, food offerings, festivals) written by Moses.
**"Shadow"** implies a silhouette. These services were a silhouette of the work Jesus would do. Once the reality (Christ) arrived, the shadow was no longer needed.

Slide 9 Question: How does the Bible distinguish between the content and purpose of these two laws?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two distinct items on a table: two stone tablets and a rolled parchment scroll, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: **The Moral Law (Nature):**
“The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.” (Psalm 19:7).
It defines sin: “Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law; for sin is the transgression of the law.” (1 John 3:4).

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: **The Ceremonial Law (Nature):**
“The law of commandments, contained in ordinances.” (Ephesians 2:15).
It deals with offerings: “...If any man of you bring an offering...” (Leviticus 1:2).

---

Slide 12 Comparison:
**Moral Law:** Existed *before* the fall; defines our relationship to God and man; converts the soul.
**Ceremonial Law:** Introduced *after* sin entered as a remedial system; involved sacrifices that pointed to the Perfect One.

---

Slide 13 Illustration: The Mirror and the Basin.
The Moral Law is like a **Mirror**: It reveals the dirt (sin) on our face but cannot wash it off.
The Ceremonial Law was like a **Basin** (sacrifices): It offered a method of cleansing that represented the future cleansing blood of Christ.

---

Slide 14 Question: How were these two laws delivered differently, highlighting their difference in duration?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Mount Sinai shrouded in smoke and fire, contrasting with a tent where a scribe is writing, soft light.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: **Moral Law:**
“The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire... even ten commandments.” (Deuteronomy 4:12, 13).
“He wrote them in two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy 5:22).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the stone tablets glowing faintly with engraved letters, resting on a rock, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: **Ceremonial Law:**
“And the Lord called unto Moses... saying, Speak unto the children of Israel...” (Leviticus 1:1, 2).
“...laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant.” (Nehemiah 9:14).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses sitting in a tent, writing carefully on a scroll with a reed pen, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: The Moral Law was spoken by God and written on **stone** (unchangeable, eternal). The Ceremonial Law was given to Moses to write in a **book** (temporary, instructional until the "time of reformation").

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: In the ancient Near East, royal decrees meant to last forever were inscribed on rock (stelae), while administrative records were written on parchment or clay. God writing on stone signifies the immutable nature of His character.

Slide 18 Question: How did Jesus treat these two laws?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching on the mount, with a gentle expression, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: **Moral Law:**
“The Lord is pleased for His righteousness' sake; He will magnify the Law, and make it honorable.” (Isaiah 42:21).
Jesus said, “Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law...” (Matthew 5:18).

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: **Ceremonial Law:**
“Having abolished in His flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances.” (Ephesians 2:15).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the temple veil being torn in two from top to bottom, revealing the Holy of Holies, soft light.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: Jesus did not destroy the Moral Law; He "magnified" it to include thoughts and motives. However, His death fulfilled the system of types and shadows, ending the ceremonial system.

---

Slide 22 Question: Does the Sabbath belong to the temporary ceremonial law or the eternal moral law?

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it.” (Genesis 2:2, 3).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Creation week, focusing on the seventh day of rest, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: The Sabbath was established at Creation, *before* sin entered the world. The ceremonial law was introduced *after* sin as a remedy. Therefore, the Creation Sabbath is part of the eternal Moral Law, not a shadow.

[DYK] The "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 refer to yearly ceremonial sabbaths (feasts) tied to specific dates, which fell on different days of the week. These are distinct from the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath written on stone.

---

Slide 25 Practical Application:
1. **Guidance:** Look to the Moral Law to understand God’s will.
2. **Faith:** Trust solely in Jesus, not rituals, for salvation.
3. **Rest:** Keep the Sabbath as a memorial of Creation, not a shadow of salvation.
