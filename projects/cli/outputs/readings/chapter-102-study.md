Study Title: Origin, History, and Destiny of Satan

Question: Did sin originate with humanity, or did it exist before?

Biblical Answer: “God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment.” (2 Peter 2:4)

Explanation: Scripture reveals that sin did not begin on earth, but among the angelic host. There was a rebellion involving a specific group of angels led by a specific being.

[DYK] The word "Satan" is Hebrew for "Adversary" or "Opponent." The word "Devil" (Diabolos) is Greek for "Slanderer." These titles describe his character and actions, not just his name.

Question: Who is the leader of this rebellion, and what was his original state?

Biblical Answer: “Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so... Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.” (Ezekiel 28:14, 15)

Explanation: Satan was not created as a devil. He was created as a "cherub"—a high-ranking angel. He was "perfect" and "anointed." God did not create evil; He created a free moral agent who chose to rebel.

Term Definition: "Covering Cherub" refers to the highest position an angel could hold. In the earthly sanctuary (a pattern of the heavenly), two cherubim stood upon the Ark of the Covenant, their wings "covering" the mercy seat where God’s presence dwelt (Exodus 25:20-22). Satan once stood in the immediate presence of God’s law and glory.

[ILL] Imagine a trusted prime minister standing right beside the king's throne, entrusted with the secrets of the kingdom. This was Lucifer’s position before he became a traitor.

Question: What happened to cause his fall, and where is he now?

Biblical Answer: “I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.” (Luke 10:18) “He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth.” (John 8:44)

Explanation: Because of pride and violence (Ezekiel 28:16), he was cast out of the "mountain of God." He could no longer abide in the truth. Since then, he has brought his rebellion to this world, deceiving humanity and persecuting those who follow God.

[SN] Spirit-led insight: The phrase "abode not in the truth" implies that truth is a dwelling place. When Satan left the truth, he left his home. Now, his only weapon is the "lie" (Gen 3:4), which he uses to distort God's character to the world.

Question: Who is Satan's specific target in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “And the dragon [Satan] was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.” (Revelation 12:17)

Explanation: Satan is angry with the "woman" (a symbol for the church). His wrath is focused on the "remnant"—the last generation of believers who maintain two distinct characteristics: they keep God's commandments and hold the testimony of Jesus.

[DYK] Throughout history, the "dragon" has used various earthly powers to persecute God's people, from pagan Rome to the religious powers of the Middle Ages. In the end times, the focus is on those who refuse to compromise God's law.

Question: How will Satan deceive the world just before the end?

Biblical Answer: “And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do...” (Revelation 13:14) “For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles...” (Revelation 16:14)

Explanation: In the final conflict, Satan will not just use force; he will use supernatural deception. Miracles, signs, and wonders will be performed to validate false worship. This is why our faith must be rooted in the Bible rather than in sensory experience or supernatural displays.

Question: What is the ultimate destiny of Satan? Will he reign in hell forever?

Biblical Answer: “I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee... thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be anymore.” (Ezekiel 28:18, 19) “And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.” (Revelation 20:9)

Explanation: Satan is not the king of hell, nor will he torture souls for eternity. The Bible teaches that he will be "devoured" and turned to "ashes." His destiny is total destruction and non-existence. He will "never be anymore." Sin and sinners are consumed, cleansing the universe.

[SN] Theological Note: This truth vindicates God’s character. A God of love does not perpetuate evil through eternal torture. Instead, He eventually removes the cancer of sin entirely, leaving a clean universe where "affliction shall not rise up the second time" (Nahum 1:9).

Practical Application: Since we have an adversary seeking to devour like a roaring lion (1 Peter 5:8), what is our defense?
• Be sober and vigilant (stay alert)
• Resist him steadfast in the faith
• Keep the commandments of God
• Rely on the victory Jesus already won in the wilderness and at the cross.
