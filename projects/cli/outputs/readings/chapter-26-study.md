Study Title: Consecration: Set Apart for Holy Use

Question: What was the ancient symbol for setting someone apart for God’s service?

Biblical Answer: "And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest's office." (Exodus 30:30)

Explanation: In the Old Testament, priests were consecrated (made holy) through anointing with oil. This act signified that they no longer belonged to themselves or common labor; they were reserved exclusively for God's purposes.

[DYK] The English word "consecrate" comes from Latin roots meaning "associated with the sacred." In the Bible, it implies a deliberate "filling of the hand"—a Hebrew idiom meaning to empower or equip someone for a specific task.

Question: How does the Bible describe believers today?

Biblical Answer: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people... which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God." (1 Peter 2:9, 10)

Explanation: The privileges once held only by Aaron’s distinct family are now extended to all who accept Christ. To be a "peculiar people" in the King James usage does not mean to be strange or odd; it means to be God's own "special possession" or "purchased property."

Term Definition: **Darkness vs. Light.** The text notes we are called "out of darkness into His marvelous light." This represents a change in ownership—from the confusion of the world to the clarity of God's truth.

Question: What is the cost of becoming a true disciple of Jesus?

Biblical Answer: "So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple." (Luke 14:33)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Surrender:** We must be willing to give up ownership of our possessions.
2.  **Priority:** We must value Christ above family and even our own lives (Luke 14:26).
3.  **Exchange:** We trade our heavy burdens for His yoke (Matthew 11:29).

[ILL] A yoke is a wooden beam used to couple two oxen together to pull a load. When Jesus says, "Take My yoke upon you," He is inviting us to walk side-by-side with Him. He bears the weight; we simply walk in step with Him.

[SN] The language of "hating" father and mother in Luke 14:26 is a Semitic idiom. It does not mean emotional malice, but rather a hierarchy of loyalty. If forced to choose between the will of family and the will of God, the consecrated person chooses God, making the earthly relationship seem secondary by comparison.

Question: How close is the union between the consecrated person and Christ?

Biblical Answer: "I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without Me ye can do nothing." (John 15:5)

Explanation: Consecration is not just a legal transaction; it is a vital, living connection. Just as a branch cannot survive or produce grapes if cut off from the vine, a believer cannot produce a holy character ("fruit") without a constant spiritual connection to Jesus.

Deeper Insight: The "fruit" mentioned here is defined in Galatians 5:22-23 as "love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." These are not human achievements, but the natural result of the Holy Spirit flowing through a consecrated life.

Question: If we are consecrated to God, how should we view our physical bodies?

Biblical Answer: "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you... and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's." (1 Corinthians 6:19, 20)

Explanation: Because Christ paid the price for our redemption at the Cross, He holds the title deed to our lives. Our bodies become dwelling places for His Spirit. This changes how we treat our health, our minds, and our actions—we are maintaining God's property, not our own.

[SN] The "Temple" imagery is profound in Adventist pioneer thought. Just as the earthly wilderness sanctuary was kept holy for God's presence, the human body is to be preserved in health and purity so that the mind can clearly discern the will of God.

Question: What is the final response of a fully consecrated heart?

Biblical Answer: "Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me." (Isaiah 6:8)

Explanation: Consecration always leads to service. When the will is surrendered and the heart is cleansed, the natural response to God's call is immediate willingness to be used, however He sees fit.

Practical Application: Consecration is a daily act.
*   **Morning:** Dedicate your day to God before you get out of bed.
*   **Decisions:** Ask, "Does this action glorify the Owner of this temple?"
*   **Relationships:** Love others through the strength of the "Vine."
