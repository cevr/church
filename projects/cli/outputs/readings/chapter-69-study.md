Study Title: The Nature and Perpetuity of God’s Law

Question: How many Lawgivers are there, and does His character change?

Biblical Answer: “There is one Lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.” (James 4:12) “For I am the Lord, I change not.” (Malachi 3:6)

Explanation: Since God is the only true Lawgiver and He does not change, His moral law is a reflection of His stable, eternal character. Human laws shift with culture and time, but the foundation of God’s government remains constant.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, kings often claimed to be lawgivers, but their laws could be arbitrary or revoked. The God of the Bible is unique because His law is an expression of His very nature—truth and justice—which never fluctuates.

Question: What is the character of God’s law compared to human nature?

Biblical Answer: “For we know that the law is spiritual; but I am carnal, sold under sin.” (Romans 7:14) “The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul...” (Psalm 19:7)

Explanation: The law is "spiritual," dealing not just with outward actions but the condition of the heart. Humans in their natural state are "carnal" (fleshly). The law reveals God's perfection to us, acting as an agent in the conversion process by showing us our need for a Savior and a change of heart.

Term Definition: **Carnal**: From the Latin *carnis* (flesh). In Scripture, it refers to the unrenewed human nature that is ruled by natural impulses and is often hostile to spiritual things.

Question: Did Jesus intend to abolish or change the law?

Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:17-18)

Explanation: Jesus explicitly stated He did not come to destroy the standard of righteousness.

[ILL] If a builder signs a contract to "fulfill" a blueprint, he does not tear the blueprint up. He follows it perfectly to build the house. Jesus "fulfilled" the law by living it out perfectly, demonstrating its depth and beauty.

Term Definition: **Fulfill**: In the context of obligation (like a law), this means "to perform" or "to keep." As Galatians 6:2 says, "Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ." It means to act in accordance with it.

Question: What did Jesus say is necessary to enter into life?

Biblical Answer: “If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.” (Matthew 19:17) “Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven.” (Matthew 7:21)

Explanation: While we are saved by grace, the result of that salvation is a life brought into harmony with God’s will. Profession ("Lord, Lord") is not enough; there must be a practical conformity to God’s character as revealed in His law.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight**: This touches on the historic Adventist understanding of "Righteousness by Faith." Faith is not merely mental assent; it is a transaction where Christ’s life is exchanged for ours, empowering the believer to walk in obedience. The law tells us *what* to do; Christ gives us the power to *do* it.

Question: How did religious leaders in Jesus’ day mistakenly treat God's law?

Biblical Answer: “Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? ... Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. ... But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:3, 6, 9)

Explanation: Jesus warned that placing human tradition—customs, church rules, or cultural habits—above God’s explicit commands renders worship "vain" (empty).

[DYK] The specific tradition Jesus rebuked here was "Corban." A person could declare their money a "gift" to the temple, thereby excusing themselves from the commandment to financially support their aging parents (Honor thy father and mother). Jesus exposed this as a loophole to bypass God's law.

Question: By what standard will humanity be judged?

Biblical Answer: “...as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law... in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ...” (Romans 2:12, 16) “...that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.” (Romans 3:19)

Explanation: The law acts as the standard of judgment. It silences human excuses by revealing the true standard of righteousness.

Question: What is the final reward for those who, through grace, obey God?

Biblical Answer: “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Revelation 22:14)

Deeper Insight: The Bible begins with a Law (in Eden) and a Tree of Life. It ends with the Commandments and access restored to the Tree of Life. The entire plan of salvation is to restore man to harmony with God’s government so he can live in God’s presence forever.

Practical Application:
*   Do I view God's law as a restriction, or as a perfect guide for my soul?
*   Are there "traditions" in my life that conflict with Scripture?
*   Am I relying on just saying "Lord, Lord," or am I seeking to do the will of the Father?

*God’s law is the hedge of safety for His people, unchanged and unchangeable, guiding us to the feet of Jesus.*
