Study Title: Reconciled to God: From Enmity to Peace

---

Slide 1 Question: What is the natural state of the human mind, and how does it relate to God?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.” (Romans 8:7)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The term "carnal" refers to the fleshly, natural human nature apart from the Holy Spirit. Our natural inclination is not merely indifferent to God, but actively hostile ("enmity") toward Him.

Term Definition: **Enmity** means deep-seated, mutual hatred or hostility. It is the state of being an enemy.

---

Slide 4 Illustration: Imagine a stream flowing downhill. It is the nature of the water to go down. It cannot suddenly decide to flow uphill; it requires an external force to change its direction.

[ILL] Similarly, the carnal mind flows naturally toward self and sin; it cannot submit to God without the power of the Holy Spirit.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rushing river flowing forcefully down a rocky landscape, highlighting the natural pull of gravity.

---

Slide 5 Question: What is the ultimate result of remaining in this carnal state?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For to be carnally minded is death.” (Romans 8:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a broken clay vessel lying in the dust, symbolizing the fragility and end of the carnal state.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Because the carnal mind rejects the Source of Life (God) and violates the principles of life (God’s Law), the inevitable result is death.

[DYK] In the biblical worldview, death is not just the cessation of breath; it is total separation from God. This was the warning given in Eden, and it remains the consequence of the carnal nature today.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve looking back at the gates of Eden from a distance, symbolizing separation and loss.

---

Slide 8 Question: Since we cannot fix ourselves, what offers does God make to us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd extending a hand down a rocky ledge to help a lost sheep, soft light illuminating the gesture.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “We pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.” (2 Corinthians 5:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a messenger holding a scroll of peace, standing with open arms before a crowd.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Despite our natural hostility, God takes the initiative. He sends ambassadors to plead for peace. To be "reconciled" means to be restored to friendship and harmony after a period of estrangement.

[SN] In the Great Controversy between good and evil, God has been misrepresented as a tyrant. Here, Paul paints God not as a judge eagerly waiting to punish, but as a loving Father pleading through His servants for His children to come home.

Slide 11 Question: What acts on our part are necessary to accept this reconciliation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure kneeling in a simple room, head bowed in prayer, soft light resting on them.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.” (Acts 3:19) | “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins...” (1 John 1:9)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person washing their hands in a basin of water, symbolizing cleansing and purification.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: Reconciliation requires a response:
1.  **Repentance:** A genuine sorrow for sin and turning away.
2.  **Confession:** Acknowledging specific faults.
3.  **Conversion:** A complete change of direction.

---

Slide 14 Deeper Insight: The text mentions sins being "blotted out." This implies a record was kept. In the sanctuary service, the record of sin is removed, signifying a complete cleansing of the conscience.

---

Slide 15 Question: How thorough is this change within the believer?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter reshaping a clay vessel on a wheel, the clay taking on a new and perfect form.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunrise breaking over a landscape, the morning light banishing the mists of the night.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: Salvation is not a renovation; it is a re-creation. The "old man" (the carnal mind) is crucified, and a new nature is implanted by Christ.

[ILL] A caterpillar does not merely sprout wings to become a butterfly; it undergoes a metamorphosis where it is structurally changed into a completely new creature. So it is with the believer "in Christ."

Slide 18 Question: How can we tell if a person has truly been reconciled and changed?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a lush vineyard, the vines heavy with ripe, healthy grapes.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.” (Matthew 7:20) | “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Galatians 5:22, 23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a basket filled with various ripe fruits (figs, pomegranates, grapes) sitting on a wooden table.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: The evidence of the "new creature" is not just what they say, but how they live. If the Spirit is the root, a Christ-like character is the fruit.

[SN] Note that "fruit" is singular in the Greek text. We do not pick and choose which virtues to have; the Holy Spirit produces a single, unified character that reflects the life of Jesus.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a strong, healthy tree with deep roots visible in the soil, bearing abundant fruit in the branches.

Slide 21 Question: What is the final standing of the one who is reconciled to God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing atop a hill at sunset, looking up with a peaceful expression, wind blowing through their robe.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:1) | “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus...” (Romans 8:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a courtroom scene where the judge has stepped down to embrace the accused, symbolizing acquittal and peace.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: The journey ends in peace. "Justification" means God declares the sinner righteous. The hostility is gone. There is no longer any condemnation hanging over the believer's head.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a calm sea at dusk, the water perfectly still, reflecting the peaceful colors of the sky.

Slide 24 Practical Application:
*   **Identify:** Do you sense the "carnal" pull toward selfishness?
*   **Confess:** Take it to God immediately.
*   **Believe:** You are a new creation; not defined by your past.
*   **Walk:** Step forward today in the "no condemnation" zone.
