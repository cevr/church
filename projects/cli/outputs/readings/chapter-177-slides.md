Study Title: Subjects of the Kingdom: The Overcomer’s Path

---

Slide 1 Question: Does God expect a Christian to overcome evil, and if so, how is this possible?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.” (Romans 12:21)
“For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.” (1 John 5:4)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Christian life is an active conquest, not a passive wait. We face "the world"—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. Yet, victory is not achieved by human willpower, but by a total reliance on God’s power working through us.

Slide 4 Term Definition: “The World”

In this context, "The World" does not refer to the physical planet. It refers to the system of values, temptations, and rebellious attitudes that stand in opposition to God’s character (1 John 2:15-17).

Slide 5 Illustration: The Swimmer

[ILL] Imagine a swimmer trying to move upstream against a strong current. If they stop swimming, the current sweeps them away. Faith is the connection to a power source—like a rope thrown from the shore—that pulls us against the current of the world.

Slide 6 Question: What does Jesus promise to those who overcome?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son.” (Revelation 21:7)

Slide 9 Did You Know?

[DYK] In ancient courts of law, a "white stone" was sometimes given to an accused person to signify full acquittal or innocence, while a black stone signified guilt. Jesus promises the overcomer the assurance of total forgiveness and acceptance.

Slide 10 Question: Who are the true "Israel" or subjects of God's Kingdom today?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people looking toward the heavens, representing different nations but one faith.

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.” (Galatians 3:29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham looking up at the stars in the night sky, envisioning his spiritual descendants.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: While Abraham's physical descendants were the original custodians of truth, the New Testament reveals that true "Israel" is defined by faith in Jesus Christ. As Paul writes, "They are not all Israel, which are of Israel" (Romans 9:6).

[SN] The name "Israel" was first given to Jacob after he wrestled with God (Genesis 32:28). It means "Prince of God" or "One who prevails with God." Therefore, anyone who "prevails" or overcomes through Christ bears the spiritual significance of the name Israel.

Slide 13 Question: How do those who are not Jewish by birth become part of this Kingdom?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient gardener tending to a large, old olive tree in a grove.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree.” (Romans 11:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fresh, green olive branch being carefully bound to an ancient, sturdy tree trunk.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Paul uses the olive tree illustration. Natural branches (unbelieving Jews) were broken off due to unbelief, while wild branches (Gentiles) are "grafted in" by faith. We draw our spiritual life from God’s covenant root, not our own background.

[ILL] In horticulture, grafting involves taking a branch from one tree and fusing it to the stock of another so they grow as one. When we accept Christ, we are surgically attached to the life-source of God.

Slide 16 Question: How are the faithful subjects of God's Kingdom described in the last days?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of believers standing together in a storm, holding scrolls and looking peaceful.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ten Commandments tablets illuminated by the soft light of a cross in the background.

Slide 18 Deeper Insight: The New Jerusalem

The Holy City reflects the unity of the faithful. The city has twelve gates named after the twelve tribes of Israel, yet its foundations bear the names of the twelve apostles. This signifies that the redeemed host is one united family—God's people from all ages.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a glorious city descending from clouds, showing massive gates and jeweled foundations glowing in divine light.

Slide 19 Practical Application

1. Identify an area in your life where you need to "overcome" (habit, attitude, fear).
2. Claim the promise that "faith is the victory."
3. Remember that your citizenship in heaven is based on your acceptance of Jesus Christ, not your ancestry.
