Study Title: Modern Intemperance: Cleansing the Body Temple

Question: What is the biblical standard regarding our personal purity?

Biblical Answer: “Keep thyself pure.” (1 Timothy 5:22, last clause)

Explanation: The command is brief but comprehensive. It places a responsibility on the individual to maintain their own condition before God.

Question: Does this requirement of purity extend to our physical bodies?

Biblical Answer: “Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.” (2 Corinthians 7:1)

Term Definition: "Filthiness of the flesh" refers to physical habits and practices that defile the body, while "filthiness of the spirit" refers to impurities of the mind and heart. True holiness involves both.

Question: Why does God take the condition of our physical bodies so seriously?

Biblical Answer: “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” (1 Corinthians 3:17)

Explanation: The believer’s body is not their own property to abuse; it is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Introducing harmful substances into the body is an act of defiling God's sanctuary.

[ILL] Imagine a beautiful church dedicated to worship. If someone were to smear filth on the walls or damage the foundation, it would be an insult to the owner. Similarly, our bodies are living sanctuaries; damaging them with poisons insults our Creator.

Question: What specific substances are identified as defiling or poisonous to the body?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.” (2 Corinthians 6:17)

Deeper Insight: While the Bible sets the principle of avoiding the "unclean thing," science confirms what constitutes a physical poison. The text identifies **tobacco** (containing the deadly poison nicotine) and stimulants like **tea and coffee** (containing theine and tannin) as violent poisons.

[DYK] When Columbus discovered Cuba in 1492, his sailors reported seeing natives carrying "firebrands" and puffing smoke, which the sailors thought was a way of perfuming themselves. This "savage" custom of smoking eventually spread to Europe and became a global form of intoxication.

Progressive Disclosure: The text highlights the dangers of these common indulgences:
• **Tobacco**: Contains nicotine, a deadly poison that affects the blood, heart, eyes, and brain.
• **Tea & Coffee**: Contain theine (similar to strychnine) and tannin, which paralyze digestion and cause nervousness, peevishness, and "chronic derangement."

Question: How should a Christian relate to the habits of the world around them?

Biblical Answer: “For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.” (1 Peter 4:3)

Explanation: The "will of the Gentiles" (or the ungodly) is characterized by satisfying the lusts of the flesh. A Christian is called to leave these former habits behind and live according to the will of God.

[SN] Spirit-Led Insight: The Greek concept of "sorcery" (pharmakeia) in the New Testament is often linked to the use of drugs or potions. While not explicitly used in this text, the principle aligns: God's people are to be free from chemical dependency and artificial stimulation, relying instead on the Holy Spirit.

Question: What is the ultimate motivation for purifying ourselves from these habits?

Biblical Answer: “And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself even as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3 - *Note: Cited as 1 John 2:2,3 in source text*)

Explanation: The hope of the Second Coming and seeing Jesus "as He is" drives the believer to prepare. If we hope to live in a perfect, pure eternity, we begin that work of purification now.

Question: What is the final destiny of those who refuse to let go of defiling habits?

Biblical Answer: “And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.” (Revelation 21:21)

Practical Application: To glorify God in our body and spirit (1 Corinthians 6:20) requires a practical response:
• Acknowledging that we are "bought with a price."
• Abstaining from stimulants and narcotics (tobacco, tea, coffee).
• Seeking to be "separate" from the destructive customs of the world.

[ILL] Total abstinence is the only safe path. Just as one would not take "moderate" doses of a known poison like arsenic, the Christian "temple-keeper" avoids all habits that degrade the body's delicate machinery.
