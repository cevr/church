Study Title: The Eternal Nature of God’s Law

---

Slide 1 Question: According to Scripture, what is the standard by which all humanity will be judged?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ... So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.” (2 Corinthians 5:10; James 2:12)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Every person will face judgment, and the standard used is God’s law. James calls it the "law of liberty." While the world views the law as restrictive, the Bible teaches that true freedom is found in living within God's design, free from the slavery of sin.

Slide 4 Insight: The "Law of Liberty"

[DYK] The phrase "law of liberty" suggests that obedience to God is not forced servitude but the free choice of a loving heart. Just as a train is free only when it stays on the tracks, humanity is free only when aligned with moral law.

Slide 5 Question: What is the spiritual condition of humanity in relation to this law?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:19, 23)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The law acts as a diagnostic tool. It silences our excuses and reveals our guilt. Whether religious or secular, all have fallen short of God's glory.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Diagnostic Tool

[ILL] An X-ray machine can reveal a broken bone, but it cannot heal it. In the same way, the Law reveals our sin (the break in our relationship with God), but it points us to the Physician (Jesus) for the cure.

Slide 9 Question: Does having faith in Jesus abolish the need to keep the law?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer looking up toward the heavens with an expression of deep trust and faith.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” (Romans 3:31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of stone tablets resting firmly on a wooden table, not broken but illuminated by a shaft of light.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: Paul anticipates the argument that grace removes the obligation to obey. His answer is emphatic: "God forbid." True faith establishes the law in the heart. Because we are saved by grace, we desire to live in harmony with the God who saved us.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person writing on a scroll with a look of determination and love, symbolizing the law written on the heart.

---

Slide 12 Term Definition: "Make Void"

**"Make void" (Greek: *katargeō*)**
Meaning: To render idle, useless, or to abolish.

Paul argues that faith makes the law effective and active in our lives, not useless.

Slide 13 Question: How long did Jesus say the law would remain in force?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus teaching a crowd on a hillside, gesturing toward the horizon.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “For verily I say into you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.” (Matthew 5:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the earth and sky, vast and enduring, painted in a romantic, historical style.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: Jesus affirms the absolute permanence of the law. As long as the physical heaven and earth exist, the moral law remains binding.

[DYK] A "jot" refers to *yod*, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet. A "tittle" is a tiny decorative stroke. Jesus was saying that not even the smallest stroke of a letter in God's law would disappear.

Slide 16 Question: How is the law summarized?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two stone tablets glowing softly, representing the two tables of the law.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart... And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.” (Matthew 22:37-40)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus embracing a person, while pointing upward to God, symbolizing the dual nature of love.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The Ten Commandments are split into two sections: duty to God and duty to man. Love is not a replacement for the law, but the foundation of it. You cannot truly love God while worshipping idols, nor love your neighbor while stealing from him.

Slide 19 Illustration: The Hinges

[ILL] Think of a door hanging on two hinges. The door represents the specific commandments, and the hinges represent the two principles of love. If you remove the hinges, the door falls. Love and Law are inseparable.

Slide 20 Question: What is the surest evidence that a person truly knows and loves God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a fruit tree bearing rich fruit, symbolizing evidence and growth.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him... For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.” (1 John 2:4; 1 John 5:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle John writing an epistle, with a look of stern but loving instruction.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Profession is not enough. The Apostle John links knowing God directly with obeying Him. Obedience is the fruit of love.

[SN] **Deeper Insight:** The "carnal mind" is hostile to God and cannot obey (Romans 8:7). Therefore, keeping the commandments is supernatural proof that a person has been born again.

---

Slide 23 A Look at the End Times

[SN] **Spirit-led Note:** In Revelation 12:17, the defining characteristic of God’s people in the last days is that they "keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus." This suggests a restoration of the Law in the life of the church before Christ returns.

Slide 24 Practical Application

*   **Review your path:** Does your life reflect the "law of liberty"?
*   **Check your motive:** Do you obey out of fear, or because you love the One who first loved you?
*   **Abide in Him:** To be like Jesus is to walk as He walked—keeping the Father's commandments.
