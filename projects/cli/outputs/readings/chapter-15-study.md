Study Title: The Anchor of the Soul: A Study on Biblical Hope

Question: To what object is the Christian’s hope compared in Scripture?

Biblical Answer: “That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.” (Hebrews 6:18, 19)

Explanation: The Bible likens hope to an anchor. Unlike an anchor on a ship which goes down into the depths of the sea, the Christian’s anchor goes *up* into the sanctuary in heaven, "within the veil," where Jesus is ministering. This provides stability for the soul regardless of the storms of life.

Term Definition: "Immutable" means unchangeable. God’s promise and His oath cannot change; therefore, our hope is not wishful thinking, but a certainty based on God’s character.

[ILL] A ship in a storm is not safe because of the water around it, but because of the anchor holding it to the solid ground beneath. Similarly, a Christian is safe not because their circumstances are calm, but because they are tethered to the unshakeable reality of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.

[SN] The phrase "within the veil" is significant in Adventist theology. It refers to the heavenly sanctuary. Just as the High Priest entered the Most Holy Place, Jesus has entered heaven itself to intercede for us. Our hope is anchored in His priestly work.

Question: What is the specific title given to this expectation?

Biblical Answer: “Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.” (Titus 2:13)

Explanation: The ultimate focus of Christian hope is not merely death or a disembodied state, but the literal, physical return of Jesus Christ. This is called the "Blessed Hope."

[DYK] The term "Blessed Hope" was a favorite among early Advent believers (often called Millerites) and pioneers. It distinguished their belief in a literal, soon-coming Savior from the popular idea of a spiritual millennium of peace on earth before Christ's return.

Question: When did the Apostle Paul expect to receive the reward of his hope?

Biblical Answer: “Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them also that love His appearing.” (2 Timothy 4:8)

Explanation: Paul did not expect to receive his reward immediately at death, but "at that day"—the day of Christ's appearing. The fulfillment of hope is tied to the resurrection and the Second Coming.

Question: By contrast, how does the Bible describe the hope of those who ignore God?

Biblical Answer: “So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be as a spider's web.” (Job 8:13, 14)

Explanation: While the Christian hope is an iron anchor, the hope of the hypocrite is a spider’s web. It may look intricate and structured, but it is fragile and easily swept away when trials come.

Question: Does having this hope change how a person lives their daily life?

Biblical Answer: “And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself, even as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3)

Explanation: Biblical hope is not a sedative; it is a stimulant for holy living. Knowing that we will see Jesus face-to-face motivates us to live lives that reflect His character now.

Progressive Disclosure: • Hope creates joy (Rom 15:13) • Hope leads to patience • Hope results in purity

[ILL] If you knew a King was coming to visit your home tomorrow, you would spend today cleaning and preparing. In the same way, the hope of Christ's return urges us to "clean house" spiritually, removing habits and thoughts that do not align with His purity.

Question: What is the foundation of this "living hope"?

Biblical Answer: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.” (1 Peter 1:3)

Explanation: Our hope is "lively" (living) because it is based on a living Savior. Because Jesus rose from the dead, the promise of our own resurrection and eternal life is guaranteed.

Question: Who will be the hope of the righteous during the final shaking of the earth?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord also shall roar out of Zion... and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the Lord will be the hope of His people, and the strength of the children of Israel.” (Joel 3:16)

Explanation: When earthly supports fail and the world undergoes its final crisis, the Lord Himself becomes the shelter (hope) for His people.

[SN] Connection to Prophecy: This text in Joel parallels the "Time of Trouble" described in Daniel 12:1. SDA pioneers emphasized that in the final days, human governments and earthly security would fail, leaving God’s Word as the only safety for the believer.

Practical Application: How can we cultivate this hope today?
• By studying the prophecies that anchor our faith (Heb 6:19)
• By purifying our lives in anticipation of His return (1 John 3:3)
• By resting in the assurance of the resurrection (1 Peter 1:3)
• By asking the Holy Spirit to fill us with hope (Rom 15:13)

"Be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord." (Psalm 31:24)
