Slide 3 Biblical Answer

**The Answer:**
“For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1)

Slide 4 Explanation

**The Contrast**
Paul uses a vivid contrast between a temporary shelter and a permanent home:
*   **The Tabernacle (Tent):** Our current body—temporary, fragile, and easily taken down.
*   **The Building:** The future body God provides—permanent, sturdy, and eternal.

Slide 5 Did You Know?

**Paul the Tentmaker**
[DYK] Paul himself was a tentmaker by trade (Acts 18:3). When he wrote this, he used imagery from his daily work to explain deep spiritual truths. He knew firsthand that tents wear out and tear, but a solid house stands firm.

Slide 6 Question

**Question:** What is the experience of the believer while living in this "earthly tent"?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer

**The Answer:**
“For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven... For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened...” (2 Corinthians 5:2, 4)

Slide 8 Definition & Illustration

**Understanding the "Groan"**
*   **Definition:** This implies the heaviness of living in a world of suffering and mortality (Romans 8:22).
*   **Illustration:** Imagine living in a tent during a severe storm. The wind shakes the fabric and rain leaks in. You "groan" for the safety of a warm, brick house.

[ILL] We long to trade our frail, mortal bodies for immortal, perfect ones.

Slide 9 Question

**Question:** Does Paul desire to be a disembodied spirit (a "ghost"), or does he desire a resurrected body?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer

**The Answer:**
“Not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.” (2 Corinthians 5:4)

Slide 11 Explanation: Three States

**Paul identifies three states of being:**

1.  **Clothed:** Our current mortal life (in the tent).
2.  **Unclothed (Naked):** The state of death (bodilessness).
3.  **Clothed Upon:** The future immortal life (the building from God).

Paul's desire is *not* to be a spirit without a body, but to be "clothed upon" with a glorified body.

Slide 12 Progressive Disclosure

**Summary of Symbols**

*   The "Tent" = **Mortality**
*   "Nakedness" = **Death**
*   The "House" = **Immortality**

The goal is not to lose the body, but to perfect it.

Slide 13 Question

**Question:** When does this change—where mortality is "swallowed up of life"—actually happen?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer

**The Answer:**
“Behold, I show you a mystery... we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump... for this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Corinthians 15:51-53)

---

Slide 15 Explanation & Note

**The Timing**
The "swallowing up of mortality" happens at the **Second Coming of Jesus** (the last trump). It is an event of resurrection, not the moment of death.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: If a believer received their "house" (immortality) immediately at death, the resurrection would be redundant. Paul’s theology consistently points to the redemption of the body at Christ's return.

Slide 16 Question

**Question:** If the reward is future, why does Paul say "we have" a building of God in the present tense?

Slide 17 Biblical Answer & Insight

**The Certainty of the Promise**
“And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.” (1 John 5:11)

**Explanation:** A promise from God is so certain that Scripture often speaks of it as already possessed. We "have" it by faith, secured in Jesus, reserved for us.

Slide 18 Question

**Question:** What does Paul mean when he speaks of being "absent from the body" and "present with the Lord"?

Slide 19 Biblical Answer

**The Answer:**
“We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 5:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a peaceful face looking upward, eyes full of hope and trust.

---

Slide 20 Explanation

**The Believer's Preference**
Paul is expressing a preference for the eternal state over the mortal state. Between the "groaning" of this life and the "glory" of the next, the believer would always choose to be present with the Lord.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a path leading up a mountain toward a sunrise, symbolizing the journey to the eternal state.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight

**Perception of Time**
For the believer who dies, the next conscious moment is seeing the Lord. The "sleep" of death (1 Thess 4:13-14) passes instantly in their perception.

Thus, the transition from the "earthly tent" to the "heavenly house" feels instantaneous to the one who sleeps in Jesus.

Slide 22 Application

**Practical Application**
How does this view of the future affect us today?

*   It gives purpose to our "groaning"—pain is temporary.
*   It validates the physical body—God intends to redeem it.
*   It centers our hope on the Return of Christ—when we are finally "clothed upon."
