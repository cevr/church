Study Title: Christ: The True Goal of the Law

Question: To the believer, what does Christ become in relation to the law?

Biblical Answer: “For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth.” (Romans 10:4)

Explanation: This text is often misunderstood to mean that Christ abolished the law. However, the word "end" here signifies the destination or the goal, rather than a termination. Christ is what the law points to; He is the realization of everything the law requires.

Term Definition: **End (Greek: *Telos*)**: This word often means the object, intention, design, or final goal. It is the point at which a thing reaches its full potential or purpose.

[DYK] The Greek word *telos* is where we get the English word "telescope"—an instrument used to look at a distant object or goal.

Question: How does Scripture elsewhere use the word "end" to mean "purpose" or "outcome"?

Biblical Answer: “Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord.” (James 5:11)

Explanation: In the story of Job, the "end of the Lord" does not mean that the Lord ceased to exist. Rather, it refers to the *purpose* or the benevolent *outcome* God had in mind for Job. Similarly, the "end" of the law is the benevolent purpose God has for us through His commandments.

[ILL] Consider a roadmap. The "end" of the map is the destination itself. Once you arrive at the destination, you haven't destroyed the map; you have fulfilled its purpose. Christ is the destination; the law is the map that guides us to Him.

Question: What was the original object or design of the law?

Biblical Answer: “And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.” (Romans 7:10)

**Further Answer:** “Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart.” (1 Timothy 1:5)

Explanation: The law was originally designed to bring life and to produce "charity" (love) from a pure heart. It was never meant to be a burden, but a description of a life lived in harmony with God.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** The connection between "Law" and "Love" is vital in SDA theology. Ellen White often described the law as a "transcript of God's character." Since God is Love (1 John 4:8), His law is a law of love. The "end" (goal) of the commandment is simply to restore the image of Love in the human heart.

Question: How does the Bible define this "charity" or "love" that the law requires?

Biblical Answer: “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.” (Romans 13:10; see also 1 John 5:3)

Explanation: Love is not merely a feeling; it is an active principle that does no harm. When one loves completely—loving God and neighbor—they are naturally keeping the law.

Question: If the law is good, why did God need to send His Son?

Biblical Answer: “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us.” (Romans 8:3, 4)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **The Problem:** The law is perfect, but it is "weak through the flesh." A mirror can show you your dirty face, but it cannot wash it. The law reveals sin but cannot cure it because our sinful nature ("the flesh") cannot obey it.
2.  **The Solution:** God sent Christ in the likeness of our flesh to conquer sin where we could not.
3.  **The Result:** Christ provides the power so that the righteousness of the law is fulfilled *in* us, not just *for* us.

[ILL] Imagine a swimmer drowning in a stormy sea. A rule book on the shore says, "Swim to survive." The rule is correct, but it cannot help the drowning man. He is too "weak." He needs a Lifeguard to jump in, save him, and bring him to the shore. The law is the rule; Christ is the Lifeguard.

Deeper Insight: Note that the text says the righteousness of the law is fulfilled *in* us. This indicates that the plan of salvation is not just to forgive the past, but to transform the character so that the believer actually begins to live out the principles of the law through the power of Christ.

Question: What, then, are we enabled to do through Christ?

Biblical Answer: “That the requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us.” (Romans 8:4, Revised Version Margin)

Explanation: Through faith in Jesus, the believer enters into the experience where the "end" (goal) of the law—a life of love and righteousness—becomes a reality. We do not abolish the law; we establish it by letting Christ live His life through us.

Practical Application: How does this change our view of obedience?
*   We stop trying to earn salvation by following rules (legalism).
*   We stop ignoring the rules because we are "under grace" (antinomianism).
*   We look to Jesus as the *Goal*. When we have Him, we have the righteousness that the law demands.
*   Our obedience becomes a fruit of salvation, not a root of it.
