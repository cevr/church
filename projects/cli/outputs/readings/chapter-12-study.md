Study Title: Prophecies of the Promised One

Question: In what words did Moses speak of the coming Messiah, and how do we know this referred to Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, unto Him ye shall hearken.” (Deuteronomy 18:15)

Confirmation: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you... Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after... have likewise foretold of these days.” (Acts 3:22, 24)

Explanation: Moses was the great deliverer and lawgiver of Israel. He prophesied that God would raise up another Prophet "like unto me"—a deliverer from the bondage of sin. The Apostle Peter confirms in Acts that Jesus is the fulfillment of this ancient promise.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** Consider the parallels between Moses and Christ:
• Both were preserved from slaughter as infants.
• Both renounced a royal court to help their brethren.
• Both fasted for 40 days.
• Both established a covenant between God and His people.
• Both interceded for the people when they sinned.

Question: Where was the Messiah to be born, and how was this fulfilled?

Biblical Answer: “But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall He come forth unto Me that is to be ruler in Israel.” (Micah 5:2)

Fulfillment: “Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king.” (Matthew 2:1)

[DYK] Bethlehem means "House of Bread." It is fitting that Jesus, who called Himself the "Bread of Life" (John 6:35), was born in a place named for sustenance.

Question: Under what striking emblem did Balaam prophesy of Christ?

Biblical Answer: “There shall come a Star out of Jacob and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel.” (Numbers 24:17)

New Testament Affirmation: “I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.” (Revelation 22:16)

Explanation: The "Star" represents light and guidance, while the "Scepter" represents kingly authority. In the New Testament, Jesus claims this title for Himself. Interestingly, a literal star guided the wise men to His birthplace (Matthew 2:1-2).

Question: How was the Messiah’s ministry and reception described by the prophet Isaiah?

Biblical Answer: “He is despised and rejected of men; a Man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief... He was despised, and we esteemed Him not.” (Isaiah 53:3)

Fulfillment: “He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.” (John 1:11)

Term Definition: **"Man of Sorrows"**: This title indicates that Jesus did not live a life of ease. He bore the weight of human sin and felt the depth of human sadness, allowing Him to sympathize fully with our weaknesses.

[ILL] Imagine a doctor who not only prescribes a cure but contracts the disease to understand the patient's pain. Jesus entered into our sorrow so He could effectively heal it.

Question: What specific details regarding the crucifixion were foretold centuries in advance?

Biblical Answer: 
1. **Silence on Trial:** “He was oppressed... yet He opened not His mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter.” (Isaiah 53:7)
2. **Mockery and Drink:** “They gave Me also gall for My meat; and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink.” (Psalm 69:21)
3. **Gambling for Clothes:** “They part My garments among them, and cast lots upon My vesture.” (Psalm 22:18)

Explanation: These are not vague predictions; they are specific circumstances enacted by Roman soldiers who had likely never read the Hebrew prophets. Matthew records that they cast lots for His coat, offered Him vinegar, and that He remained silent before Pilate, fulfilling every word.

Deeper Insight: The reference to the "lamb to the slaughter" connects the death of Jesus directly to the Sanctuary service. Just as the innocent lamb died for the sinner in the Old Testament ritual, Christ, the true Lamb of God, remained silent and submissive to save humanity.

Question: What was predicted regarding the burial of the Messiah?

Biblical Answer: “And He made His grave with the wicked, and with the rich in His death.” (Isaiah 53:9)

Fulfillment: “A rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph... begged the body of Jesus... and laid it in His own new tomb.” (Matthew 27:57-60)

Explanation: Although Jesus died a criminal’s death ("with the wicked"), God’s providence ensured He was buried with honor in a rich man’s tomb, exactly as Isaiah predicted.

[SN] **Historical Context:** In Roman custom, victims of crucifixion were often left on the cross or thrown into a common grave for criminals. The intervention of Joseph of Arimathea was a deviation from standard procedure, yet it was necessary to fulfill Scripture.

Practical Application: If God so accurately fulfilled the prophecies regarding Christ’s first coming—down to the town of His birth and the drink offered at His death—we can have absolute confidence that His promises regarding the Second Coming and the restoration of all things will also come to pass. We can trust the Word of God to guide our lives today.
