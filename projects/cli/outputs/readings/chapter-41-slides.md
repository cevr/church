Study Title: Unlocking the Prophetic History of the World

---

Slide 1 Question: When human wisdom fails to reveal the future, where must we turn?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “There is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days.” (Daniel 2:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel standing confidently yet humbly before the king, pointing upward toward a ray of soft light entering the throne room.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: King Nebuchadnezzar had a disturbing dream but forgot the details. His astrologers admitted that only gods "whose dwelling is not with flesh" could reveal it. Daniel directed the king away from human failure to the God of heaven who holds the future.

[DYK] In ancient Babylon, dreams were considered messages from the gods. By forgetting the dream yet demanding its interpretation, God exposed the limitations of pagan sorcery, setting the stage for the true God to be revealed.

Slide 4 Question: What was the object seen in the dream, and what did its head of gold represent?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image... This image's head was of fine gold... Thou art this head of gold.” (Daniel 2:31-32, 38)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on the head of a majestic statue, gleaming with pure gold, reflecting a soft, warm light.

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The image represents a timeline of history beginning with Nebuchadnezzar. Babylon, famous for its immense wealth and splendor, is fittingly represented by the most precious metal, gold.

---

Slide 7 Term Definition: “Image” refers to a statue. In this prophecy, the metal body parts represent a succession of world empires. As the metals change from gold to iron, they decrease in value but increase in hardness and strength.

Slide 8 Question: How does the Bible identify the kingdoms of silver and brass that would follow Babylon?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the chest and arms of the statue, made of shining silver, contrasting with the gold head above.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians.” (Daniel 5:28); “The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. And the rough goat is the king of Grecia.” (Daniel 8:20-21)

---

Slide 10 Explanation: We do not need to guess. Comparing Scripture with Scripture identifies the successors:
*   **Chest/Arms of Silver:** The Medo-Persian Empire.
*   **Belly/Thighs of Brass:** The Empire of Greece.

[ILL] Think of a relay race. The "baton" of world dominance was passed from Babylon to Medo-Persia, and then to Greece. This prophecy was given centuries before these transitions occurred, proving the divine authorship of the Bible.

Slide 11 Question: What is the fourth kingdom, described as "strong as iron"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the legs of the statue, made of dark, solid iron, looking heavy and unbreakable.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things...” (Daniel 2:40)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Roman centurions marching in formation, their iron armor and standards glinting in the sun.

---

Slide 13 Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **The Symbol:** Iron legs—strong, crushing, and durable.
2.  **The History:** This represents the Roman Empire.
3.  **The Proof:** Luke 2:1 records that "Caesar Augustus" taxed the world. Rome was the universal power when Christ was born.

[SN] It is significant that the legs are the longest part of the image, suggesting this fourth power would have a longer duration of dominance than the previous three.

Slide 14 Question: What does the mixture of iron and clay in the feet represent, and what is the final outcome of history?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the feet of the statue, showing a brittle texture of dark iron mixed with pottery clay.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “The kingdom shall be divided... And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed... it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand forever.” (Daniel 2:41, 44)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a rugged stone hurtling through the air towards the feet of the statue, surrounded by a supernatural glow.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The feet represent the divided nations of modern Europe and the world—some strong (iron) and some weak (clay). They will never fully unite again. The next major event is the "stone cut without hands" striking the image.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The "stone cut without hands" indicates a kingdom not of human origin. Earthly empires rise and fall through politics and war, but the final kingdom is established supernaturally by God. This points to the Second Coming of Christ.

---

Slide 18 Practical Application: Just as Daniel remained calm and prayerful in the face of death, trusting that God holds the future, we can have peace. The God who predicted the rise and fall of four great empires controls the "latter days." We can trust the "Stone" to be our solid rock.
