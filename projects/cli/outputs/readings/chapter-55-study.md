Study Title: The Seven Seals: History Foretold

Question: What symbol represents the beginning of the Christian era under the first seal?

Biblical Answer: “And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals,... a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.” (Revelation 6:1, 2)

Explanation: In Bible prophecy, a horse is a symbol of battle or movement. The color white represents purity. This symbol describes the apostolic church of the first century—pure in doctrine and "conquering" the world with the Gospel message.

[DYK] In Roman history, a general returning from a great victory would ride a white horse in a triumphal procession. This imagery fits Christ’s church going forward victoriously in its early years.

Question: How does the symbol change under the second seal?

Biblical Answer: “...there went out another horse that was red: and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another...” (Revelation 6:3, 4)

Explanation: The color changes from white (purity) to red (blood or corruption). This represents the period following the apostles when worldliness entered the church. As the church sought power and alliance with the state (culminating in the time of Constantine), the peace of the pure Gospel was lost to internal strife and external compromise.

[ILL] Imagine a clear stream of water. If you mix in red clay, it becomes murky and undrinkable. Similarly, when the "clay" of secular politics mixed with the "water" of life, the church’s purity was compromised.

Question: What condition of the church is revealed by the third seal?

Biblical Answer: “And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.” (Revelation 6:5)

Explanation: Black is the opposite of white; this represents spiritual darkness. This period covers the time from Constantine to the establishment of the Papacy (A.D. 538). During this time, errors, superstition, and human philosophy replaced the plain teachings of the Bible.

Term Definition: "Balances" or scales often represent judgment or commerce. Here, religion became a matter of transaction rather than faith, and the truth was "weighed" against human tradition and found wanting.

Question: What is the result of this spiritual darkness under the fourth seal?

Biblical Answer: “...behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them... to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death...” (Revelation 6:7, 8)

Explanation: The "pale" color describes the sickly, yellowish look of a blighted plant. This represents the era of intense persecution from A.D. 538 through the Dark Ages. As the Roman Church exercised civil power, "Death" followed for those who dared to disagree with established dogmas.

Question: Upon the opening of the fifth seal, what was seen?

Biblical Answer: “I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.” (Revelation 6:9)

Explanation: This scene takes place during the Reformation. As Reformers began exposing the errors of the past, the memory of the millions of martyrs "cried out" for justice. This is not a literal picture of ghosts under a physical altar, but a symbolic personification—just as God told Cain that Abel's blood "cried" from the ground (Genesis 4:10).

Deeper Insight: The martyrs were given "white robes" (Rev 6:11), signifying that although they died as branded "heretics" by the church of their day, they are accounted as righteous by God. They "rest" in the grave until the resurrection.

Question: What specific physical signs mark the opening of the sixth seal?

Biblical Answer: “...lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood; And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth...” (Revelation 6:12, 13)

Explanation: We interpret these as specific historical events that signaled the approaching end:
1.  **The Great Earthquake:** The Lisbon Earthquake of November 1, 1755, which shook 4 million square miles.
2.  ** The Dark Day:** May 19, 1780, a day of supernatural darkness in New England.
3.  **Falling Stars:** The spectacular meteoric shower of November 13, 1833.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The precision of prophecy is startling. Jesus predicted that the sun would be darkened "immediately after the tribulation" of the persecuting days (Matthew 24:29). Persecution largely ended by the mid-18th century, and the signs followed in exact order: earthquake (1755), darkness (1780), and falling stars (1833).

Question: What is the very next event to happen under the sixth seal?

Biblical Answer: “And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together: and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.” (Revelation 6:14)

Explanation: We are currently living between verse 13 (the falling stars) and verse 14. The next great scene in this prophetic line is the physical dissolution of earthly structures at the coming of Christ.

Question: What happens when the seventh seal is finally opened?

Biblical Answer: “And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.” (Revelation 8:1)

Explanation: The seventh seal marks the Second Coming itself. Why is there silence in heaven? Because the angelic hosts have left the heavenly courts to accompany Jesus to earth (Matthew 25:31). Heaven is silent because it is empty; the focus of the universe is on the return of the King.

Term Definition: "Half an hour" in prophetic time. In prophecy, a day represents a year (Ezekiel 4:6).
*   1 prophetic day = 1 literal year (360 days).
*   1 hour is 1/24th of a day.
*   Therefore, a prophetic hour is about 15 days.
*   A "half hour" represents approximately seven days—the time it may take for the journey of Christ and His angels to earth and back.

Practical Application: We have seen the history of the church turn from purity (white) to compromise (red) to darkness (black) and persecution (pale). We have seen the signs in the heavens fulfilled. We stand now on the brink of the "silence in heaven." Are we ready for the King to arrive?
