Study Title: The Penalty for Transgression: Past, Present, and Future

Question: Under the ancient civil laws of Israel, how were severe sins like idolatry, blasphemy, and adultery punished?

Biblical Answer:
*   **Idolatry:** “And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God...” (Deut. 13:6-10)
*   **Blasphemy:** “And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him...” (Lev. 24:16)
*   **Adultery:** “The adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.” (Lev. 20:10)
*   **Rebellion:** “If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son... all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die.” (Deut. 21:18-21)

Explanation: In the "old dispensation" (the time of the Old Testament), Israel was a theocracy—a nation where God was the direct civil Ruler. These harsh penalties were civil laws designed to protect the community from the spreading "infection" of idolatry and moral collapse. They demonstrate the extreme seriousness of sin in the eyes of a holy God.

[DYK] In these ancient cases, the "congregation" or "men of the city" participated in the punishment. This was not a secret execution by a king, but a public purging of evil to ensure the community realized the gravity of turning away from the Source of Life.

[ILL] Think of a quarantine. When a deadly, contagious virus appears, strict measures are taken to isolate and remove the threat to save the population. In the camp of Israel, open rebellion and idolatry were treated as a deadly spiritual plague that had to be stopped before it destroyed the whole nation.

Question: Since we no longer stone sinners today, has the ultimate penalty for sin been abolished?

Biblical Answer: “For the wages of sin is death.” (Rom. 6:23)

Explanation: The *method* of civil punishment has changed, but the spiritual *result* of sin remains the same. Sin cuts a person off from God, who is the only source of life. Therefore, the inevitable result—the "wage"—of clinging to sin is the cessation of life.

Term Definition: **Wages** (Greek: *opsōnion*). This term referred to the payment given to a soldier or servant. It implies something earned or deserved. We earn death by our sinful nature and choices; we receive eternal life as a free gift (the rest of Romans 6:23).

Question: Why do gospel ministers and the church not execute these death penalties today?

Biblical Answer: “Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us.” (2 Cor. 5:20)

Explanation: We are now in the "Gospel dispensation." The church is not a civil government with the power of the sword. Instead, followers of Jesus are "ambassadors"—representatives sent into a foreign land to deliver a message of peace and reconciliation. An ambassador does not execute criminals; he delivers the King's offer of pardon.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Tangent:** The shift from "executioner" to "ambassador" highlights the time of probation we live in now. God is holding back the winds of strife and judgment to allow the Gospel to go to the whole world. The sword of steel has been replaced by the Sword of the Spirit (the Word of God), which cuts to the heart to save, rather than to the body to kill.

Question: If the church does not punish sin, who does vengeance belong to?

Biblical Answer: “Vengeance is Mine. I will repay, saith the Lord.” (Rom. 12:19)

Explanation: Justice has not been forgotten; it has been deferred to the One who can judge perfectly. Humans often judge by appearance, but God judges the heart. Therefore, the right to execute final justice belongs solely to Him.

Question: Who has been given the specific authority to execute this final judgment, and when will it happen?

Biblical Answer:
*   **The Judge:** “For as the Father hath life in Himself... hath given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man.” (John 5:26, 27)
*   **The Time:** “Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of His saints, to execute judgment upon all.” (Jude 14-15)

Explanation: The Father has committed all judgment to Jesus, the Son. Because Jesus lived as a man ("Son of Man"), He is a sympathetic and fair Judge. He understands our temptations. This judgment is not executed now, but at His Second Coming. Until then, the door of mercy remains open.

Deeper Insight: The text in Jude quotes Enoch, "the seventh from Adam." This shows that the plan of final judgment was known even by the earliest patriarchs. They understood that while sin might flourish for a time, a day of reckoning is coming when the Lord will set the universe right.

[ILL] A courtroom trial often has a long period of gathering evidence before the verdict is read and the sentence carried out. We are currently in the time where the evidence is being shown—God's character vs. Satan's rebellion. When Jesus returns, the court session ends, and the executive judgment begins.

Practical Application:
1.  **Reverence:** We should not take sin lightly just because judgment isn't immediate.
2.  **Mission:** As ambassadors, our job is to warn the world and offer God's peace while there is time.
3.  **Trust:** We can let go of personal revenge, knowing that Jesus will handle all injustice perfectly in the end.
