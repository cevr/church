Study Title: The Blessed Hope: Christ's Return

Question: What comforting promise did Jesus give regarding the future?

Biblical Answer: “Let not your heart be troubled... In My Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto Myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.” (John 14:1-3)

Explanation: Jesus assures His followers that His departure is not permanent. He is currently preparing a dwelling place for His people. The purpose of His return is relational: He comes back so that we may be physically present with Him forever.

[DYK] In ancient Jewish wedding customs, the groom would leave his father's house to prepare a bridal chamber. He would not return for his bride until the room was ready and his father gave the approval. Jesus uses this intimate imagery to describe His return for the church.

Question: How will Jesus return? Will it be a secret or spiritual event?

Biblical Answer: “...This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen Him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:11)
“Behold, He cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see Him...” (Revelation 1:7)

Explanation: The angels at the ascension emphasized that the *same* Jesus (flesh and bone) would return in the *same manner* (visible, literal, and physical). It is not a secret event; Revelation confirms that "every eye" will witness it.

[ILL] Lightning cannot be hidden; it flashes across the entire sky. Similarly, Jesus said His coming would be like lightning shining from the east to the west (Matthew 24:27). It will be the most public event in human history.

Question: What will be the condition of society just before He returns?

Biblical Answer: “But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage... and knew not until the flood came...” (Matthew 24:37-39)

Explanation: Jesus describes a world absorbed in the routine affairs of this life. Eating, drinking, and marrying are not sinful in themselves, but they become dangerous when they distract us from spiritual realities. The world will be taken by surprise, not because there were no warnings, but because they were too busy to notice them.

Term Definition: “Surfeiting” (Luke 21:34) refers to the giddiness, headache, or mental fog caused by overindulgence in eating or drinking. It represents a state of mind that is numb to spiritual danger.

Question: How does the Bible describe the reaction of those who have waited for Him?

Biblical Answer: “And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.” (Isaiah 25:9)

Contrast: While the unprepared mourn and hide (Revelation 6:15-17), the righteous recognize Him as the God they have known, loved, and waited for.

[SN] Spirit-led Note: The phrase "This is our God" implies recognition. You cannot recognize someone coming down the road unless you have spent time with them before. Those who rejoice at His coming are those who have cultivated a relationship with Him daily through prayer and Scripture.

Question: Since we do not know the exact hour, what should our attitude be?

Biblical Answer: “Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it... Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts...” (James 5:7-8)
“And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3)

Explanation: We are called to active patience—like a farmer ("husbandman") working the soil while waiting for the harvest. This "Blessed Hope" (Titus 2:13) is a motivating force. It leads us to purify our lives, moving away from sin and establishing our hearts in grace, so that we are ready to meet Him.

Deeper Insight: The "delay" of the master mentioned in Matthew 24:48 often reveals the true character of the servant. If we only behave well because we think the Master is watching *right now*, our heart is not right. True preparation is a change of character that remains faithful regardless of how long the wait seems.

Practical Application: If you knew a strictly honored guest would arrive at your home today, but you didn't know the exact minute, how would you prepare?
• You would tidy the house (Confession/Repentance).
• You would watch the window (Expectancy).
• You would not start a project that would distract you (Priorities).
Christ asks us to live in this state of joyful readiness today.
