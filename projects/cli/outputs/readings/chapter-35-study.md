Study Title: Our Pattern, Helper, and Friend

Question: How should a Christian determine how to live their daily life?

Biblical Answer: “He that saith he abideth in Him ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked.” (1 John 2:6)

Explanation: The Christian life is not merely about following a set of abstract rules, but following a Person. To "walk as He walked" means our lifestyle, decisions, and reactions should mirror the life of Jesus Christ.

[ILL] Imagine trying to learn a complex craft like woodworking. You can read a manual, or you can watch a master craftsman work and mimic his movements. Jesus is the Master Craftsman of life; we learn by watching and imitating Him.

Question: What specific examples did Jesus set for us in His earthly life?

Biblical Answer:
*   **In Obedience:** “And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.” (Luke 2:51)
*   **In Baptism:** “Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.” (Matthew 3:15)
*   **In Prayer:** “He went out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.” (Luke 6:12)
*   **In Service:** “Who went about doing good.” (Acts 10:38)

Progressive Disclosure: Jesus did not exempt Himself from human duties. He honored His parents, participated in religious rites (baptism) to set a standard for us, relied on prayer for strength, and spent His energy serving others.

[DYK] In Jewish culture, a son was expected to learn his father’s trade and uphold the family honor. Jesus, though the Creator of the universe, submitted to the authority of Joseph and Mary, sanctifying the ordinary duties of family life.

Question: How did Jesus respond when He was mistreated?

Biblical Answer: “Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously.” (1 Peter 2:23)

Explanation: Jesus broke the cycle of retaliation. Instead of defending Himself or striking back, He trusted the Father’s ultimate justice. He even prayed for His executioners: "Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).

Question: Is Jesus only an example, or does He actively help us?

Biblical Answer: “For in that He himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succour them that are tempted.” (Hebrews 2:18)

Term Definition: "Succour" is an older English word meaning "to run to the aid of" or "to bring help to." It implies urgent, active assistance when someone is in distress or danger.

Deeper Insight: Because Jesus took on human nature, He knows exactly what temptation *feels* like. He is not a distant observer; He is an experienced veteran of the spiritual war who rushes to help us when we are under fire.

Question: How complete is the salvation Jesus offers?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore he is able to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them.” (Hebrews 7:25)

Explanation: "To the uttermost" means entirely, completely, and for all time. There is no depth of sin He cannot reach, and no duration of time where His power fades. His salvation includes "keeping you from falling" and presenting you "faultless" (Jude 24).

[SN] The phrase "ever liveth to make intercession" points to Christ's current work in the heavenly sanctuary. Just as the high priest in the Old Testament bore the names of the tribes on his breastplate, Jesus bears our names before the Father today. This was a central theme for the SDA pioneers—that we have a living Friend in the court of heaven.

Question: How does Jesus define His relationship with His followers?

Biblical Answer: “Henceforth I call you not servants... I have called you friends.” (John 15:15)

Explanation: A servant obeys out of obligation; a friend acts out of love and shared purpose. Jesus invites us into a relationship of intimacy where He shares His plans (the "mind of Christ") with us.

[ILL] A "fair-weather friend" disappears when trouble starts. But Scripture says Jesus is a friend that "sticketh closer than a brother" (Proverbs 18:24) and is "born for adversity" (Proverbs 17:17). He is most present when life is hardest.

Practical Application: Since Jesus is our Pattern, Helper, and Friend:
*   **Pattern:** In a difficult situation today, ask, "How would Jesus handle this?"
*   **Helper:** When tempted, claim His promise to "succour" you immediately.
*   **Friend:** Speak to Him often, not just formally, but as a close companion walking by your side.
