Study Title: The Creator is Our Redeemer

Slide 1 Question: What distinguishes the true God from all false gods in Scripture?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth... The portion of Jacob is not like them, for he is the former of all things... The Lord of hosts is His name.” (Jeremiah 10:11-16)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible draws a sharp contrast. A false god is anything worshipped that did not originate life. The true God is identified specifically as the "Former of all things." His authority to rule is rooted in His power to create.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? [DYK]: In the ancient Near East, gods were often associated with forces of nature (sun, storm, fertility). The Bible is unique in claiming its God is outside of nature and created it entirely from nothing.

Slide 5 Question: Who was the active agent in the Creation of the world?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1:1-3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scroll unrolling to reveal light, merging into a scene of creation.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The "Word" refers to Jesus Christ (see John 1:14). Creation was not a distant act; God created the world *through* Jesus. The Saviour who died on the cross is the same Person who spoke the universe into existence.

Slide 8 Question: How does the Bible link God’s power to create with His power to save us?

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and He that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine.” (Isaiah 43:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient father embracing a returned son, representing redemption and ownership.

---

Slide 10 Progressive Disclosure:
1. **Creation** – He made you.
2. **Formation** – He shaped you.
3. **Redemption** – He bought you back.
4. **Ownership** – "Thou art Mine."

Because He made us, He claims the right to save us. Redemption is a restoration of ownership by the Maker.

Slide 11 Illustration [ILL]: If a complex mechanism is broken, you do not take it to a carpenter; you take it to the maker. Only the one who designed the mechanism knows how to perfectly restore it. Likewise, only our Creator can fix the brokenness of the human heart.

Slide 12 Question: Does the Bible describe salvation as a creative act?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King David kneeling in a stone chamber, looking upward with a repentant expression.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” (Psalm 51:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a glowing light entering a human chest, dispelling shadow, symbolic of a new heart.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: King David, seeking forgiveness, used the word "create." He understood that he didn't just need improvement; he needed a brand-new heart. Salvation is the power of creation applied to the soul.

Slide 15 Term Definition: "Workmanship"
*Greek: Poiema (root of "Poem")*

In Ephesians 2:10, we are called His "workmanship." You are God’s work of art, being re-sculpted by Jesus.

Slide 16 Question: If God has the power to hold the stars in place, what can He do for us?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing on a hill at night, gazing up at a dense, starry sky with awe.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things... not one faileth.” (Isaiah 40:26)

“Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy.” (Jude 24)

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The same invisible energy that keeps the planets in orbit is available to the believer. This power keeps us from "falling" into sin. God does not wind up the universe and walk away; He sustains it moment by moment. He sustains our spiritual life in the same way.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of divine hands gently cradling a planetary orbit, symbolizing care and sustaining power.

---

Slide 19 Speaker Note [SN]: Early Adventist pioneers viewed the "laws of nature" and the "moral law" as originating from the same Lawgiver. To them, a violation of physical law (health) or moral law (Commandments) was a violation of the Creator's design. The power to obey both comes from the Creator Himself.

Slide 20 Question: What sign did God give to remind us that He is both our Creator and our Sanctifier (Redeemer)?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sunset over an olive grove, marking the transition into a day of rest.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, and hallowed it.” (Exodus 20:11)

“Moreover also I gave them My sabbaths, to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them.” (Ezekiel 20:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient family sitting together in peace and rest, bathed in soft afternoon light.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: The Sabbath serves a dual purpose:
1. **Backward Look:** Reminds us we are created beings.
2. **Inward Look:** Reminds us only the Creator can make us holy.

Resting is an act of faith, acknowledging we rely on God's work, not our own.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person at rest, eyes closed in prayer, with a chaotic busy city scene faded in the background.

---

Slide 23 Deeper Insight: The denial of a literal Creation often leads to a denial of the Gospel. If man is rising upward from a primal state through his own effort, he needs no Redeemer. If man fell from a perfect creation, he requires a Creator to restore him. The Gospel is "Creation Regained."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Garden of Eden, lush and perfect, with a soft light suggesting restoration.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: Where do you feel "broken" or unable to change yourself today?
• A habit you can't break?
• A temper you can't control?
• A past you can't heal?

The One who spoke light into darkness says, "I make all things new." Ask Him to *create* a new spirit within you right now.
