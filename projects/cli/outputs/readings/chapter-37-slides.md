---

Slide 1 Question: Where do we first see the Holy Spirit at work in Scripture?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” (Genesis 1:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Spirit of God depicted as a radiant, hovering presence moving across turbulent waters, bringing calm and light.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Before God spoke the world into order, the Spirit was present. The Spirit is the active agent of creation, bringing life and structure out of chaos.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The Hebrew word for "moved" (*rachaph*) describes a hovering or brooding motion, similar to a mother bird fluttering over her nest. It implies affectionate protection and readiness to bring forth life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on a bird nesting in a rocky cleft, sheltering its young, symbolizing protective care.

Slide 5 Question: Did Jesus rely on the Holy Spirit during His earthly ministry?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing in a quiet landscape, looking upward in prayer, bathed in a gentle shaft of light from heaven.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.” (Matthew 12:28)
“For Christ also hath once suffered for sins... being put to death in the flesh, but quickened [made alive] by the Spirit.” (1 Peter 3:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus performing a miracle, His hand outstretched, with a visible aura of divine power surrounding Him.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Although Jesus was divine, He lived as a man dependent on God. He performed miracles and was raised from the dead through the power of the Holy Spirit. This sets the pattern for our lives—dependency on that same Spirit.

[ILL] Imagine a master surgeon (Jesus) using a precise instrument (the Spirit) to heal. Even the Master works through the agency of His Spirit to accomplish the miraculous.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus healing a blind man, focused intently on the act of restoration, soft light illuminating the moment of healing.

---

Slide 8 Question: How does the Spirit affect the heart of a person who does not yet know God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man standing alone in a marketplace, looking thoughtful and conflicted, as if pondering a deep truth.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “And when He [the Spirit] is come, He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.” (John 16:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a light shining into a darkened room, revealing dust and objects previously hidden in the shadows.

---

Slide 10 Term Definition: **Reprove**
To convict, to expose, or to bring a realization of truth to the conscience. It is the Spirit’s job to show us our need for a Savior.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure kneeling in repentance, bathed in a beam of light, expression showing realization and humility.

---

Slide 11 Question: Once a person believes, what work does the Spirit perform inside them?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of early believers gathered together, faces peaceful and illuminated by lamp light.

---

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth.” (2 Thessalonians 2:13)
“And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that He may abide with you for ever.” (John 14:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two figures walking together on a road, one comforting and guiding the other, symbolizing companionship.

---

Slide 13 Explanation: The Spirit does not leave us after conversion. He acts as a "Comforter" (a helper or advocate) and begins the work of "sanctification"—the daily process of making us holy and Christ-like.

[SN] The word "Comforter" (*Parakletos*) refers to one called to walk alongside another. This emphasizes that the Spirit is not an abstract force, but a personal presence representing Jesus to the believer.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a potter gently shaping a clay vessel on a wheel, symbolizing the work of sanctification.

---

Slide 14 Question: How did we get the Bible, and what is its connection to the Spirit?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scroll resting on a wooden table, illuminated by a nearby oil lamp.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21)
“And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (Ephesians 6:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an Old Testament prophet writing on parchment, looking up as if listening to a divine voice.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The Bible is not just a book of human ideas. The Spirit "moved" the prophets to write. Consequently, the Bible is the "Sword" the Spirit uses to cut through lies and defend the truth.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a glowing sword resting upon an open Bible, symbolizing truth and spiritual power.

---

Slide 17 Did You Know? The phrase "moved by the Holy Ghost" uses a Greek term often used for a ship being carried along by the wind. The writers raised their sails (their willingness), and the Spirit provided the direction and power.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient sailing ship on the sea, sails billowing full with a strong wind pushing it forward.

---

Slide 18 Question: Was the gift of prophecy and visions limited only to Old Testament times?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse group of people—young and old—looking up towards the sky with expressions of wonder.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.” (Acts 2:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the day of Pentecost, tongues of fire resting on the disciples, capturing a moment of divine outpouring.

---

Slide 20 Progressive Disclosure:
*   The promise was for "afterward" (Joel)
*   Peter identified this as the "last days" (Acts)
*   The gifts extend to sons, daughters, old, and young.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an elderly man sharing a dream with a young listener, both illuminated by soft firelight.

---

Slide 21 Deeper Insight: Peter identifies the outpouring of the Spirit as a defining characteristic of the "last days." God intends for His church to be guided by the Spirit of Prophecy until the very end of time.

[SN] Ephesians 4:8-11 lists apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers as gifts given *after* Christ’s ascension. These are spiritual endowments for the "perfecting of the saints."

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd guiding a flock, symbolizing the guidance provided to the church through spiritual gifts.

---

Slide 22 Question: Why did Jesus tell His disciples to wait before starting their mission?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the disciples gathered in the Upper Room, waiting in prayerful anticipation.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “...but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.” (Luke 24:49)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jerusalem at sunrise, the city quiet before the waking of the day.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: The disciples had the message (the Gospel), but they needed the power (the Spirit). Mission without the Spirit is ineffective.

[ILL] You can have a car with a perfect destination programmed into the GPS, but without fuel in the tank, it isn't going anywhere. The Spirit is the power that drives the mission of the church.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an unlit oil lamp sitting next to a jar of oil, symbolizing the potential for light that requires fuel.

---

Slide 25 Practical Application: The Holy Spirit desires to do three things in your life today:
1.  **Convict:** Show you where you need Jesus.
2.  **Comfort:** Stay by your side as a constant companion.
3.  **Empower:** Give you the strength to obey the truth.

Are you willing to "tarry" in prayer today to receive this power?
