Study Title: The Sabbath: Memorial of Creation and Redemption

Question: How does Scripture distinguish the true God from all false gods?

Biblical Answer: “The Lord is the true God, He is the living God, and an everlasting king... The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish... He hath made the earth by His power, He hath established the world by His wisdom.” (Jeremiah 10:10-12)

Explanation: The primary distinction of the true God is His power to create. While false gods are the works of men's hands or imaginations, the Living God is the Architect of reality itself. The apostles Paul and Barnabas used this same logic when speaking to idol worshipers, calling them to turn to the God "which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein" (Acts 14:15).

[DYK] In the ancient world, every nation had its own deities. The God of Israel claimed supremacy not merely as a tribal protector, but as the physical Originator of the universe.

Question: What specific reason does the Fourth Commandment give for keeping the Sabbath holy?

Biblical Answer: “For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day.” (Exodus 20:11)

Explanation: The Sabbath is the great memorial of creative power. God designed the Sabbath so that humanity would have a weekly reminder of their origins. Just as we celebrate birthdays to remember our beginning, the Sabbath celebrates the beginning of the world.

[ILL] If you build a magnificent house, you might place a cornerstone with the date and the builder's name. The Sabbath is God’s "cornerstone" in time—a permanent marker that identifies who built the world and when.

Question: Beyond remembering Creation, what does the Sabbath signify about our relationship with God?

Biblical Answer: “Verily My Sabbaths ye shall keep; for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you.” (Exodus 31:13; see also Ezekiel 20:20)

Explanation: The Sabbath is a "sign." It indicates that a person worships the true Creator. Furthermore, it is a sign of *sanctification*—the process by which God makes us holy. By setting aside a day that God has made holy, we acknowledge that we are His people, set apart from the world.

Term Definition: "Sanctify" comes from a root meaning "to cut" or "to separate." It means to set something apart for a holy use. God sanctified the seventh day (set it apart), and He sanctifies the people who keep it.

Question: In the book of Deuteronomy, what additional reason is given for Sabbath observance?

Biblical Answer: “And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand... therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day.” (Deuteronomy 5:15)

Explanation: Here, the motivation shifts from Creation to *Redemption*. The Israelites were slaves who had no rest; God delivered them into freedom.
The Sabbath is a weekly celebration of freedom.
• For Israel: Freedom from Pharaoh.
• For the Christian: Freedom from the slavery of sin.

Deeper Insight: Egyptian bondage illustrates the bondage of sin. Just as the Israelites could not keep God’s law perfectly while under the whip of Pharaoh, we cannot serve God while enslaved by sin. The Sabbath reminds us that God is the Deliverer who breaks our chains.

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangent: Note the beautiful harmony between the two versions of the Commandment. Exodus 20 points to the *power* of God (Creation). Deuteronomy 5 points to the *love* of God (Redemption). We worship Him because He made us, and because He saved us. This foreshadows the song of the redeemed in Revelation 15:3, celebrating both the "works" (Creation) and the "ways" (Salvation) of the Lord.

Question: What was God’s original plan for how the Sabbath should be used?

Biblical Answer: “Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation.” (Leviticus 23:3)

Explanation: The word "Sabbath" literally means *Rest*. However, this is not merely physical sleep or idleness. The text calls it a "holy convocation," which means an assembly or gathering of people.
God’s intent was for the day to be used for:
1.  Physical refreshment (Exodus 23:12)
2.  Contemplation of the Creator
3.  Public worship and fellowship

[ILL] Think of a battery charger. If you use a device constantly without recharging, it dies. The Sabbath is the spiritual charging station designed by the Manufacturer of humanity to restore our souls through connection with Him.

Practical Application: In a fast-paced world that often forgets God, the Sabbath offers a sanctuary in time. By keeping it, we protest against atheism (by acknowledging the Creator) and against salvation by works (by resting in His finished work of redemption).
