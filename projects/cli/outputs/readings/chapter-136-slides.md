Study Title: Diligence: The Pathway to Peace and Prosperity

---

Slide 1 Question: What tangible benefits does the Bible promise to those who are faithful and energetic in their work?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: 
“He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread.” (Prov. 28:19)
“The hand of the diligent maketh rich.” (Prov. 10:4)
“The soul of the diligent shall be made fat.” (Prov. 13:4)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Scripture presents work not as a curse, but as the God-ordained method for sustaining life. The "tilling of land" represents active engagement with our responsibilities. The promise is that effort leads to provision.

---

Slide 4 Term Definition: “Fat” in the context of Proverbs 13:4 does not refer to physical weight. It refers to a state of prosperity, abundance, and deep satisfaction. It is the spiritual and emotional opposite of a "lean" or starving soul.

---

Slide 5 Did You Know? [DYK]: In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, survival depended directly on daily physical labor. There were no safety nets; if you did not plant and harvest, you did not eat. This created a culture that viewed idleness as a direct threat to life.

Slide 6 Question: Conversely, what are the consequences of dealing with life using a "slack hand"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a neglected tool lying in the dust, perhaps a rusted sickle, symbolizing disuse.

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: 
“He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand.” (Prov. 10:4)
“The soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing.” (Prov. 13:4)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man sitting idly in the shade while others work in the background, looking wistful and empty-handed.

---

Slide 8 Explanation: A "slack hand" describes negligence, laziness, or a lack of tension and focus. The sluggard lives in a state of perpetual desire—wanting the rewards of labor without paying the price of effort—resulting in emptiness.

---

Slide 9 Illustration [ILL]: Imagine an archer. To hit the target, they must pull the bowstring tight with tension and focus. A "slack" string has no power and cannot launch the arrow. Similarly, a life without the tension of discipline cannot reach its goals.

Slide 10 Question: How does diligence affect a person’s social standing and influence?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: 
“The hand of the diligent shall bear rule, but the slothful shall be under tribute.” (Prov. 12:24)
“See thou a man diligent in his business? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.” (Prov. 22:29)

Slide 12 Progressive Disclosure:
• Competence leads to influence
• Laziness leads to dependence
• Quality work is noticed by leadership

---

Slide 13 Spirit-Led Insight [SN]: This principle was exemplified by Daniel and Joseph. Both were captives in foreign lands, yet their exceptional diligence and "excellent spirit" raised them to the right hand of kings. Faithful work is a form of witness to the world.

Slide 14 Question: What happens to our physical surroundings when we neglect them?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient stone wall beginning to crumble, vines creeping over the stones.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: 
“By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.” (Eccl. 10:18)
“I went by the field of the slothful... and lo, it was all grown over with thorns... and the stone wall thereof was broken down.” (Prov. 24:30-31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a ruined vineyard, overgrown with briars and weeds, with a broken watchtower in the background.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The wise man observed that the natural state of a fallen world is entropy and decay. Without active maintenance ("diligence"), order turns to chaos. Thorns and broken walls are the natural result of doing nothing.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a close-up of thorns wrapping around a fallen stone, soft but somber lighting.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The "thorns" mentioned in Proverbs 24 harken back to Genesis 3, where the ground was cursed because of sin. Diligence is man’s way of fighting back against the curse, cultivating beauty and order in a fallen world.

Slide 18 Question: Is there a connection between our secular work and our spiritual life?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a carpenter planing wood, with a look of prayerful meditation on his face.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: 
“Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.” (Rom. 12:11)
“Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully.” (Jer. 48:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe writing on parchment with intense focus and reverence.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: The Apostle Paul links business diligence directly with spiritual fervor. The Christian cannot be lazy in their daily vocation and expect to be vibrant in their spiritual walk. God calls for our best in all things.

---

Slide 21 Historical Note [SN]: The early Adventists and Puritans held to the "Protestant Work Ethic"—the belief that secular work was a vocation (calling) from God. Doing one's trade well was an act of worship. Practical duties are the discipline God uses to fit us for higher responsibilities.

Slide 22 Question: How does the quality of diligence relate to our preparation for the Second Coming of Christ?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure standing on a hill at twilight, looking expectantly toward the horizon.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: 
“Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of Him in peace, without spot and blameless.” (2 Peter 3:14)
“Give diligence to make your calling and election sure...” (2 Peter 1:10)

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Waiting for Christ is not a passive activity; it is an active one. We are to be diligent in character building, ensuring that when He returns, we are found in peace.

---

Slide 25 Term Definition: “Election” refers to God’s choice of us. By "making it sure," Peter means we confirm God’s choice by living in a way that demonstrates the reality of our faith. Diligence reveals the genuineness of our transformation.

Slide 26 Practical Application: Where do we need to apply diligence today?
• In our careers: working with integrity.
• In our homes: maintaining order and peace.
• In our spiritual lives: consistently studying and praying.
• In our character: rooting out the "thorns" of sin.
