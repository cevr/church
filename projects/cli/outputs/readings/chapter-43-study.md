Study Title: Prophecy Unlocked: The Four Great Monarchies

Question: When did Daniel receive this vision, and what was the central imagery?

Biblical Answer: “In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream... Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.” (Daniel 7:1-3)

Explanation: This vision occurred toward the end of the Babylonian empire. God pulled back the curtain of history for Daniel, using symbols to describe the rise and fall of nations. Before we identify the beasts, we must understand the setting.

Term Definition: **"Winds"** in symbolic prophecy represent political commotion, war, strife, and the scattering of nations (Jeremiah 25:31-33). **"Sea" or "Waters"** represent multitudes of people, nations, and tongues (Revelation 17:15). Therefore, "winds striving on the sea" represents war and conquest among the populated nations of the earth.

[DYK] Belshazzar was the final king of Babylon. This vision was given to Daniel shortly before the famous "handwriting on the wall" event in Daniel chapter 5, meaning Daniel knew the empire was doomed before the palace banquet ever began.

Question: What do the four beasts represent?

Biblical Answer: “These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.” (Daniel 7:17)

Explanation: The Bible interprets itself. We do not need to guess; these beasts are four distinct universal empires that would rule consecutively.

[ILL] Today, we still use animals to represent nations in political cartoons—the American Eagle, the Russian Bear, or the British Lion. God used similar symbols 2,500 years ago to describe the nature of these kingdoms.

Question: How are the first three kingdoms described?

Biblical Answer: 
1. **The Lion:** “The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings...” (Daniel 7:4)
2. **The Bear:** “And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it...” (Daniel 7:5)
3. **The Leopard:** “...another, like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads...” (Daniel 7:6)

Explanation: 
*   **The Lion (Babylon):** The king of beasts with the wings of the king of birds. This corresponds to the Head of Gold in Daniel 2. The wings being plucked and a "man's heart" given indicates the empire losing its boldness and conquering spirit before its fall.
*   **The Bear (Medo-Persia):** Raised on one side because the Persians were stronger than the Medes. The three ribs represent the three powers it conquered to gain dominion: Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.
*   **The Leopard (Greece):** A leopard is naturally fast, but with four wings, it denotes supernatural speed. Alexander the Great conquered the known world in roughly a decade. The four heads represent the four generals who divided the empire after Alexander's death.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the specificity of prophecy. Babylon was known for its winged lions—archaeologists have excavated massive winged lion statues from the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh. God used symbols that the prophets and the people of that time would recognize.

Question: How is the fourth kingdom described, and what makes it unique?

Biblical Answer: “...behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces... and it had ten horns.” (Daniel 7:7)

Explanation: This represents the **Roman Empire**. It corresponds to the legs of iron in Daniel 2. It was ruthless ("dreadful and terrible"), crushing opposition with military might ("iron teeth"). Unlike the previous beasts, which were replaced by a single conqueror, this beast was not conquered by another; it evolved.

Question: What do the ten horns signify?

Biblical Answer: “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.” (Daniel 7:24)

Explanation: Rome was not conquered by a fifth universal empire; it broke apart into ten divisions (the ten horns). These correspond to the barbarian tribes that settled in Europe (Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Franks, Vandals, Suevi, Alamanni, Burgundians, Heruli, Lombards, and Anglo-Saxons).

Progressive Disclosure: 
*   **The Lion**: Babylon (605–539 B.C.)
*   **The Bear**: Medo-Persia (539–331 B.C.)
*   **The Leopard**: Greece (331–168 B.C.)
*   **The Fourth Beast**: Rome (168 B.C.–476 A.D.)
*   **The Ten Horns**: Divided Europe (476 A.D.–Present)

[SN] A note on Historicism: The pioneers of the Advent movement understood that prophecy is a continuous timeline. The mention of the "other" horn that rises *after* the ten is crucial. It points to a power that is "diverse" (different)—a religious-political power rising out of the ruins of the Roman Empire. This sets the stage for the judgment scene later in Daniel 7.

Practical Application: Why does this matter to us?
*   **God's Sovereignty:** History is not a random series of accidents; God foretold the rise and fall of nations centuries in advance.
*   **Trust:** If God accurately predicted the rise of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome, we can trust His promises regarding the final kingdom—the Kingdom of God—which will soon be established.
*   **Perspective:** Earthly kingdoms are beastly, predatory, and temporary. Our citizenship belongs to a Kingdom that shall not be destroyed.
