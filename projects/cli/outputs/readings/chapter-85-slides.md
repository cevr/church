Study Title: Shadows and Substance: Distinguishing the Sabbaths

---

Slide 1 Question: What does the Apostle Paul say was "blotted out" and "nailed to the cross"?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to His cross...” (Colossians 2:14)

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer (Continued): “...Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days, which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.” (Colossians 2:16-17)

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Paul speaks of a specific system of "ordinances" that served as shadows. A shadow is merely a silhouette cast by a solid object. In the plan of salvation, ceremonial days were shadows cast by the coming life and ministry of Jesus.

---

Slide 5 Illustration: Imagine waiting for a friend. You see their shadow around the corner first. You watch the shadow to know they are coming. But once your friend steps into view, you no longer look at the shadow—you embrace the friend.

[ILL] The ceremonial laws were the shadow; Christ is the friend. Once the "body" (Christ) arrived, the shadows were no longer necessary.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two friends embracing in a city street, with long shadows cast behind them on the cobblestones.

Slide 6 Question: Unlike the "handwriting of ordinances," how was the Moral Law (the Ten Commandments) recorded?

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “And He declared unto you His covenant, which He commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy 4:13)

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer (Continued): “And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.” (Exodus 32:16)

---

Slide 9 Explanation: Ceremonial ordinances were written by hand on parchment and could be blotted out with ink. The Ten Commandments were engraved by God into stone. Stone implies permanence; you cannot "blot out" engravings.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The distinction between "handwriting" (*cheirographon*) and "God's writing" is vital. The former implies a temporary legal bond or debt note; the latter implies the eternal character of the King.

Slide 10 Question: Was the weekly Sabbath part of the ordinances that were "against us"?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “And He said unto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking through a grain field with his disciples on a sunny day, looking benevolent and kind.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: Something created specifically *for* your benefit cannot be described as being *against* you. Jesus affirms that the Sabbath was a gift to humanity, not a burden to be removed.

Slide 13 Question: When was the weekly Sabbath established, and does this timing matter?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the earth seen from space, surrounded by the glory of creation and stars.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished... And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it He had rested from all His work... And God saw every thing that He had made, and behold, it was very good.” (Genesis 2:1-3; 1:31)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Garden of Eden, lush and perfect, with a golden light bathing the landscape in peace.

---

Slide 15 Progressive Disclosure:
1. **Timing**: Established at Creation.
2. **Condition**: Established before sin existed.
3. **Nature**: It was part of a "very good" world.

---

Slide 16 Deeper Insight: Ceremonial sabbaths were instituted *after* sin to point toward a Savior. The weekly Sabbath was instituted *before* sin as a celebration of Creation. Therefore, the weekly Sabbath is not a shadow of redemption; it is a memorial of creation.

---

Slide 17 Question: Does the Bible explicitly mention other "sabbaths" distinct from the weekly Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient Hebrew calendar or scroll marked with various feast days.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath... Also the tenth day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement... It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest.” (Leviticus 23:24, 27-32)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest standing before the curtain of the sanctuary, holding a censer of incense.

---

Slide 19 Term Definition: **Ceremonial Sabbaths**
These were specific annual dates (like the Day of Atonement) linked to the harvest cycle and sanctuary service. They could fall on any day of the week and involved sacrifices foreshadowing Jesus.

---

Slide 20 Question: Does Scripture distinguish these annual feast sabbaths from the weekly Seventh-day Sabbath?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a scribe looking closely at two different scrolls, comparing them.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “These are the feasts of the Lord... Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts...” (Leviticus 23:37-38)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a table with two distinct piles of scrolls, clearly separated from one another by a dividing line.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: The text draws a sharp line: "Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord." The annual ceremonial days were additions to the spiritual calendar, separate and distinct from the weekly Sabbath established in Eden.

[DYK] The phrase "Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord" indicates that the weekly Sabbath stands apart from the sacrificial system. Even when the sacrificial system (the shadow) met its fulfillment, the memorial of Creation remained.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Ark of the Covenant (containing the Law) standing apart from the Altar of Burnt Offering (representing sacrifice).

---

Slide 23 Practical Application:
*   **Trust the Substance**: We need not offer lambs; we have Jesus.
*   **Keep the Memorial**: We keep the weekly Sabbath to celebrate the Creator and the Redeemer.

---

Slide 24 Discernment: As students of the Word, we must rightly divide Scripture, distinguishing between the temporary laws of symbols (shadows) and the eternal law of love (substance).
