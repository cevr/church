Study Title: Creation and the Creator

Question: Who is the Creator, and how were the heavens and earth brought into existence?

Biblical Answer: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” (Genesis 1:1) ... “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made... For He spake, and it was done; He commanded, and it stood fast.” (Psalm 33:6-9)

Explanation: The Bible opens with the foundational truth that matter is not eternal; only God is eternal. He did not require pre-existing material to build the universe. He created by "fiat"—His spoken command implies omnipotent power.

[DYK] The phrase "He spake, and it was done" suggests immediacy. Unlike human manufacturing which requires time and effort, God’s will is instantly translated into reality through His Word.

Question: Through whom did the Father perform this work of creation?

Biblical Answer: “For by Him [the Son] were all things created... visible and invisible... all things were created by Him, and for Him.” (Colossians 1:16); “All things were made by Him; and without Him was not any thing made that was made.” (John 1:3)

Explanation: The New Testament reveals that Jesus Christ (the Word) was the active agent in Creation. The Father and the Son were united in the work of bringing the universe into existence.

Term Definition: “Visible and invisible” encompasses the physical universe (stars, planets, nature) and the spiritual realm (angels, authorities, and powers). Christ is sovereign over both.

Question: How does the Bible describe the creation of humanity?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7)

Progressive Disclosure:
• **Formation**: God used physical matter ("dust") to shape the body.
• **Animation**: God added the "breath of life" (spirit).
• **Result**: Man *became* a living soul (a living person).

[ILL] Consider a light bulb. You have the glass bulb (the body) and the electricity (the breath/spirit). When you put them together, you get light (the living soul). If you remove the electricity, the light ceases to exist. Similarly, the "soul" is the combination of body and breath, not a separate entity that exists outside the body.

Question: In whose image was humanity made, and what was their original station?

Biblical Answer: “So God created man in His own image... male and female created He them.” (Genesis 1:27); “Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet.” (Psalm 8:6)

Explanation: Unlike the animals, humanity possesses the "image of God." This includes the ability to reason, the capacity for moral judgment, and the authority to govern the earth as God's stewards.

Question: What sustains the universe and keeps it from falling into chaos?

Biblical Answer: “Upholding all things by the word of His power.” (Hebrews 1:3)

Deeper Insight: Creation was not a one-time act of winding up a clock and walking away (Deism). The same "Word" that spoke the worlds into existence is required every moment to keep the atoms holding together and the planets in orbit.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion:
• The link between the Creator and the Sabbath (Exodus 20:8-11), identifying the "Lord our Maker" (Psalm 95:6).
• The parallel between the "breath of life" in Genesis and the Holy Spirit ("breath") in the New Birth (John 3).
• The connection between Christ as Creator and Christ as Redeemer—only the One who created us has the power to re-create us.

Question: Why are we called to worship God, and what distinguishes Him from false gods?

Biblical Answer: “O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the Lord our Maker.” (Psalm 95:6); “The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish...” (Jeremiah 10:11)

Explanation: Worship is due to God specifically because He is the Source of life. Any being or object that did not create the heavens and earth is a false god and unworthy of worship.

Question: Is God’s creative work finished, or is He working on something new in us?

Biblical Answer: “For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works...” (Ephesians 2:10); “For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth...” (Isaiah 65:17)

Explanation: While the physical creation was finished in Genesis, God is currently engaged in a spiritual creation—restoring His image in the hearts of believers. This work prepares us for the ultimate promise: a physically restored New Earth.

Practical Application:
• **Stewardship**: Since God created the earth, we should care for it.
• **Unity**: “Have we not all one Father? hath not one God created us?” (Malachi 2:10). Racism and prejudice are sins against the Creator.
• **Trust**: If God can speak the universe into existence and uphold it, He can uphold you in your daily trials.
