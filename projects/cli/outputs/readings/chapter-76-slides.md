Study Title: The Two Covenants: Promises of Man vs. Promises of God

---

Slide 1 Question: When God approached Israel at Sinai, what proposal did He make to them?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people...” (Exodus 19:5)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: God offered a special relationship based on mutual agreement. If the people obeyed, they would be His "peculiar treasure."

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "peculiar treasure" is *segullah*, referring to a king’s private wealth or personal jewel, separate from the public treasury. God wanted a personal, intimate connection with His people.

Slide 4 Question: How did the people respond to God’s proposal?

Slide 5 Biblical Answer: “And all the people answered together, and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do.” (Exodus 19:8)

---

Slide 6 Explanation: The people immediately pledged full obedience. This agreement—God’s law and the people’s promise to keep it in their own strength—constituted the "Old Covenant."

Slide 7 Question: What specific standard was the core of this covenant?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two rough-hewn stone tablets resting on a rock, waiting to be engraved.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.” (Deuteronomy 4:13)

---

Slide 9 Term Definition: "Covenant" means a binding contract or agreement between two parties. Here, the Ten Commandments formed the basis of the agreement.

Slide 10 Question: Why was a "New Covenant" necessary? Was there a flaw in the law?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man looking down at a broken stone, his posture one of sorrow and inability.

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second... But now hath He obtained a more excellent ministry... established upon better promises.” (Hebrews 8:7, 6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a ray of bright, golden light breaking through dark storm clouds, symbolizing a better hope.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The text says the "first covenant" was not faultless. The fault was not with God's law (which is holy), but with the "promises." The Old Covenant relied on the people's promise ("We will do"), which they ultimately broke.

Slide 13 Illustration: The Child and the Boulder

[ILL] Imagine a child trying to lift a heavy boulder to please their father. The child promises, "I will lift it," but lacks the strength. The failure isn't the father's fault for asking, nor the boulder's fault for being heavy; the failure lies in the child's reliance on their own limited strength.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small child straining to lift a large heavy rock while a father figure watches with compassionate understanding.

---

Slide 14 Question: What are the "better promises" of the New Covenant?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove descending with soft light, symbolizing a divine gift coming from above.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “For this is the covenant that I will make... I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.” (Hebrews 8:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a human figure with a glowing warm light emanating from within their chest, representing the law written on the heart.

---

Slide 16 Progressive Disclosure:
• **Old Covenant:** "We will do" (Relies on Human effort)
• **New Covenant:** "I [God] will do" (Relies on Divine power)

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: The Law does not change; its *location* changes.
*   Old Covenant: Tables of stone (external rule).
*   New Covenant: The heart (internal desire).

Slide 18 Insight: The Timeline of Faith

[SN] Optional Spirit-led tangent: The "New" Covenant is actually older than the "Old." The promise of salvation through faith was given to Adam and Abraham long before Sinai. Sinai was introduced to show the people their sinfulness and need for a Savior (Galatians 3:19).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham looking up at the starry night sky, receiving the promise of faith.

---

Slide 19 Question: How is the New Covenant ratified (made legally valid)?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient legal decree being stamped with a royal signet ring.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And for this cause he [Christ] is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death... they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.” (Hebrews 9:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, portrayed with reverence and soft dramatic lighting, symbolizing the ratification by death.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: A testament (will/covenant) requires a death to be in force. The Old Covenant was ratified with the blood of animals, which could not take away sin. The New Covenant is ratified by the blood of Jesus Christ.

Slide 22 Question: If we cannot earn salvation by our works, does that mean we do not obey?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a traveler standing at a fork in the road, looking for the right path.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “I will put My spirit within you, and cause you to walk in My statutes, and ye shall keep My judgments, and do them.” (Ezekiel 36:27)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd gently guiding a sheep with his staff, the sheep following naturally.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Under the New Covenant, obedience is the *result* of salvation, not the cause. God's Spirit enters the heart and empowers the believer to live a life that pleases God.

[ILL] A manual transmission car requires the driver to constantly work the gears. An automatic car shifts because of the mechanism inside it. The New Covenant is like having a new engine installed—the Holy Spirit—that drives us toward righteousness naturally.

---

Slide 25 Question: How do we enter into this New Covenant relationship today?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling in a garden, hands clasped in earnest prayer.

---

Slide 26 Biblical Answer: “Submit yourselves therefore to God... Yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.” (James 4:7; Romans 6:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person standing with arms open wide, surrendering to a glorious light breaking from the heavens.

---

Slide 27 Practical Application: To live in the New Covenant:
• Stop relying on promises to "be good."
• Admit inability to keep the law in your own strength.
• Submit to Christ; let Him write His law of love in your heart.
• Trust His blood for the past and His Spirit for the future.
