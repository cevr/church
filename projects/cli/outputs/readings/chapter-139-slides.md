---

Slide 1 Question: What promise does Jesus give to those who bring their needs to God?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Everyone that asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.” (Matthew 7:8)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: This threefold promise—asking, seeking, knocking—implies an active, deepening relationship. God does not hide Himself from us; He invites us to pursue Him.

Slide 4 Illustration: Think of a child asking a parent for food.

“If ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him?” (Matthew 7:11)

[ILL] If imperfect humans love to give, the Perfect Father loves to give infinitely more.

Slide 5 Question: In whose authority should we present our requests?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” (John 14:13)

Slide 7 Explanation: Praying "in Jesus' name" is not merely a closing phrase. It means praying in His authority and in accordance with His character. We approach the Father not based on our own merit, but through the merit of Christ.

[SN] The "Name" in Hebrew thought represents character and authority. To ask in His name is to ask for things that align with His will and nature. It is similar to a power of attorney—we are authorized to do business with heaven on Christ's behalf.

Slide 8 Question: What are the essential conditions for acceptable prayer?

Slide 9 Condition 1: Faith

Biblical Answer: “But without faith it is impossible to please Him... he that cometh to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.” (Hebrews 11:6)

Slide 10 Condition 2: Forgiveness

Biblical Answer: “And when ye stand praying, forgive if ye have aught against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” (Mark 11:25)

Deeper Insight: There is a direct link between our vertical relationship with God and our horizontal relationship with others. If we hold onto bitterness, we block the channel of God's grace.

Slide 11 Condition 3: Sincerity

Biblical Answer: “Use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do...” (Matthew 6:7)

Term Definition: "Vain repetitions" refers to mechanical chanting or memorized phrases spoken without the engagement of the mind or heart. God desires a relationship, not a ritual.

Slide 12 Question: Where and how often should we pray?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a quiet window overlooking an ancient city at twilight, soft light, historically respectful.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: Secretly

“Enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret...” (Matthew 6:6)

[DYK] The term "closet" in the KJV refers to a private room or inner chamber—a storehouse where one could lock the door. In the busy, communal living of the first century, finding a solitary place required intentional effort.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: Constantly

“Pray without ceasing.” (1 Thessalonians 5:17)

Examples of Prayer:
*   **Jesus:** Retired to mountains to be alone (Matt 14:23).
*   **Daniel:** Prayed three times a day in his house (Dan 6:10).
*   **Early Church:** Prayed together in groups (Acts 12:12).

Slide 15 Question: Why is persistence in prayer necessary, especially in the last days?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a watchman on a city wall at night, holding a lantern and looking out into the darkness.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Men ought always to pray and not to faint... Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.” (Luke 18:1, 21:36)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a widow pleading her case before a judge, soft light, historically respectful, portraying persistence.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: Jesus used the parable of the persistent widow to teach us not to give up. As we approach the end of time, spiritual drowsiness is a danger. Prayer is the method by which we stay "awake" and connected to God's strength.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Notice the connection between prayer and prophecy in Luke 21. The ability to "stand" before the Son of Man—judgment terminology—is linked directly to a life of watching and praying.

Slide 18 Practical Application: How can we apply these principles today?

1.  **Set a time:** Like Daniel, have specific times for appointment with God.
2.  **Check your heart:** Ask God to reveal any unforgiveness you are holding.

Slide 19 Practical Application: Continued

3.  **Be specific:** Do not use generic phrases; "ask, seek, and knock" for specific needs.
4.  **Give thanks:** Mingle every request with thanksgiving to combat anxiety (Phil 4:6).
