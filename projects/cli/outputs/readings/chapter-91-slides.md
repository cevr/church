---

Slide 1 Question: Against what terrible danger does the Bible give its most solemn warning?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an angel holding a scroll and a trumpet, surrounded by a divine glow, hovering over a dark landscape.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The third angel’s message warns against false worship. It highlights a coming conflict where humanity divides into two groups: those loyal to God and those loyal to a human-devised system of authority (the "beast").

---

Slide 4 Insight: Symbolism of Forehead and Hand

[DYK] In prophecy, the "forehead" represents the mind, intellect, and settled decisions. The "hand" represents actions, labor, or going along with the crowd for convenience.

Slide 5 Question: What characterizes the group that refuses the mark of the beast?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of saints looking upward with expressions of endurance and hope, bathed in a beam of heavenly light.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: There is a direct contrast here. Those with the "mark" follow the beast; the "saints" follow God by keeping His commandments. This reveals that the "mark" involves a specific violation of God’s law.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Uniform of Loyalty

[ILL] Imagine a soldier on a battlefield. His uniform tells you which general he serves. In the final spiritual conflict, obedience to God’s specific commandments is the "uniform" that distinguishes the loyal soldier from the rebel.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Roman soldier in full armor standing guard, his breastplate reflecting the light, symbolizing loyalty and identity.

---

Slide 9 Question: Which commandment is the specific point of contention regarding the beast's authority?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient scroll open to the writings of Exodus, soft light focusing on the text.

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.” (Exodus 20:10) ... “The Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus walking peacefully through a grain field on the Sabbath, with disciples nearby, soft golden hour sunlight.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The "mark" is a sign of authority opposing God's sign. God’s sign of authority is the Sabbath, identifying Him as Creator. The "beast" power claims authority by changing the day of worship from the seventh day (Saturday) to the first day (Sunday).

Slide 12 Term Definition: Apostasy

**Apostasy** means a falling away or a defection from the truth. The "Mark of Apostasy" is the acceptance of a human institution (Sunday) over a divine institution (Sabbath).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a path that splits in two directions; one narrow and straight, the other wide and turning away, symbolizing departure from truth.

---

Slide 13 Historical Context

[DYK] Many Protestant scholars and catechisms admit that the change from Sabbath to Sunday rests not on Scripture, but solely on the authority of the church. As one Catholic catechism states, it is the "mark" of their power to ordain feasts.

---

Slide 14 Question: How will this mark eventually be enforced upon the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a busy ancient marketplace, merchants trading wares, with a sense of tension in the atmosphere.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And he [the two-horned beast] causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark... that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark.” (Revelation 13:16-17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a merchant turning a customer away, a look of sadness and restriction on their faces.

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The enforcement is economic and legislative. While God draws men by love, this false system forces compliance through boycotts ("cannot buy or sell") and eventual death decrees.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a royal decree being nailed to a wooden post, a crowd gathering to read it with concern.

---

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: Church and State

The prophecy identifies a second power (the "two-horned beast") that exercises influence to enforce homage to the first beast. This indicates a union of church and state to enforce religious observance.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two symbolic figures, one representing civil power and the other religious power, standing together in agreement.

---

Slide 18 Speaker Note: The Victory

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The "Sea of Glass" in Revelation 15:2 is where the victors stand. In the ancient sanctuary service, the "sea" was the laver for washing. Here, it is mingled with fire, symbolizing that these believers have passed through the fiery trial of the last days and come out purified.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sea that looks like glass mingled with fire, glowing with ethereal light, majestic and calm.

---

Slide 19 Question: What major event follows the warning against the mark of the beast?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure looking up at the sky, shielding their eyes, as clouds begin to roll back.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man... And He that sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped.” (Revelation 14:14, 16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ seated on a radiant white cloud, wearing a golden crown and holding a sharp sickle.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: The enforcement of the mark is the final test before the harvest of the earth—the Second Coming of Jesus. The warning is given urgently because the end of the world follows immediately after this decision.

Slide 22 Practical Application: How do we prepare?

• Cultivate the "patience of the saints" (endurance) today in small trials.
• Commit to following Scripture even when it contradicts tradition.
• Rest in the "faith of Jesus," trusting the Lord of the Sabbath to protect His people.
