Slide 6 Term Definition:
**Filthiness of the Flesh:** Physical habits and practices that defile the body.
**Filthiness of the Spirit:** Impurities of the mind and heart.

True holiness requires the purification of both.

Slide 7 Question: Why does God take the condition of our physical bodies so seriously?

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.” (1 Corinthians 3:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a believer in deep prayer, their body illuminated as if an inner light is glowing, representing the indwelling Spirit.

Slide 9 Explanation: The believer’s body is not their own property to abuse; it is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit. Introducing harmful substances into the body is an act of defiling God's sanctuary.

Slide 10 Illustration: The Living Sanctuary
Imagine a beautiful church dedicated to worship. If someone were to smear filth on the walls or damage the foundation, it would be an insult to the owner. Similarly, our bodies are living sanctuaries; damaging them with poisons insults our Creator.

Slide 11 Question: What specific substances are identified as defiling or poisonous to the body?

Slide 13 Deeper Insight: The "Unclean Thing"
While the Bible sets the principle of separation, science confirms the physical poison.
*   **Tobacco:** Contains nicotine, a deadly poison.
*   **Stimulants:** Tea and coffee contain theine and tannin, classified as violent poisons to the system.

[DYK] When Columbus discovered Cuba in 1492, his sailors reported seeing natives carrying "firebrands" and puffing smoke, which the sailors thought was a way of perfuming themselves. This "savage" custom of smoking eventually spread to Europe and became a global form of intoxication.

Slide 14 Progressive Disclosure: The Dangers
*   **Tobacco:** Nicotine affects the blood, heart, eyes, and brain.
*   **Tea & Coffee:** Theine (similar to strychnine) and tannin paralyze digestion and cause nervousness, peevishness, and "chronic derangement."

Slide 15 Question: How should a Christian relate to the habits of the world around them?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bustling ancient city street filled with revelry, with one figure walking calmly in the opposite direction.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.” (1 Peter 4:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient Roman banquet scene, depicted with a sense of chaos and excess, contrasted by a calm observer in the foreground.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: The "will of the Gentiles" (the ungodly) is characterized by satisfying the lusts of the flesh. A Christian is called to leave these former habits behind and live according to the will of God.

[SN] Spirit-Led Insight: The Greek concept of "sorcery" (pharmakeia) in the New Testament is often linked to the use of drugs or potions. While not explicitly used in this text, the principle aligns: God's people are to be free from chemical dependency and artificial stimulation, relying instead on the Holy Spirit.

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “And every man that hath this hope in Him, purifieth himself even as He is pure.” (1 John 3:3)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ standing in radiant white light, His expression one of perfect purity and welcome.

Slide 20 Explanation: The hope of the Second Coming and seeing Jesus "as He is" drives the believer to prepare. To live in a perfect, pure eternity, we begin the work of purification now.

Slide 23 Practical Application
To glorify God in our body and spirit requires action:
*   Acknowledge we are "bought with a price."
*   Abstain from stimulants and narcotics (tobacco, tea, coffee).
*   Be "separate" from destructive worldly customs.

[ILL] Total abstinence is the only safe path. Just as one would not take "moderate" doses of a known poison like arsenic, the Christian "temple-keeper" avoids all habits that degrade the body's delicate machinery.
