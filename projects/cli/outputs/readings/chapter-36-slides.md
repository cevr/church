[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This phenomenon is known medically as *hematidrosis*. It occurs only under extreme degrees of stress. It signifies that the shedding of blood for our atonement began not on the cross, but in the garden, as Jesus mentally accepted the "cup" of God's wrath against sin.

Slide 19 Explanation: The creatures mocked the Creator. They used symbols of royalty (a crown, a scepter, a robe) to humiliate Him, unaware that He was indeed the King of the Universe submitting to this shame for their sakes.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting focusing on the crown of thorns resting on a stone floor, contrasting sharp spikes with soft lighting.
