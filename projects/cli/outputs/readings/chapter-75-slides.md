Study Title: Not Justified by the Law

---

Slide 1 Question: Can performing good deeds or keeping the commandments make a person righteous before God?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in His sight.” (Romans 3:20)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Bible is clear that human effort cannot bridge the gap caused by sin. No matter how hard we try to follow rules, “deeds of the law” cannot erase our past guilt or transform the heart on their own. The law was not designed to be a savior.

---

Slide 4 Term Definition: “Justified” is a legal term. It means to be declared innocent or righteous in a court of law. The text says our own actions cannot earn this verdict.

Slide 5 Illustration: Imagine a mirror. If your face is dirty, the mirror faithfully reveals the dirt, but you cannot use the mirror to wash your face. In the same way, the law reveals our sin, but it cannot cleanse us.

Slide 6 Question: If the law cannot save us, what is its purpose?

---

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “I had not known sin, but by the law; for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.” (Romans 7:7); “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” (Romans 3:20)

---

Slide 8 Explanation: The law functions as a diagnostic tool. It identifies what sin is. Without a standard, we would not realize we have strayed from God’s character.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a physician examining a patient, holding a tool to check their eyes, focused and serious.

---

Slide 9 Did You Know: Paul specifically quotes the tenth commandment (“Thou shalt not covet”). While other commandments deal with outward actions, coveting deals with the thoughts of the heart. This shows the law reaches deep into our internal motives.

---

Slide 10 Question: Does this standard apply only to the Jewish people, or to everyone?

---

Slide 11 Biblical Answer: “Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.” (Romans 3:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a multitude of people standing silent and humbled before a great, glowing throne.

---

Slide 12 Explanation: The law applies to the whole world. The phrase “every mouth may be stopped” suggests a courtroom scene where the defendant has no excuses left. All humanity is accountable to the Creator.

---

Slide 13 Question: Since the law points out our guilt, is the law itself bad or flawed?

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.” (Romans 7:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Tablets of Stone glowing with a pure, white ethereal light, signifying holiness.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: The problem is not with the law; the problem is with us. The law is a transcript of God’s character—holy and good. A standard that points out error is necessary, even if it makes us feel uncomfortable.

[SN] Tangent on the Harmony of Law and Gospel: Early Adventists emphasized that the Law and the Gospel are not enemies. The Law drives us to Christ (because we see our need), and Christ points us back to the Law (empowering us to live it out in love).

---

Slide 16 Question: If the law condemns us, how then can we be saved?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person kneeling on the ground, looking up with hands clasped in supplication.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 3:24)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus reaching down to lift a kneeling person, bathed in warm, golden light.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: This is the heart of the Gospel. We are declared innocent (justified) not by working, but “freely by His grace.” It is a gift made possible because Jesus paid the price (redemption).

---

Slide 19 Term Definitions:
**Grace:** Unmerited favor—receiving what we do not deserve.
**Redemption:** To buy back, often referring to buying a slave’s freedom.

---

Slide 20 Question: Does receiving this free grace give us a license to disobey God?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two paths diverging in a wood, one leading to light, one to shadow.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey...” (Romans 6:15-16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a servant bowing respectfully and joyfully before a kind and noble King.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: Absolutely not. Being saved by grace changes who our Master is. We are no longer slaves to sin; we become servants of righteousness. Grace leads to a life of willing obedience, not rebellion.

[ILL] If a judge pardons a criminal, the criminal does not say, "Thank you, now I can go break the law again." The pardon is granted with the expectation of a changed life.

---

Slide 23 Question: How do we live a life free from condemnation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person walking through a field of wheat, looking peaceful and unburdened.

---

Slide 24 Biblical Answer: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” (Romans 8:1)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dove descending gently toward a believer, soft rays of light surrounding them.

---

Slide 25 Progressive Disclosure:
*   Security is found "in Christ"
*   The evidence of this security is a walk led by the Spirit
*   The condemnation of the law is removed

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd leading a sheep along a safe path beside still waters.

---

Slide 26 Deeper Insight: The Christian walk is described as walking “after the Spirit.” We do not keep the law to *get* saved; we keep it because we *are* saved and the Spirit is writing God's law in our hearts (Hebrews 8:10).

Slide 27 Practical Application: How do we balance Law and Grace today?
*   We stop trying to earn heaven by good behavior
*   We allow the Bible to reveal our sins so we can confess them
*   We accept Jesus' forgiveness immediately
*   We ask the Holy Spirit to empower us to obey out of love.
