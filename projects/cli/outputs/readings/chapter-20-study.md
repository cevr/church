Study Title: Baptism: Buried to Live

Question: What commission did Jesus give to His disciples regarding new believers?

Biblical Answer: “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.” (Matthew 28:19)

Explanation: The instruction is clear: first comes teaching (making disciples), then comes baptism. It is a public entry into the family of God, authorized by the full authority of the Godhead.

[DYK] The Greek word for "baptize" is *baptizo*, which literally means "to dip," "to plunge," or "to immerse." In secular Greek of the time, it was used to describe sinking a ship or dyeing cloth by dipping it completely into dye.

Question: What spiritual preparation is necessary before a person is baptized?

Biblical Answer: “Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized everyone of you... Repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Acts 2:38; Acts 20:21)

Explanation: Baptism is an outward expression of an inward change. Two things are required: repentance (turning away from sin) and faith (turning toward Jesus). Because all have sinned (Romans 3:23), the law convinces us of our need for a Savior. We must realize our condition before we can accept the remedy.

Question: Why is baptism described as a burial?

Biblical Answer: “Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we should walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4)

Explanation: This is the heart of the doctrine. Baptism is a memorial of Christ’s death and resurrection. The candidate goes under the water (death/burial of the old life of sin) and rises out of the water (resurrection to a new life in Christ).

[ILL] Consider a funeral. We do not bury people by sprinkling a handful of dirt on their shoulder; we bury them completely in the earth. Similarly, to symbolize the death of the "old man of sin," the believer is completely buried in the water.

Term Definition: "Old Man" (Romans 6:6) refers to our former self—the nature controlled by sinful desires and selfishness. This "old man" is crucified with Christ so we are no longer slaves to sin.

Question: Does the Bible specify the mode (method) of baptism?

Biblical Answer: “And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.” (Acts 8:38)

Explanation: Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch went *down into* the water. If baptism were merely sprinkling or pouring, they could have used water from a container. The physical action of going into the water aligns with the spiritual symbolism of burial.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Apostle Paul asserts there is “One Lord, one faith, one baptism” (Ephesians 4:5). While traditions have changed over centuries, the Bible presents a single, unified method. Even scholars from denominations that practice sprinkling (like Conybeare and Howson of the Church of England) have admitted that the primitive church practiced immersion.

Question: Can infants or those too young to understand the gospel be scripturally baptized?

Biblical Answer: “He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved...” (Mark 16:16). “And they spake unto him the word of the Lord... and he... rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.” (Acts 16:32, 34)

Explanation: Belief is a prerequisite for baptism. In the case of the Philippian jailer (Acts 16), the entire household was baptized only after the entire household had the Word preached to them and *believed*. One must be old enough to understand sin, repentance, and faith to truly "put on Christ" (Galatians 3:27).

Question: After baptism, how should the believer live?

Biblical Answer: “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.” (Colossians 3:1)

Explanation: Emerging from the water is the beginning, not the end. It marks the start of a new life where our affections are set on heavenly things. We walk in "newness of life," empowered by the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead.

Deeper Insight: Baptism is the public "marriage ceremony" to Christ. Just as a wedding ceremony doesn't make two people love each other (that happens first), baptism doesn't magically create faith; it publicly declares a union that has already taken place in the heart.

Practical Application: Have you experienced the death of the "old man"? If you have repented and accepted Jesus, baptism is your privilege and duty—a public testimony that you now belong to the King.
