Study Title: The Judgment: Fairness, Records, and Hope

Question: Who must face the test of the judgment?

Biblical Answer: “I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked.” (Ecclesiastes 3:17)

Explanation: The judgment is universal. It includes the entire human family, regardless of status or belief. The text indicates that God does not overlook anyone; every life comes under review to set the universe right.

[DYK] The judgment is not limited to humanity. The Bible indicates that fallen angels are also "reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day" (Jude 6). This confirms that God’s government is dealing with the entire cosmic rebellion, not just human sin.

Question: Where does the judgment begin?

Biblical Answer: “For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God...” (1 Peter 4:17)

Explanation: Logic dictates that before rewards are handed out, the winners must be identified. Therefore, the judgment begins with those who profess to serve God ("the house of God") to determine who is truly His before the final rewards are given.

Question: What evidence is used in this court?

Biblical Answer: “The judgment was set, and the books were opened.” (Daniel 7:10)

Explanation: God’s judgment is not arbitrary; it is based on a recorded history. The "books" represent an exact transcript of decisions, words, and deeds.

Term Definition: "Books of Remembrance" (Malachi 3:16) contain the record of good deeds and those who thought upon God's name. The "Book of Life" (Revelation 3:5) contains the names of those professed to be God's children.

[ILL] Imagine a court case where the judge has a perfect video recording and transcript of every event in question. There can be no mistake in the verdict because the evidence is complete and undeniable.

Question: Does this judgment happen before or after the Second Coming of Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead...” (Luke 20:35)

Explanation: Notice the phrase "accounted worthy." To be found worthy to rise in the "resurrection of life" (John 5:29) when Jesus returns, a decision must have been made *before* He arrives. This phase is often called the "Investigative Judgment." It determines who will be translated or resurrected when the trumpet sounds.

Deeper Insight: When Christ returns, His reward is *with* Him (Revelation 22:12). He does not come to investigate, but to execute the decision already made in the courts of heaven.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The prophecy of Daniel 7 describes the "Ancient of Days" sitting and the books opening *before* the Son of Man receives His kingdom. This aligns with the Pioneer understanding of the cleansing of the sanctuary—a work done by the High Priest prior to leaving the sanctuary to bless the waiting people.

Question: Who defends the believer during this judgment?

Biblical Answer: “He that overcometh... I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and before His angels.” (Revelation 3:5)

Explanation: We do not stand alone. Jesus acts as our Advocate. If we have confessed our sins and remained loyal to Him, He covers our imperfect lives with His perfect righteousness. He presents His blood as the reason we can be saved.

[ILL] If you were on trial for a capital crime, your only hope would be a defense attorney who not only knows the law perfectly but has also paid the penalty for you. Jesus is that Attorney.

Question: What role do the saved play in the judgment of the wicked?

Biblical Answer: “Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?... Know ye not that we shall judge angels?” (1 Corinthians 6:2-3)

Explanation: After the Second Coming, during the thousand years (Revelation 20:4), the saved participate in a review of the cases of the lost (including fallen angels). God allows the redeemed to see the records, ensuring that everyone understands that God’s decisions were just and necessary. This is the "Executive" phase preparation.

Progressive Disclosure: • God investigates (Pre-Advent) • Christ rescues (Second Advent) • Saints review (Millennium) • Final justice is executed (Post-Millennium)

Practical Application: How should we live in light of the judgment?
• With seriousness: “God shall bring every work into judgment” (Ecclesiastes 12:14).
• With confidence: If we are in Christ, we have an Advocate who has never lost a case.
• With urgency: We must share the "everlasting gospel" which announces, "The hour of His judgment is come" (Revelation 14:7).

God desires not to condemn, but to vindicate His people and end the reign of sin forever.
