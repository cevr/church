Study Title: The Reality of Death and Human Condition

Question: Why does death come to every human being?

Biblical Answer: “In Adam all die.” (1 Corinthians 15:22)

Explanation: The Bible teaches that death is not a natural part of God’s original design but an intrusion caused by the Fall. Because all humanity is descended from Adam, we share in the mortality that resulted from sin.

[DYK] The name "Adam" in Hebrew (*Adamah*) relates to the ground or earth. It reminds us that we were formed from the dust, and because of the separation from the Tree of Life in Eden, we return to the dust.

Question: What is the condition of a person while they are in the grave?

Biblical Answer: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” (Ecclesiastes 9:10)

Explanation: This text provides a clear picture of the state of the dead. Rather than transitioning immediately to another realm of conscious existence, the Bible describes death as a state of total inactivity. There is no labor, no planning ("device"), and no mental activity.

[ILL] Consider a light bulb. When the power is switched off, the light doesn't go somewhere else; it simply ceases to exist until the power is restored. Similarly, when the breath of life returns to God, the conscious "soul" ceases to function until the resurrection.

Term Definition: “The Grave” (Hebrew: *Sheol*) generally refers to the unseen state of the dead or the place of the dead, not a place of consciousness or torment.

Question: Can those who have died praise God or continue to think?

Biblical Answer: “In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?” (Psalm 6:5); “His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.” (Psalm 146:4)

Progressive Disclosure:
• The body returns to earth.
• The breath (spirit) returns to God.
• The thoughts (consciousness/personality) perish immediately.

Deeper Insight: This teaching safeguards the believer. If the dead have no "knowledge" or "wisdom," then any appearance of spirits or ghosts communicating with the living cannot be our departed loved ones, but are deceptions. This understanding was a pillar of the SDA pioneers' theology, protecting them from the rise of modern spiritualism.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion:
• The Biblical metaphor of death as "sleep" used by Jesus (John 11:11-14)
• The necessity of a Resurrection: If we went straight to heaven at death, the resurrection would be unnecessary.
• Genesis 2:7 formula: Dust + Breath = Living Soul. (Therefore: Dust - Breath = Dead Soul/Corpse).

Practical Application: Knowing that our time is limited and that no work can be done in the grave, how should we live today?
• Work with "might" and diligence while we have the opportunity.
• Cherish our relationship with God now, while we can consciously praise Him.
• Place our hope not in death itself, but in the future resurrection when Christ calls us to wake.
