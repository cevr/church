Study Title: The New Testament Sabbath: Custom and Commandment

Question: How does the New Testament distinguish between the Sabbath and the first day of the week?

Biblical Answer: “In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.” (Matthew 28:1)

Explanation: Matthew, writing under inspiration long after the resurrection, clearly distinguishes the two days. The Sabbath is the seventh day; the "first day" (now known as Sunday) follows it. The two are not treated as the same institution.

[DYK] In the biblical reckoning of time, days begin at sunset. This is why the text mentions the Sabbath ending as the new day dawns or begins.

Question: Did the followers of Jesus keep the Sabbath immediately after His crucifixion?

Biblical Answer: “And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment.” (Luke 23:56)

Explanation: Even in their grief and urgency to care for Jesus' body, the women waited. They prepared materials on the preparation day (Friday), rested on the Sabbath "according to the commandment," and returned to the tomb on the first day (Sunday).

Term Definition: "According to the commandment" refers to the Fourth Commandment in Exodus 20:8-11, which identifies the seventh day as the time of rest.

[ILL] Imagine a soldier who follows orders even when the General is absent or has fallen. These women showed their loyalty to God’s law even while Jesus lay in the grave. Their obedience was not based on legalism, but on a habit of holiness.

Question: Did Jesus expect His followers to keep the Sabbath after His ascension?

Biblical Answer: “But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.” (Matthew 24:20)

Explanation: Jesus was predicting the destruction of Jerusalem, which occurred in A.D. 70—nearly 40 years after His resurrection. He instructed His disciples to pray that their escape would not happen on the Sabbath, implying the day would still be sacred and observing it would still be a concern for believers decades into the Christian era.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Why pray about the winter or the Sabbath? Flight in winter is physically difficult due to weather; flight on the Sabbath is spiritually difficult for one who wishes to keep the day holy. This indicates Jesus intended the Sabbath rest to remain a blessing, not a burden, even amidst tribulation.

Question: What was the custom of the Apostle Paul regarding the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath days reasoned with them out of the Scriptures.” (Acts 17:2)

Progressive Disclosure:
• Paul’s manner was consistent (Acts 17:2).
• He preached to Jews and Gentiles on this day (Acts 13:42, 44).
• He worked as a tentmaker during the week but reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath (Acts 18:3-4).

Explanation: The book of Acts records 84 specific Sabbaths where Paul held religious services. While he preached daily when possible, the Sabbath was the specific day for gathering and "reasoning" from the Scriptures.

[DYK] In Acts 13:42, the Gentiles specifically asked Paul to preach to them "the next Sabbath." If the "first day" had replaced the Sabbath, Paul could have simply invited them to a meeting the very next day (Sunday). Instead, they waited for the Sabbath.

Question: Which day is the "Lord's Day" mentioned in Revelation?

Biblical Answer: “I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day...” (Revelation 1:10)

To identify which day is the Lord's, we must ask scripture who is the Lord of the Sabbath:
“Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.” (Mark 2:28)
“If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day...” (Isaiah 58:13)

Explanation: The only day the Bible designates as "holy to the Lord" is the seventh-day Sabbath. Therefore, when John speaks of the "Lord's Day," Scripture directs us to the Sabbath.

Deeper Insight: Hebrews 1:1-2 tells us God made the worlds through His Son. Since Jesus is the active agent of Creation, He is the One who rested on the first seventh day. He is the Lord of the Sabbath by right of creation.

[ILL] If a man buys a field, he is the "lord" of that field. Jesus made the Sabbath at Creation; therefore, He is the Lord of it. It is His property, designed for our benefit.

Practical Application:
The New Testament record is consistent:
• Jesus kept it (Luke 4:16).
• The disciples kept it (Luke 23:56).
• Paul kept it (Acts 17:2).
• Jesus is Lord of it (Mark 2:28).

We are invited to follow the footsteps of Jesus and the apostles by finding rest and communion with God on His holy day.
