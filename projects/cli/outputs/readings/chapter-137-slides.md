Slide 3 Explanation: Dictionaries define hospitality merely as receiving guests. Scripture defines it as an active expression of love—the practical fulfillment of the command to "love thy neighbor as thyself."

Slide 4 Term Definition: "Charity" in the biblical sense is not merely giving money; it is supreme, self-sacrificing love that seeks the good of others.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, hospitality was crucial for survival. There were no hotels in the desert; refusing hospitality could mean death for a traveler. God reminds Israel to love the stranger because they were once strangers in Egypt (Deut 10:19).

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers.” (Heb. 13:2); “Use hospitality one to another.” (1 Peter 4:9)

Slide 7 Explanation: Hospitality is a duty for all believers, essential to Christian character. Even church leaders are specifically required to be "given to hospitality" (1 Tim. 3:2).

[SN] For the early Advent believers and pioneers, hospitality was a necessity of the "traveling ministry." Preachers stayed in the homes of members, binding the flock together. This duty creates a network of care within the body of Christ.

Slide 8 Question: To whom should we show this kindness?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.” (Gal. 6:10)

Slide 10 Who to Welcome:
• Fellow Believers
• Strangers (Lev. 19:34)
• The Poor (James 2:1-4)
• Enemies (Rom. 12:20)

---

Slide 11 Explanation: We are warned against partiality. True hospitality is blind to social status. Feeding an enemy acts as "coals of fire," melting hardness with kindness.

[ILL] Imagine a doctor who only treats healthy people. Hospitality that is only extended to friends who can repay the favor is like that doctor. True biblical hospitality is a hospital for the soul, open to those who cannot pay us back.

Slide 14 Explanation: The action of opening one's home must be matched by the condition of the heart. Service given with resentment "profiteth me nothing" (1 Cor. 13:3).

Slide 15 Question: Who are we actually welcoming when we serve others?

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.” (Matt. 25:40)

Slide 17 Deeper Insight: When we open our doors to the unfortunate, we are physically serving a human, but spiritually serving the Messiah.

[SN] Tangent on Prophetic Reward: The text mentions that receiving a prophet yields a "prophet's reward" (Matt 10:41). This suggests that by physically sustaining those who carry God's message, the host shares in the spiritual fruit of that messenger's labor.

Slide 18 Question: What biblical example sets the standard for hospitality?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Patriarch Abraham sitting at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “...and when he [Abraham] saw them, he ran to meet them... And Abraham hastened into the tent... make ready quickly... and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.” (Gen. 18:2-8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham bowing low before three visitors.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Abraham did not wait to be asked; he "ran" to meet them. His service was prompt, generous (the best calf), and humble—he stood by to serve while they ate.

Slide 21 Question: Does the giver lose anything by being generous?

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.” (Prov. 19:17)

---

Slide 23 Explanation: We expect no reward from the *guest*, but God ensures the *host* will not lack. Kindness to the poor is viewed as a loan to God Himself, which He always repays.
