Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream... Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven strove upon the great sea. And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.” (Daniel 7:1-3)

---

Slide 3 Historical Context: This vision occurred toward the end of the Babylonian empire. God was pulling back the curtain of history for Daniel, using symbols to describe the rise and fall of nations.

[DYK] Belshazzar was the final king of Babylon. This vision was given to Daniel shortly before the famous "handwriting on the wall" event in Daniel chapter 5, meaning Daniel knew the empire was doomed before the palace banquet ever began.

Slide 4 Term Definitions:
*   **"Winds"**: Symbolic of political commotion, war, strife, and the scattering of nations (Jeremiah 25:31-33).
*   **"Sea" or "Waters"**: Symbolic of multitudes of people, nations, and tongues (Revelation 17:15).

**Meaning:** "Winds striving on the sea" represents war and conquest among the populated nations of the earth.

Slide 5 Question: What do the four beasts represent?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of four distinct silhouettes of animals standing on a horizon, illuminated by a golden dawn.

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.” (Daniel 7:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of four kings wearing crowns, standing in a row, historically respectful.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The Bible interprets itself. We do not need to guess; these beasts are four distinct universal empires that would rule consecutively.

[ILL] Today, we still use animals to represent nations in political cartoons—the American Eagle, the Russian Bear, or the British Lion. God used similar symbols 2,500 years ago to describe the nature of these kingdoms.

Slide 8 Question: How are the first three kingdoms described?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a detailed lion, bear, and leopard interacting in a natural setting.

Slide 9 Biblical Answer:
1.  **The Lion:** “The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings...” (Daniel 7:4)
2.  **The Bear:** “And behold another beast... like to a bear... it had three ribs in the mouth of it...” (Daniel 7:5)
3.  **The Leopard:** “...like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings... the beast had also four heads...” (Daniel 7:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a triptych (three panels) showing a winged lion, a bear with ribs, and a four-headed leopard.

---

Slide 10 The Lion: **Babylon (605–539 B.C.)**
*   The king of beasts with the wings of the king of birds.
*   Corresponds to the Head of Gold in Daniel 2.
*   The wings being plucked represents the empire losing its boldness before its fall.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Note the specificity of prophecy. Babylon was known for its winged lions—archaeologists have excavated massive winged lion statues from the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh. God used symbols the people of that time would recognize.

Slide 11 The Bear: **Medo-Persia (539–331 B.C.)**
*   Raised on one side: The Persians were stronger than the Medes.
*   Three ribs: Represents the three powers it conquered—Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt.

---

Slide 12 The Leopard: **Greece (331–168 B.C.)**
*   **Speed:** A leopard is naturally fast; with four wings, it denotes supernatural speed (Alexander the Great's conquest).
*   **Four Heads:** The four generals who divided the empire after Alexander's death.

Slide 13 Question: How is the fourth kingdom described, and what makes it unique?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shadowy, fearsome creature that does not resemble a natural animal, silhouetted against a dark sky.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “...behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces... and it had ten horns.” (Daniel 7:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a terrifying beast with metallic iron teeth crushing stones, historically respectful but intense.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: **The Roman Empire (168 B.C.–476 A.D.)**
*   Corresponds to the legs of iron in Daniel 2.
*   **Ruthless:** Described as "dreadful and terrible" with "iron teeth."
*   **Unique:** It was not conquered by a fifth empire; it evolved and broke apart.

Slide 16 Question: What do the ten horns signify?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the head of the fourth beast, focusing on the ten horns upon its head.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise...” (Daniel 7:24)

**Explanation:** Rome broke apart into ten divisions, corresponding to the barbarian tribes that settled in Europe (Ostrogoths, Visigoths, Franks, Vandals, etc.).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a map of Europe divided into different colored regions, representing the tribes.

Slide 18 Progressive Disclosure: The Timeline
*   **The Lion:** Babylon
*   **The Bear:** Medo-Persia
*   **The Leopard:** Greece
*   **The Fourth Beast:** Rome
*   **The Ten Horns:** Divided Europe (476 A.D.–Present)

[SN] A note on Historicism: The pioneers of the Advent movement understood that prophecy is a continuous timeline. The "other" horn rising *after* the ten points to a religious-political power rising out of the ruins of Rome, setting the stage for the judgment.

Slide 19 Practical Application: Why does this matter?
1.  **Sovereignty:** History is not random; God foretold the rise and fall of nations.
2.  **Trust:** If God accurately predicted the past, we can trust His promises for the future Kingdom.
3.  **Perspective:** Earthly kingdoms are predatory and temporary. We belong to a Kingdom that cannot be destroyed.
