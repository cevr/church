Study Title: The New Birth: Transforming the Heart

Question: What is the natural spiritual condition of every human being?

Biblical Answer: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” (Romans 3:23)
“Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.” (Jeremiah 13:23)

Explanation: Scripture teaches that humanity is naturally separated from God. Just as a leopard cannot will its spots away because they are part of its nature, we cannot change our sinful nature through sheer willpower or self-improvement. We are dependent on an outside power for transformation.

[ILL] You can paint a leopard white, but it remains a leopard underneath; the spots will eventually show through. Similarly, outward behavior modification does not change the heart. The nature itself must be changed.

Question: Since we cannot change ourselves, how are we brought back to God?

Biblical Answer: “For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God...” (1 Peter 3:18)
“I am the vine, ye are the branches... for without Me ye can do nothing.” (John 15:5)

Explanation: The bridge between a sinful human and a holy God is Jesus Christ. He does not merely help us improve; He is the vital source of life. Just as a branch dies if cut from the vine, we have no spiritual power unless connected to Him.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The "Vine and Branch" imagery implies a constant, living flow of nourishment. It is not a one-time contact, but an abiding relationship where the life of Christ (the sap) flows into the believer (the branch) to produce fruit.

Question: What does Jesus call this radical change, and how important is it?

Biblical Answer: “Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3)

Explanation: Jesus uses the term "born again" (or born from above). This indicates that the Christian life is not a modification of the old life, but the beginning of an entirely new existence.

[DYK] Nicodemus, to whom Jesus spoke these words, was a religious leader and a strict commandment-keeper. Yet, Jesus told him that religious practice was not enough—he needed a new heart and a new spirit.

Question: How is this new birth accomplished?

Biblical Answer: “Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.” (1 Peter 1:23)
“The wind bloweth where it listeth... so is everyone that is born of the Spirit.” (John 3:8)

Explanation: The agent of the new birth is the Holy Spirit working through the Word of God. We may not always understand the exact process—just as we cannot see the wind, only its effects—but when the Word is received into the heart, the Spirit brings new life.

Question: What is the visible evidence that a person has been born again?

Biblical Answer: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance.” (Galatians 5:22-23)
“If ye know that He is righteous, ye know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of Him.” (1 John 2:29)

Progressive Disclosure: • A change in desires (Works of flesh vs. Fruit of Spirit) • A love for righteousness • Victory over the world • Love for the brethren

Term Definition: “Righteousness” in Scripture is defined as conformity to God’s law. Psalm 119:172 says, “all thy commandments are righteousness.” Therefore, the new birth results in a heart that naturally loves and obeys God’s law, not to earn salvation, but as a fruit of the Spirit.

[SN] The Contrast of Laws: Romans 8:2 speaks of the "law of the Spirit of life" freeing us from the "law of sin and death." This does not mean the Ten Commandments are abolished. Rather, the "law of sin" (our selfish nature) is overcome by a higher power (the Spirit), enabling us to fulfill the righteous requirement of God's moral law.

Question: What happens to the old life of condemnation?

Biblical Answer: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.” (Romans 8:1)
“Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Explanation: When born again, the believer passes from death to life. The guilt of the past is washed away, and a new power is given to live victoriously. The struggle between flesh and Spirit may continue, but the "new creature" is no longer a slave to sin.

Deeper Insight: The victory described in 1 John 5:4 ("this is the victory... even our faith") suggests that overcoming the world is not achieved by human effort, but by maintaining our faith connection to the Conqueror, Jesus Christ.

Practical Application: How do we experience this daily?
• Acknowledge our inability to change our own hearts.
• Invite the Holy Spirit to apply the Word to our lives.
• "Reckon" (consider) ourselves dead to sin and alive to God (Romans 6:11).
• Look for the fruit: Are we growing in patience, love, and obedience?
