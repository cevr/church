---

Slide 1 Question: What is the definition of "presumption"?

---

Slide 2 Answer: "The act of believing upon probable evidence, or taking for granted; belief upon incomplete proof; opinion. The act of venturing beyond due bounds... unreasonable confidence." (Webster’s Dictionary)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Presumption is a spiritual counterfeit of faith. True faith claims God's promises while obeying His word. Presumption claims God's blessings while disregarding His conditions. It is assuming God's protection while willfully choosing a forbidden path.

Slide 4 Illustration: Imagine a child holding a parent's hand to cross a busy street; that is faith and trust. Now imagine the child letting go and running into traffic, assuming the parent will somehow magically stop the cars; that is presumption.

Slide 5 Question: How does God view acts of presumption?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: "But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously... the same reproacheth the Lord; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people." (Numbers 15:30)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: To act presumptuously is to act "high-handedly," or in open rebellion. It is considered a reproach—an insult—to God because it implies that the human will is superior to divine command.

Slide 8 Question: What happened when the Israelites attempted to fight their enemies without God’s permission?

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: "But they presumed to go up unto the hilltop: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses departed not out of the camp... Then the Amalekites came down... and smote them..." (Numbers 14:44-45)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a chaotic battle scene on a rocky hillside, with Israelite soldiers retreating in defeat under a harsh sun.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: The Israelites tried to "make up" for past disobedience by attacking without God's presence. Zeal without obedience is not faith; it is presumption. Success is found only in moving when the cloud moves and staying when the cloud stays.

---

Slide 11 Spirit-Led Insight: The Ark of the Covenant represented the very throne of God. By leaving the Ark behind, the army was essentially trying to fight spiritual battles with carnal weapons, separated from the source of their strength.

Slide 12 Question: How serious is the act of altering God's specific instructions regarding worship?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two priests, Nadab and Abihu, holding censers, approaching the sanctuary entrance with a casual demeanor.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: "And Nadab and Abihu... offered strange fire before the Lord, which He commanded them not. And there went out fire from the Lord, and devoured them..." (Leviticus 10:1, 2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sudden, intense flash of divine fire near the altar, creating a dramatic and solemn scene.

---

Slide 14 Definition: "Strange Fire" refers to common fire. The altar fire was originally kindled by God and was to be kept burning. Nadab and Abihu treated the holy as common, substituting their own method for God's command.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a bronze altar with a steady, holy fire burning, contrasted with a priest holding a torch with a flickering, smoky common flame.

---

Slide 15 Did You Know? In the ancient mindset, fire represented the presence and acceptance of a deity. By using "strange fire," these priests were effectively creating a self-made religion rather than ministering in the religion God established.

Slide 16 Question: How is the sin of presumption described in Bible prophecy regarding the "Little Horn" power?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the prophet Daniel asleep, a dream vision forming above him of ancient kingdoms and symbols.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: "And he shall speak great words against the Most High... and think to change times and laws." (Daniel 7:25)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king sitting on a high throne, holding a scepter, appearing to speak boastfully to a crowd.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The ultimate presumption is for a human power to place itself above the Creator. This prophecy points to the historical claim of authority to alter God's immutable law—specifically the Ten Commandments and the Sabbath.

---

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: Paul calls this power the "man of sin" who "exalteth himself above all that is called God" (2 Thess 2:3-4). While Jesus humbled Himself to save humanity, the spirit of presumption exalts self to replace God.

Slide 20 Question: What was King David’s prayer to be protected from this danger?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of King David wearing royal robes but kneeling on a stone floor in deep, humble prayer.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: "Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me; then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression." (Psalm 19:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man looking up toward a light from heaven, hands open in a gesture of surrender and request for help.

---

Slide 22 Explanation: David realized he could not keep himself; he needed God to "keep back" his natural impulses. Presumptuous sin, if left unchecked, leads to a state of rebellion where the conscience is seared.

---

Slide 23 Theology Note: This connects to the "Unpardonable Sin." Genesis 6:3 states, "My Spirit shall not always strive with man." Presumption is dangerous because it eventually silences the conviction of the Holy Spirit.

---

Slide 24 Practical Application: How do we avoid presumption?
1. **Check the Word:** Do not assume God approves if it contradicts Scripture.
2. **Examine Motives:** Are we acting out of faith (obedience) or arrogance (self-will)?

---

Slide 25 Final Thought:
3. **Pray for Restraint:** Like David, pray for God to keep us back from willful sin.

God desires us to be bold in faith, but humble in walk. Faith takes God at His word; presumption takes God for granted.
