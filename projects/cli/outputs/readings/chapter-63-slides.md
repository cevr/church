Study Title: The Resurrection of the Just

---

Slide 1 Question: What is the primary result of the fall of man, and what is his condition in the grave?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam and Eve walking away from the Garden of Eden, shadows lengthening, conveying a sense of loss and mortality.

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12)

---

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” (Ecclesiastes 9:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a sealed stone tomb in a quiet garden, still and silent under the moonlight.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: The Bible teaches that death is an intruder, entered through sin, not a natural part of creation. When a person dies, they enter a state of silence. There is no conscious "work" or "wisdom" in the grave; they are simply waiting.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a quiet resting place, soft light illuminating a stillness that suggests waiting rather than activity.

---

Slide 5 Did You Know? The Hebrew word for grave here is *Sheol*. It refers to the realm of the dead where there is no activity or consciousness, often described in Scripture as a "sleep."

---

Slide 6 Term Definition: **"Passed upon all men"**

This indicates that mortality is the shared inheritance of humanity stemming from Adam. We are subject to death because we share in this fallen nature.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a diverse crowd of people from ancient times, representing the shared lineage of humanity.

---

Slide 7 Question: Who provides the solution to death, and what is that solution?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single ray of bright light breaking through heavy, dark storm clouds.

---

Slide 8 Biblical Answer: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.” (Hosea 13:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of heavy iron chains lying broken on the ground, illuminated by a golden sunrise.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so In Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:21, 22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ standing with open arms, radiating a warm, life-giving light that contrasts with the shadows behind Him.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: Just as death came through a man (Adam), life comes through a Man (Christ). Jesus does not merely help us avoid death; He *ransoms* us from it. He enters the grave to break its power.

---

Slide 11 Illustration: Imagine a debt so large that it lands a person in a debtor's prison with no hope of release. A benefactor pays the ransom to open the door. Christ pays the debt of sin to open the doors of the grave.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a prisoner in a dimly lit cell looking up as a heavy door swings open, revealing bright light outside.

---

Slide 12 Speaker Note: This creates a beautiful parallel: Adam, the head of the fallen race, brought death. Christ, the "Second Adam," is the head of the new, spiritual race, bringing life.

Slide 13 Question: Why is the resurrection so essential to our faith?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of early believers gathering in a catacomb, their faces illuminated by torchlight, looking hopeful.

---

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” (1 Corinthians 15:16-18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a broken stone pillar, representing something unfinished and tragic without restoration.

---

Slide 15 Explanation: If there were no resurrection, those who died in Christ would be "perished"—ceasing to exist forever. The reward of the righteous is not given at death, but at the resurrection. Without it, there is no future life.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a golden crown resting on a pedestal, waiting to be claimed, not yet worn.

---

Slide 16 Question: When does the resurrection happen, and do all rise at the same time?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vast, ancient landscape dotted with tombs, waiting for the dawn.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth.” (John 5:28, 29)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ speaking with authority, His voice visualized as ripples of light touching the earth.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.” (Revelation 20:4, 5)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a multitude in white robes standing before a throne, while the background remains in shadow.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The dead are "in the graves" until they hear Christ's voice. There are two distinct resurrections. The "First Resurrection" is for the righteous. The "rest of the dead" (the unjust) do not rise until the thousand years end.

[DYK] The concept of two resurrections resolved much confusion for early Advent believers regarding how God deals with the righteous versus the wicked.

Slide 20 Question: What kind of body will the righteous receive at the resurrection?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a farmer sowing seeds in a furrowed field, soft golden hour light.

---

Slide 21 Biblical Answer: “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory... it is sown in a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.” (1 Corinthians 15:42-44)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a green sprout bursting triumphantly through dark soil, glowing faintly.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.” (Philippians 3:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a figure looking upward, their form beginning to shine with a radiant, transfigured light.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: The resurrection is a transformation, not just a resuscitation. We are "sown" like a seed in weakness and mortality. We are "raised" in power and immortality.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, symbolizing a new form emerging from the old.

---

Slide 24 Term Definition: **"Spiritual body"**

This does not mean a ghost. Jesus had a "glorious body" that could be touched and could eat, yet was not bound by earthly limitations. Our new bodies will be like His.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the resurrected Jesus breaking bread with the disciples at Emmaus, solid yet radiant.

---

Slide 25 Illustration: Consider an acorn and an oak tree. The acorn (natural body) is fragile and small. The tree (spiritual body) is glorious and strong, yet they are historically connected.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a small acorn resting on the ground next to the massive roots of a giant oak tree.

---

Slide 26 Question: What is the final destiny of the righteous and of death itself?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a horizon where the sun is rising, banishing all remaining shadows.

---

Slide 27 Biblical Answer: “Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.” (Luke 20:36)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of human figures standing with angels, bathed in the same celestial light, distinct but equal in immortality.

---

Slide 28 Biblical Answer: “The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” (1 Corinthians 15:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a broken scythe and a skull crumbling into dust, symbolizing the end of death.

---

Slide 29 Explanation: The cycle of sin and death is broken forever. The righteous shine, reflecting God's glory. Death, the great enemy, is finally destroyed.

[Deeper Insight] The resurrection is the vindication of God’s character. By restoring what sin destroyed, God proves that His love is stronger than death.

Slide 30 Practical Application: How does this hope affect us today?

*   It removes the paralyzing fear of death.
*   It gives comfort when we lose loved ones.
*   It encourages us to use our current life for God’s glory, knowing our labor is not in vain.
