Study Title: Prophecy, Technology, and the Time of the End

Question: According to the prophet Daniel, when could the world expect a significant increase in travel and knowledge?

Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end; many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

Explanation: The prophecy indicates that the book of Daniel would remain “sealed”—or not fully understood—until a specific period called the “time of the end.” During this specific era, two things would happen: distinct research into Bible prophecy (running to and fro in the Scriptures) and a literal explosion of general knowledge and travel.

[DYK] For thousands of years, human speed was limited to the speed of a horse. From the time of Abraham to George Washington, transportation methods remained virtually unchanged. Suddenly, in the 19th century, the "time of the end" began, and humanity moved from horses to steam engines, to flight, and to digital speed in a very short historical window.

Question: When does this "time of the end" begin?

Biblical Answer: “And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.” (Daniel 11:35) AND “...they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.” (Daniel 7:25)

Explanation: The “time of the end” is a specific appointment in God's calendar. It begins when the period of dominance by the “little horn” power (which persecuted the saints) concludes. Historically and prophetically, this period—the 1260 years of papal supremacy—ended in 1798. Therefore, the "time of the end" began in 1798.

Term Definition: **Time, Times, and Dividing of Time**: In biblical prophecy, a "time" represents a year. This phrase equals 3.5 prophetic years, or 1260 prophetic days. Using the day-for-a-year principle (Ezekiel 4:6), this spans the 1260 years of the Dark Ages, ending in 1798.

Question: Does history support the idea that knowledge exploded after 1798?

Biblical Answer: (Historical observation confirms the prophecy)

Explanation: The 19th century saw a sudden, unprecedented rise in invention. Before 1798, technology moved slowly. Immediately following this date, we see:
*   1807: The Steamboat
*   1811: Steam printing-press
*   1825: Railroad cars
*   1837: Telegraph
*   1876: Telephone

[ILL] Imagine a graph line that stays flat for 5,000 years, representing human technological progress. Suddenly, right around the year 1800, the line shoots vertically upward. This is exactly what history records, perfectly matching Daniel's prediction for the "time of the end."

Question: What is God’s purpose for this sudden increase in technology and rapid transit?

Biblical Answer: “And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.” (Matthew 24:14)

Explanation: God does not increase knowledge merely for human convenience. There is a design in it. To warn the final generation, the message of Christ's return must go to the whole world quickly. Lightning-fast communication and rapid travel were gifted to humanity to facilitate the spreading of the Gospel.

[SN] **The Roman Roads and the Internet**: Just as God used the *Pax Romana* and the Roman road system to facilitate the spread of the Gospel at Jesus' First Advent, He has allowed the invention of the internet, air travel, and mass media to facilitate the message of His Second Advent. The technology serves the theology.

Question: What does the fulfillment of these signs tell us about our current location in history?

Biblical Answer: “So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.” (Matthew 24:33)

Explanation: We are not waiting for the "time of the end" to begin; we have been living in it since 1798. The increase of knowledge is an accomplished fact. The gospel is reaching nearly every tribe. This indicates that the next major event is the return of Christ.

Deeper Insight: Earlier reformers like Luther or Wesley could not preach that the end was immediately "at the doors" because the signs (like the increase of knowledge and the end of the 1260 years) had not yet been fulfilled. We, however, have the privilege and responsibility of seeing the completed prophecy.

Practical Application: We have access to more knowledge and faster communication than any generation in history. The question is: How are we using it?
*   Do we use our technology to "run to and fro" in the Scriptures?
*   Do we use our communication tools to share the "gospel of the kingdom"?
*   Are we awake to the fact that the end is "at the doors"?
