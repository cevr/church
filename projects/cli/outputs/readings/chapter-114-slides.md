---

Slide 1 Question: In the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, where are the two men represented as going after death?

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom... The rich man also died, and was buried; and in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments.” (Luke 16:22-23)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The story presents a dramatic contrast. Lazarus is comforted in a place of honor, while the rich man is in torment. To understand if this is literal or symbolic, we must examine internal evidence and compare it with other Scripture.

Slide 4 Did You Know? The phrase "Abraham's bosom" was a common Jewish idiom in the first century. It represented a place of honor at a banquet—similar to John leaning on Jesus at the Last Supper. It signifies an intimate relationship with the father of the faithful, rather than a specific geographical location.

Slide 5 Question: When the rich man asks for Lazarus to be sent to warn his brothers, what does the text imply about Lazarus's state?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.” (Luke 16:31)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: The rich man thought a visit "from the dead" would convince his brothers. Jesus’ conclusion emphasizes that for Lazarus to visit, he would have to "rise from the dead." This implies Lazarus was in the grave awaiting resurrection, not alive in a spirit world.

Slide 8 Question: According to Scripture, when are the unjust actually punished? Is it immediately at death?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.” (2 Peter 2:9)

---

Slide 10 Term Definition: **Reserve**
To keep back or hold in store. The wicked are held in the sleep of death until a specific future time.

Slide 11 Question: When does this judgment and the rewarding of the righteous take place?

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “...who shall judge the quick and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom.” (2 Timothy 4:1); “...for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.” (Luke 14:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ returning in glory, clouds parting, signifying the "appearing" and the kingdom.

---

Slide 13 Progressive Disclosure:
1. The wicked are **"reserved"** for judgment (2 Peter 2:9).
2. Judgment happens at **Christ's "appearing"** (2 Tim 4:1).
3. Rewards happen at the **"resurrection"** (Luke 14:14).

Conclusion: The rich man cannot literally be in the fire of punishment immediately after death, as the judgment has not yet occurred.

Slide 14 Illustration: Consider a person charged with a crime. They are placed in a holding cell (reserved) until their court date. They are not sent to prison to serve their sentence until the judge has issued the verdict. God, the Righteous Judge, follows due process; He does not punish before judgment.

Slide 15 Question: If the dead are sleeping until the resurrection, why does Jesus tell a story where they are talking?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two figures in conversation, but with a dreamlike or ethereal quality, suggesting a narrative rather than physical reality.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) before Him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.” (Romans 4:17)

Slide 17 Explanation: Jesus is using a figure of speech called **Personification**. This is where inanimate objects or abstract ideas are given human qualities to teach a lesson.

---

Slide 18 Term Definition: **Personification**
A literary device where non-living things act as if they are alive.
*   Genesis 4:10 - Abel's blood "crieth" from the ground.
*   Habakkuk 2:11 - The "stone shall cry out of the wall."

Slide 19 Deeper Insight: In this parable, Jesus used the common (though erroneous) beliefs of the Pharisees to refute them on their own ground. He was not teaching the geography of heaven or hell, but rather the moral truth that our destiny is decided in this life, and that wealth is not a sign of God's favor.

Slide 20 Key Takeaways: The Sufficiency of Scripture
Abraham tells the rich man that his brothers have "Moses and the prophets." This teaches that miracles (even raising the dead) will not convince a heart that rejects the written Word of God.

Slide 21 Key Takeaways: The Great Gulf
The "great gulf fixed" (Luke 16:26) represents the finality of death. Once life is over, character cannot be changed.

---

Slide 22 Practical Application:
*   **Decide Now:** We cannot change our destiny after death.
*   **Trust the Word:** Faith is based on Scripture, not supernatural signs.
*   **Stewardship:** Use God's blessings to help the "Lazarus" at your gate.
