Study Title: The Temple of the Holy Spirit: God's Plan for Good Health

Question: What is God's desire regarding our physical health?

Biblical Answer: “Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.” (3 John 1:2)

Explanation: The Apostle John connects physical well-being with spiritual prosperity. God does not delight in disease or weakness; His plan is for us to have vigor so that we may serve Him effectively.

[DYK] The Greek word for "prosper" here suggests a successful journey. The Bible views life as a holistic journey where the condition of the body often impacts the condition of the mind and spirit.

Question: How does the Bible describe the believer’s body?

Biblical Answer: “What! know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.” (1 Corinthians 6:19-20)

Explanation: A temple is a sacred place dedicated to worship. Because the Holy Spirit dwells within the believer, the physical body is not personal property to be used however one pleases. It belongs to God by creation and by redemption (being "bought with a price" refers to the blood of Jesus).

[ILL] If a King entrusted you to take care of his palace while he was away, you would not throw trash in the hallways or break the windows. You would maintain it with the highest honor. Similarly, we are caretakers of the body God owns.

Question: Does true sanctification involve the physical body?

Biblical Answer: “And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (1 Thessalonians 5:23)

Term Definition: **Sanctify** means to set apart for a holy use. The text emphasizes that this setting apart includes the "whole" man—not just the spirit, but the physical body as well.

Deeper Insight: Holiness is not merely an abstract spiritual concept; it is practical. A body weakened by intemperate habits cannot serve God as effectively as a healthy one. The mind, which communicates with God, is sustained by the body. Therefore, physical habits are a matter of religious duty.

Question: What is the biblical guideline for eating and drinking?

Biblical Answer: “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:31)

Explanation: Every act of life, including the daily routine of eating, should be done with God’s glory in mind. If a habit destroys health or clouds the mind, it cannot glorify God.

[SN] **A Spirit-led connection:** Consider the experience of Daniel in Babylon. He "purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat" (Daniel 1:8). Daniel understood that what he put into his body affected his spiritual integrity and his witness to the pagan world.

Question: Has God given specific instructions regarding which meats are clean and which are unclean?

Biblical Answer: “And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.” (Deuteronomy 14:8; see also Leviticus 11)

Explanation: God distinguished between "clean" animals (like cattle, sheep, and deer) and "unclean" animals (like swine/pigs). The swine is a scavenger and was forbidden by God to His people to preserve their health and holiness.

[DYK] This distinction was not just for the Jews; in Genesis 7:2, long before there was a Jewish nation, Noah was instructed to take clean beasts by sevens and unclean beasts by twos onto the ark.

Question: What was the original, ideal diet given to humanity at Creation?

Biblical Answer: “And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed... and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.” (Genesis 1:29)

Explanation: In the perfect environment of Eden, before sin and death entered, the diet consisted of fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds. This was the fuel designed for the human machine.

Progressive Disclosure: • The Original Diet (Eden): Plant-based • The Permitted Diet (Post-Flood): Clean meats added • The Restricted Diet: Unclean meats (swine, scavengers) forbidden • The Prophetic Warning: Judgment connects to diet in the end times.

[SN] **Regarding the Second Coming:** Isaiah 66:15-17 describes the Lord coming with fire to judge. It specifically mentions that those who sanctify themselves (in a false manner) while "eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together." This suggests that returning to God's standards of purity is part of preparing for the Second Advent.

Practical Application: How can we apply these health principles today?
• **Evaluate:** Do my eating habits cloud my mind or give me energy to serve?
• **Stewardship:** Do I treat my body as a temple or as a trash can?
• **Submission:** Am I willing to surrender my appetite to the Lord as an act of worship?

God desires us to have clear minds and strong bodies so we can understand His Word and share His love with others.
