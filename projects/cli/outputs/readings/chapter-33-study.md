Study Title: The Promised One: The Birth and Early Life of Jesus

Question: Where does the Bible first promise a Savior from sin?

Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God said unto the serpent,... I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.” (Genesis 3:14, 15)

Explanation: This prophecy, spoken in Eden immediately after the Fall, outlines the "Great Controversy" between good and evil. It promises that a descendant ("seed") of the woman would eventually crush the head of the serpent (Satan), though the Savior would suffer a wound to His "heel" in the process.

Term Definition: **"Enmity"** refers to deep-seated hatred or hostility. In this context, it is a supernatural hostility God places between His people and the forces of darkness to prevent humanity from being totally comfortable in sin.

[SN] This verse is often called the *Protoevangelium* (the first gospel). Even in judgment, God’s first move was to promise a Rescue.

Question: Who is this promised "Seed"?

Biblical Answer: “He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” (Galatians 3:16)

Question: Where did prophecy predict the Christ would be born?

Biblical Answer: “And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea.” (Matthew 2:5, referencing Micah 5:2)

[DYK] Bethlehem means "House of Bread." It is fitting that Jesus, who later called Himself the "Bread of Life," was born in a town associated with sustenance.

Question: What was the nature of His birth and His identity?

Biblical Answer: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.” (Isaiah 7:14)

Also: “For unto us a child is born... and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.” (Isaiah 9:6)

Explanation: These verses reveal the dual nature of Christ. He is born of a woman (human), yet He is "The mighty God" and "Immanuel," which translates to "God with us."

Question: Why was He named "Jesus"?

Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:21)

[ILL] A lifeguard does not merely teach a drowning person how to swim; they dive in to rescue them. Similarly, the name Jesus (Yeshua) means "The Lord Saves." He came not just to teach, but to save us from the condition of sin.

Question: How was the news of His birth received by heaven and earth?

Biblical Answer:
*   **The Angels:** “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.” (Luke 2:14)
*   **Simeon (a godly man):** “Mine eyes have seen thy salvation... a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.” (Luke 2:30-32)
*   **The Wise Men:** “They saw the young child... and fell down, and worshipped Him: and... presented unto Him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.” (Matthew 2:11)

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Notice the diversity of witnesses. Shepherds (the working poor), Simeon and Anna (the faithful elderly), and Wise Men (Gentile intellectuals) all recognized Him. The Gospel is accessible to every class and background.

Question: Did everyone welcome the new King?

Biblical Answer: “Herod... slew all the children that were in Bethlehem... from two years old and under.” (Matthew 2:16)

Deeper Insight: Behind the political jealousy of King Herod was a spiritual force. Revelation describes this as the "dragon" standing before the woman "to devour her child as soon as it was born" (Revelation 12:4). The enemy of souls tried to destroy Jesus in His infancy to prevent the plan of salvation.

[DYK] This event led to the "Flight into Egypt." Just as Israel was called out of Egypt in the Old Testament, Jesus (the new Israel) was called out of Egypt (Matthew 2:15), fulfilling the pattern of deliverance.

Question: What do we know about the childhood and youth of Jesus?

Biblical Answer: “And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon Him.” (Luke 2:40)

Explanation: Jesus did not bypass human development. He grew physically ("stature"), mentally ("wisdom"), and spiritually ("favor with God").

Question: When did Jesus first show an understanding of His specific mission?

Biblical Answer: “And all that heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers.” (Luke 2:47)

Explanation: At age twelve, during the Passover in Jerusalem, Jesus was found in the temple discussing theology with the teachers. He was not merely listening; He was asking questions that revealed deep spiritual insight.

[ILL] Most children at twelve are focused on play or learning a trade. Jesus was focused on "His Father's business." His questions to the rabbis likely gently pointed them back to the true meaning of the prophecies concerning Himself.

Question: How did Jesus treat His earthly parents despite His divine wisdom?

Biblical Answer: “And He went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.” (Luke 2:51)

Practical Application: Even the Son of God submitted to earthly authority and family duties.
*   **Salvation:** Have we accepted the "Seed" who crushed the serpent's head for us?
*   **Growth:** Like Jesus, are we growing in wisdom and favor with God today?
*   **Submission:** If the "Mighty God" was willing to be subject to human parents, can we learn humility in our own relationships?
