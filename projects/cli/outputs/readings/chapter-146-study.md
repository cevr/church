Study Title: The Call to Work: Stewardship and Service

Question: Has God given a specific task to every single person?

Biblical Answer: “For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.” (Mark 13:34)

Explanation: The Scripture compares Jesus to a master who has traveled away (ascended to heaven), leaving his household (the church) in the care of his servants. Notice the specificity: He gives "every man his work." In God's plan, there are no spectators; every believer has a specific role to play and authority to act within that role.

[DYK] In the ancient Roman world, household servants (stewards) often managed entire estates or businesses for their masters. They were not just laborers but trusted administrators given significant autonomy to make decisions while the master was away.

Question: On what basis does God distribute His gifts and responsibilities?

Biblical Answer: “And unto one He gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability...” (Matthew 25:15)

Explanation: God is just and practical. He distributes "talents"—opportunities and resources—based on our ability to handle them. He does not demand five-talent results from a one-talent person, but He does demand faithfulness with what we have.

Term Definition: “Talent” (Greek: *talanton*). In the literal parable, this was a large unit of currency (weighing approx. 75 lbs of silver or gold). Because of this parable, the English word "talent" eventually evolved to mean natural skills or aptitudes. Spiritually, it represents every gift, resource, time, and influence God entrusts to us.

Question: What is the fatal mistake of the unfaithful servant?

Biblical Answer: “And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth... His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant.” (Matthew 25:25-26)

Explanation: The unfaithful servant did not steal the money; he simply did nothing with it. His excuse was fear and a false view of God as a "hard man." The Master calls this "wicked and slothful" (lazy). In the Christian life, negligence is as dangerous as open rebellion. We are called to "trade" with our talents—to use them to advance God's kingdom.

[ILL] Imagine a muscle in the human body. If you wrap it in a cast and refuse to use it for fear of injuring it, it will not remain the same; it will atrophy and wither. Spiritual gifts act the same way—they must be used to grow.

Question: What is the reward for those who faithfully use their talents?

Biblical Answer: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant... enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (Matthew 25:21)

Question: What exactly is this "joy of the Lord" that we are invited to share?

Biblical Answer: “Looking unto Jesus... who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross...” (Hebrews 12:2); “He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.” (Isaiah 53:11); “For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at His coming?” (1 Thessalonians 2:19)

Deep Insight: The "joy" of the Master is not merely relaxation or luxury. It is the joy of seeing souls saved. Jesus endured the Cross for the joy of seeing you saved. When we work to save others, we partake in the very specific joy that sustains God Himself—the joy of redemption.

[SN] The phrase "travail of His soul" (Isaiah 53:11) uses the imagery of childbirth. Just as a mother forgets the pain of labor for the joy of holding her child, Christ views His suffering as worth it when He looks upon the redeemed. Faithful workers share in this "parental" joy of spiritual harvest.

Question: What happens to those who claim to be Christians but produce no fruit?

Biblical Answer: “Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away...” (John 15:2); “He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth.” (Luke 11:23)

Explanation: Neutrality is impossible in the great controversy. Jesus states clearly that if we are not gathering with Him, we are scattering. A branch that consumes sap (blessings) but produces no fruit (service/souls) is eventually removed because it fails its created purpose.

Question: What is our true identity and motive in this work?

Biblical Answer: “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ...” (2 Corinthians 5:20); “For the love of Christ constraineth us...” (2 Corinthians 5:14)

Explanation: We are "ambassadors"—official representatives on foreign soil speaking for the King. Our motive is not guilt or fear, but the "constraining" (compelling) love of Christ. Because He died for all, we live to tell all.

Practical Application:
*   **Identify**: What specific "talent" (time, skill, money, influence) do you have right now?
*   **Action**: Are you "trading" with it (using it to bless others and share Jesus) or "hiding" it (keeping it to yourself)?
*   **Motive**: Are you driven by a fear of God as a "hard master," or by the joy of seeing others saved?

**Prayer thought**: Lord, help us not to bury our opportunities in the earth of worldly cares. Let us be faithful ambassadors, that we may one day share in Your joy over souls redeemed.
