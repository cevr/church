Study Title: The Ladder of Christian Growth

Question: With what command does the Apostle Peter close his writings to the church?

Biblical Answer: “But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.” (2 Peter 3:18)

Explanation: The Christian experience is not a static event; it is a living process. Just as a physical life must grow to remain healthy, spiritual life requires constant expansion in our understanding of Jesus and our experience of His grace.

[DYK] The word "grace" (*charis*) not only refers to God’s unmerited favor that saves us but also to the divine influence upon the heart that empowers us to live a holy life.

Question: How does God enable us to share in His nature and escape the corruption of the world?

Biblical Answer: “Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.” (2 Peter 1:4)

Explanation: We do not escape the world through our own willpower, but by laying hold of God’s promises. By believing what He says and claiming it for ourselves, the power of God actually enters our lives.

[ILL] Imagine a signed check from a billionaire. The paper itself is just paper, but the promise written on it represents real wealth. God’s promises are like that check—when we claim them by faith, we receive the spiritual resources we need.

Question: What specific qualities—often called "Peter's Ladder"—are we to build into our characters?

Biblical Answer: “Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness; and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.” (2 Peter 1:5-7)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Faith**: The foundation. "He that cometh to God must believe" (Hebrews 11:6).
2.  **Virtue**: Moral excellence and courage to do right.
3.  **Knowledge**: Understanding God's will through His Word.
4.  **Temperance**: Self-control and balance in all things.
5.  **Patience**: Endurance under trials.
6.  **Godliness**: A life centered on reverence for God.
7.  **Brotherly Kindness**: Affection for the family of believers.
8.  **Charity**: Self-sacrificing love for all.

Term Definition: “Temperance” in the King James Version refers to self-control (Greek: *egkrateia*). It implies mastery over one’s appetites and passions.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This list is not random; it is sequential. Faith is the root; Virtue is the first shoot. One cannot have true patience without self-control (temperance). One cannot have true charity (love) without godliness. Ellen White and early Adventist pioneers viewed "Sanctification" not as a moment of feeling, but as "the work of a lifetime"—climbing this ladder round by round.

Question: How does the Bible define "Charity," the crowning grace of this ladder?

Biblical Answer: “Charity suffereth long, and is kind... seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked... Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.” (1 Corinthians 13:4-7); “And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.” (Colossians 3:14)

Explanation: Charity is not merely giving money; it is *agape*—the God-kind of love. It is the "bond" or the glue that holds all other virtues together in perfection. Without love, the other virtues are hollow.

Question: What is the result of possessing these qualities versus lacking them?

Biblical Answer: **If possessed:** “They make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2 Peter 1:8)
**If lacked:** “But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.” (2 Peter 1:9)

Explanation: Spiritual stagnation leads to spiritual blindness. If we are not actively adding these graces, we lose sight of the cross and forget the cost of our salvation.

Question: What assurance is given to the Christian who diligently pursues this growth?

Biblical Answer: “If ye do these things, ye shall never fall.” (2 Peter 1:10)

Practical Application:
*   **Self-Examination**: Which step of the ladder are you currently struggling with?
*   **Daily Diligence**: Are you adding "virtue" to your faith today by making moral choices?
*   **Promise Claiming**: When you feel weak in "temperance" or "patience," which "precious promise" can you claim?

Deeper Insight: The text says if we do these things we shall never fall. This suggests that our security in Christ is maintained through a living, growing connection with Him. We are safe as long as we are climbing.
