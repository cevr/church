Study Title: The Repairers of the Breach: A Study on Sabbath Reform

Question: How does Jesus describe worship that replaces God's commandments with human traditions?

Biblical Answer: “But in vain they do worship Me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matthew 15:9)

Explanation: Jesus warns that sincerity alone is not enough; true worship must be grounded in truth. When human customs push aside explicit divine commands, worship becomes "vain" or empty.

[ILL] Imagine a soldier who salutes his general but refuses to follow his marching orders. The salute (worship) means little if the obedience (law) is missing.

Question: What is the destiny of religious institutions or doctrines not established by God?

Biblical Answer: “Every plant which My heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.” (Matthew 15:13)

Explanation: Jesus uses the metaphor of a garden. God planted the Sabbath in Eden (Genesis 2). Any institution planted later by human authority—such as the substitution of Sunday for Saturday—is a "plant" the Father did not plant and will eventually be removed.

[DYK] The weekly cycle of seven days is the only major measurement of time (unlike the day, month, or year) that has no basis in astronomy. It exists solely because God established it at Creation.

Question: How does God describe the neglect of His Sabbath by religious leaders?

Biblical Answer: “Her priests have violated My law... and have hid their eyes from My Sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.” (Ezekiel 22:26)

Term Definition: **"Hid their eyes"** implies a willful ignorance. It suggests looking the other way to avoid acknowledging an inconvenient truth.

[SN] **The Wall and the Mortar:** The text in Ezekiel 13 and 22 compares God’s law to a protective wall. When a gap (breach) appears, false teachers try to fix it with "untempered mortar" (whitewash or weak plaster). This represents using weak arguments or vain assurances ("Peace, peace when there is no peace") to cover up the fact that God's law has been broken.

Question: What title is given to those who restore the true Sabbath in the last days?

Biblical Answer: “And thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.” (Isaiah 58:12)

Explanation: God calls for a movement to rebuild the "wall" of His law. This is not about innovation, but restoration—clearing the debris of tradition to find the ancient path God originally laid down.

Question: What does it mean to "turn away thy foot" from the Sabbath?

Biblical Answer: “If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on My holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable...” (Isaiah 58:13)

Explanation: To "turn away thy foot" means to stop trampling on something. We are called to stop treating holy time as common time. Instead of using the day for personal business or entertainment, we are to view it as a "delight"—a spiritual banquet with the King.

[ILL] If a friend visits your home, you stop your work to focus on them. The Sabbath is a weekly appointment where God visits us; we stop our work to give Him our full attention.

Question: Is the blessing of the Sabbath limited only to the Jewish people?

Biblical Answer: “Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the Lord... everyone that keepeth the Sabbath from polluting it... even them will I bring to My holy mountain.” (Isaiah 56:6-7)

Explanation: The Sabbath was given to mankind (Mark 2:27), not just one nation. In the last days, God invites "strangers" (Gentiles/all nations) to join the covenant by honoring His day.

Question: How are God’s people identified in the final days of earth's history?

Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

Deeper Insight: The "Remnant" (the last remaining piece of faithful fabric) is identified by two characteristics: they hold to the faith *of* Jesus (salvation by grace), and they keep the commandments *of* God (obedience/law). They do not separate faith from obedience.

Question: Will the Sabbath be observed in the New Earth?

Biblical Answer: “For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make... shall remain... from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before Me, saith the Lord.” (Isaiah 66:22-23)

[SN] The Sabbath is the link between Eden lost and Eden restored. It was kept before sin entered the world, and it will be kept after sin is destroyed. It is the eternal sign of God's creative power and authority.

Practical Application:
We are living in the time of the "breach," where God's law is often set aside. The invitation today is to be a "Repairer." This begins by:
• Searching Scripture to distinguish God's plants from man's plants.
• Hallowing the Sabbath in our own homes as a delight.
• Trusting in the "faith of Jesus" to give us power to obey.
