Study Title: The Harmony of Law and Gospel

Question: What is the "Gospel" and what power does it hold?

Biblical Answer: “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth.” (Romans 1:16)

Explanation: The word "Gospel" translates to "Good News." This news is not merely information; it is active power. It is the announcement that a Savior has come to rescue humanity from the condition of sin.

[DYK] The name "Jesus" (Yeshua) literally means "Jehovah is Salvation." The very name of the Messiah announces His mission: "He shall save His people from their sins" (Matthew 1:21).

Question: Was this "Good News" available to people in the Old Testament, before Jesus was born?

Biblical Answer: “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham.” (Galatians 3:8)

Progressive Disclosure: • The Gospel is eternal • Abraham was justified by faith • Old Testament sacrifices pointed toward Christ

Explanation: The Gospel was not a new invention in the New Testament. Believers in the Old Testament (the "old dispensation") were saved by the same method we are: faith in the Savior. While we look backward to the Cross, they looked forward to it through the "shadow" of the ceremonial service (Hebrews 10:1).

[ILL] Think of a shadow cast by a person walking around a corner. You see the shadow before you see the person, but the shadow proves the person is coming. The Old Testament ceremonies were the shadow; Jesus is the reality.

Question: How did people know they needed a Savior in the first place?

Biblical Answer: “...for by the law is the knowledge of sin.” (Romans 3:20)

Explanation: You cannot appreciate a cure until you realize you have a disease. The Law of God acts as a mirror; it reveals our moral defects and defines what sin is. Without the Law to define sin, there is no need for the Gospel to save us from it.

Term Definition: **Dispensation** – A period of time in which God manages or administers His relationship with humanity. The source text refers to the "Old Dispensation" (before the Cross) and the "Christian Dispensation" (after the Cross).

Question: Did Jesus come to abolish or destroy the Law so we wouldn't have to worry about it?

Biblical Answer: “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.” (Matthew 5:17)

Explanation: "Fulfill" here means to fill up or to carry out its design. The Law was originally ordained to bring life (Romans 7:10), but because of our transgression, it brought condemnation. Jesus came to live out the perfect righteousness of the Law and to pay the penalty for our breaking of it.

[SN] **The Logic of the Cross:** If the Law could have been changed or abolished, Jesus would not have needed to die. The fact that Christ had to pay the penalty proves that the Law is immutable (unchangeable). He died to satisfy the claims of the Law so that the sinner could be saved.

Question: Does having faith in Jesus mean we make the Law void (empty or useless)?

Biblical Answer: “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.” (Romans 3:31)

Deeper Insight: Faith and Law are friends, not enemies. The Law guides us to Christ by showing us our sin. Christ then forgives us and writes that same Law in our hearts, empowering us to obey it through love.

Question: How does the Bible describe the final group of saved people at the end of time?

Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

Explanation: In the closing scenes of history, God’s people are identified by two distinct markers: they possess the faith *of* Jesus (trusting wholly in His merits for salvation), and as a fruit of that faith, they keep the commandments of God.

[ILL] A passport requires two stamps to be valid for entry in some analogies: The blood of Christ (The Gospel) clears our past, and the obedience of faith (The Law) marks our present walk. We are saved *by* grace, *for* a life of obedience.

Practical Application:
1.  **Mirror Check:** Use the Law to examine your heart—not to save yourself, but to see your need.
2.  **Look to the Lamb:** When the Law condemns you, look immediately to Jesus, our Advocate (1 John 2:1).
3.  **Walk in Harmony:** Allow the Holy Spirit to help you live out God’s commands as a response of love, not obligation.
