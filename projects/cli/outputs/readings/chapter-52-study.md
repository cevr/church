Study Title: The Third Angel's Message: The Final Warning

Question: Against whose worship does the Bible issue its most solemn warning?

Biblical Answer: “If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God.” (Revelation 14:9, 10)

Explanation: The Third Angel’s Message is the final call to humanity. It warns against false worship and shifting loyalty from God to human systems. It identifies a "beast," an "image," and a "mark" as things to be avoided at all costs.

[DYK] In prophecy, a "beast" is not a monster, but a symbol of a political power or kingdom (see Daniel 7:17, 23). The Bible uses symbols to portray the character and actions of nations.

Question: What is the first power (beast) identified in this conflict?

Biblical Answer: “And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns... and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.” (Revelation 13:1, 7)

Explanation: This first power arises from the "sea" (representing multitudes/people, see Rev. 17:15). It is a persecuting power that makes war with the saints.
*   **Historical Identification:** The source text notes that this symbol represents the Roman Church system, which held sway over kings and nations for centuries, historically persecuting those who dissented.

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The "Sea" vs. The "Earth": In Revelation 13, the first beast comes from the "sea" (populated areas/Old World). The second beast comes from the "earth" (a new, relatively unpopulated area). This geographic distinction helps identify the players in the final events.

Question: What second power arises to aid the first?

Biblical Answer: “And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.” (Revelation 13:11)

Explanation: This second power appears gentle ("like a lamb") and arises in a new territory ("earth"). However, its speech (laws/decrees) eventually becomes oppressive ("like a dragon").
*   **Historical Identification:** The provided text identifies this symbol as the United States of America—a nation rising in a "new world" with lamb-like principles of liberty, which prophecy indicates will eventually enforce the dogmas of the first beast.

Question: How will this second power enforce the will of the first?

Biblical Answer: “And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark...” (Revelation 13:16, 17)

Explanation: The "image of the beast" represents a union of church and state power, similar to the first beast. Economic sanctions (unable to buy or sell) will be used to pressure people into false worship.

Term Definition: **Forehead vs. Hand**:
*   **Forehead:** Represents the mind, intellect, and decision (belief).
*   **Hand:** Represents actions and labor (forced compliance).
God accepts only free-will service (the mind); the beast accepts forced compliance (the hand).

Question: Amidst this pressure, how does God identify His faithful people?

Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints; here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

Explanation: While the world follows the beast, God’s "remnant" (the final group of believers) is identified by two specific traits:
1.  They hold the **faith of Jesus**.
2.  They keep the **commandments of God**.

[ILL] Imagine a lighthouse in a storm. The waves (the beast's pressure) crash all around, but the lighthouse (the saints) stands firm on the rock. The "light" they shine is their obedience to God's law and their faith in Jesus.

Question: What constitutes the "Commandments of God"?

Biblical Answer: “And He declared unto you His covenant... even ten commandments; and He wrote them upon two tables of stone... and He added no more.” (Deuteronomy 4:13; 5:22)

Explanation: The Ten Commandments are the unchangeable standard of God's government. God "added no more," implying they are complete and not to be altered by human tradition or church councils.

Question: Is it acceptable to keep *most* of God's law but ignore part of it?

Biblical Answer: “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.” (James 2:10, 11)

Explanation: The Law is a unity, like a chain. Breaking one link breaks the chain. The controversy in the last days will center on loyalty to God's specific commands versus human traditions enforced by the beast.

Deeper Insight: The text suggests that the mark of the beast is received by those who bow to human authority in religious matters, while the "seal" of God belongs to those who remain loyal to His specific commandments, even under persecution (Rev 12:17).

Practical Application:
The Third Angel's Message is not just about frightening beasts; it is a call to loyalty.
*   **Check your compass:** Is your life guided by popular opinion (the world) or the Word of God?
*   **The True Test:** Are we willing to follow God's commandments even when it is socially or economically difficult?
*   **The Hope:** God promises that those who keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus will have the "patience" to endure until the end.
