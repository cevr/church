Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Honor thy father and thy mother.” (Exodus 20:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Moses holding the stone tablets, with soft light highlighting the text of the commandments.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: This command is the fifth of the Ten Commandments and the first regarding human relationships. To "honor" means to value highly, to respect, and to treat with dignity. It is the foundation of order in the home and society.

Slide 4 Word Study: What does "Honor" really mean?

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "honor" is *kabed*, which literally means "to be heavy" or "weighty." In biblical culture, to honor someone meant to treat them as a person of great substance and significance, never lightly or casually.

Slide 5 Question: How are parents instructed to teach God’s ways to their children?

---

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.” (Deut. 6:6, 7)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Religious education is not limited to the Sabbath; it is a continuous, daily lifestyle. Parents are to weave the knowledge of God into the ordinary activities of life—sitting, walking, resting, and rising.

Slide 8 Illustration: The Garden of Character

[ILL] Just as a garden requires constant tending—watering, weeding, and sunlight—rather than a single massive flood of water once a year, a child's character is formed by the constant, gentle influence of godly instruction every day.

Slide 9 Question: What is the purpose and promise of training a child correctly?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” (Prov. 22:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an older man looking back down a long road, reflecting on his journey.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The word "train" implies initiation or dedication. It suggests guiding a child into a habit or course of life. The promise is that the foundation laid in youth possesses a staying power that affects the entire life trajectory.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the life of Abraham. Genesis 18:19 records that God chose Abraham specifically because He knew Abraham would "command his children and his household after him" to keep the way of the Lord.

Slide 12 Question: How does Scripture describe the necessity of correction and discipline?

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “The rod and reproof give wisdom; but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.” (Prov. 29:15); “He that spareth his rod hateth his son, but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.” (Prov. 13:24)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a concerned father sitting with his son, speaking with a serious but loving expression.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: The Bible contrasts the world’s view with God’s view. Scripture identifies the withholding of discipline as a lack of love. True love desires the eternal salvation of the child more than their temporary comfort.

Term Definition: "Betimes" means "early" or "diligently." It implies correcting a habit before it becomes hardened.

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: The Parent as Watchman

Deeper Insight: Proverbs 23:14 mentions that correction "shalt deliver his soul from hell" (Sheol). This elevates parenting from mere behavior management to soul-winning. The parent acts as a watchman, guarding the child from paths that lead to spiritual death.

Slide 16 Question: What balance must fathers maintain while administering discipline?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father embracing a child who looks relieved and comforted.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.” (Col. 3:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a father kneeling down to be at eye level with his child, speaking gently.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: Authority must never be exercised with tyranny or passion. If discipline is unjust, inconsistent, or done in anger, it breaks the child’s spirit. The goal is restoration and obedience, not crushing the will.

[ILL] Think of a stringed instrument. If the string is too loose, it produces no music. If it is wound too tight (severity), it snaps. The godly parent seeks the perfect tension to produce a beautiful character.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a musician carefully tuning a harp or lyre, focused on the tension of the strings.

---

Slide 19 Question: How does the Bible link the state of the family to the "last days"?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dark, stormy sky over a landscape, with a single home with a light in the window standing firm.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “For men shall be lovers of their own selves... disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy.” (2 Tim. 3:2)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting depicting a chaotic marketplace scene where younger figures are visibly disrespecting elders, symbolizing societal breakdown.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: One of the signs of the peril of the last days is the breakdown of the home, specifically characterized by disobedience to parents. When the authority of the parent is rejected, the authority of God is soon rejected as well.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Malachi 4:6 predicts a message to "turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers." Restoring family religion is key to preparing for the Second Coming.

Slide 22 Question: Does the duty to honor parents end when we grow up?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a middle-aged man supporting an elderly man with a white beard as they walk.

---

Slide 23 Biblical Answer: “Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.” (Prov. 23:22); “Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man...” (Lev. 19:32)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a gathering where younger men are standing out of respect as an elder enters the room.

---

Slide 24 Explanation: Respect for authority creates a culture of reverence. We are to honor our parents even in their old age. This reverence is linked directly to the fear of God ("fear thy God; I am the Lord").

Slide 25 Practical Application

• **For Parents:** Are we "training" (guiding habits) or just "managing"? Are we teaching diligently?
• **For Children:** Do we treat our parents with "weight" and significance?
• **For All:** Do we show reverence to the aged, recognizing that in doing so, we honor the Ancient of Days?
