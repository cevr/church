Study Title: The Sacred Scriptures: God’s Written Word

Question: In the days of Jesus, what was the Bible called?

Biblical Answer: “Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?” (Matthew 21:42)

Explanation: The Bible refers to itself as the “Scriptures” (meaning *writings*) or the “Word of God” (Luke 8:21). These are not merely human literary works but are distinct and holy writings set apart for God’s people.

[DYK] The word "Bible" does not actually occur in the text itself. It comes from the Greek word *biblia*, meaning "little books." This is derived from *byblos* (papyrus), the material used for ancient writing, named after the Phoenician port of Byblos from where the Greeks obtained it.

Question: How did we receive these writings? Did they originate from human ideas?

Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21)

Explanation: The Bible is not a product of human will or invention. While humans held the pen, the Holy Spirit provided the thoughts. As Hebrews 1:1 states, it is God who spoke "by the prophets."

Term Definition: **Inspiration** (from 2 Timothy 3:16, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God") literally means "God-breathed." God breathed His truth into the minds of chosen men.

[ILL] Consider a captain steering a ship. The captain (the Holy Spirit) determines the course and the destination, but the helmsman (the human writer) physically turns the wheel. The personality of the writer is preserved, but the direction is entirely God's.

Question: What specific benefits does the Bible offer the reader?

Biblical Answer: “All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” (2 Timothy 3:16)

Explanation: The Scriptures are practical. They provide:
1.  **Doctrine**: Teaching us what is true.
2.  **Reproof**: Showing us where we are wrong.
3.  **Correction**: Showing us how to get right.
4.  **Instruction**: Teaching us how to stay right.

Deeper Insight: The goal of this instruction is found in verse 17: “That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” God gives us the Bible to equip us completely for a life of service and holiness.

Question: How did Jesus view the authority of the Old Testament Scriptures?

Biblical Answer: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, He expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)

Explanation: Jesus accepted the authority of the writings available in His day (the Old Testament) and used them to prove His identity as the Messiah. He divided them into three recognized sections: "the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms" (Luke 24:44).

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: It is profound to note that the "Law of Moses" (the Pentateuch), "the Prophets" (including historical books like Kings), and "the Psalms" (the Writings) comprised the entire Hebrew canon. By citing them, Jesus validated the history, the prophecies, and the songs of Israel as a unified testimony pointing to Himself. If the Master trusted the Scriptures, His followers must do likewise.

Question: Can we trust the content of the Bible?

Biblical Answer: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17)

Explanation: God is a "God of truth" (Deuteronomy 32:4). Because His character is perfect and He cannot lie, His Word is the standard of absolute truth.

[DYK] The Bible contains sixty-six books written by thirty-five to forty different men over a period of fifteen hundred years. Despite this vast span of time and diversity of authors (kings, fishermen, shepherds, doctors), the Bible maintains a unified message of redemption, proving one Divine Author guided the process.

Question: How highly does God value His Word?

Biblical Answer: “Thou has magnified Thy word above all Thy name.” (Psalm 138:2)

Explanation: A person's "name" represents their reputation and character. God has placed His written Word as the highest representation of His character. It is the bond of His integrity. If His Word fails, His character fails. Therefore, as Isaiah says, "the word of our God shall stand for ever" (Isaiah 40:8).

Practical Application: How should we treat this Book?
• **As a Lamp:** Use it to guide daily decisions (Psalm 119:105).
• **As Food:** Esteem it more than "necessary food" (Job 23:12).
• **As Hope:** Find patience and comfort in its pages (Romans 15:4).

[SN] Thought for meditation: We often seek God through feelings or circumstances, but He has chosen to reveal Himself primarily through His Word. To hear God speak, we must open the Scriptures.
