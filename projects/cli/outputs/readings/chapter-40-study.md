Study Title: The Sure Word of Prophecy

Question: What is the source and purpose of the Holy Scriptures?

Biblical Answer: “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.” (2 Timothy 3:16, 17)

Explanation: The Bible is not merely the product of human genius. "Inspiration" literally means "God-breathed." God communicated His mind to humanity to equip us for a righteous life. It is the manual that furnishes us for every good work.

[DYK] The word "Scripture" (graphe) simply means "writing," but in the New Testament, it is used exclusively to refer to the sacred, authoritative writings of the Old Testament and later the New Testament.

Question: Did the prophecies of the Bible originate from the prophets' own ideas?

Biblical Answer: “For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.” (2 Peter 1:21)

Explanation: No biblical prophecy was an invention or "private interpretation" (personal impulse) of the human writer. The Holy Spirit moved upon them, guiding their thoughts and words to convey God's message, not their own.

[ILL] Think of a sailing ship. The ship (the prophet) has a unique shape and captain, but it cannot move effectively without the wind (the Holy Spirit). The Spirit fills the sails and drives the vessel in the direction God intends.

Term Definition: “Moved” in Greek (*phero*) implies being carried along or borne up. It suggests that the prophets were carried by a power outside themselves.

Question: Who was the active agent inspiring the Old Testament prophets?

Biblical Answer: “...the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.” (1 Peter 1:11)

Explanation: It is a profound truth that the Spirit of Christ was active before His incarnation. The prophets were guided by the Spirit of Jesus to write about the coming Messiah. The entire Bible, from Genesis to Revelation, centers on Him.

Question: How reliable is the prophetic Word compared to personal experiences?

Biblical Answer: “We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn...” (2 Peter 1:19)

Explanation: The Apostle Peter had witnessed the majesty of Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration with his own eyes. Yet, he declares the written prophecies to be "more sure" than even his own vision. Our faith stands on the solid rock of Scripture, not on fleeting feelings or senses.

[SN] Spirit-led expansion: • This text establishes the Protestant principle of *Sola Scriptura*. Experiences, miracles, and feelings must always be tested by the "more sure" standard of the written Word. • The imagery of the "day star" (Phosphoros) refers to the planet Venus, the morning star that heralds the sunrise—symbolizing Christ's return.

Question: Are we permitted to understand the prophecies, specifically the book of Revelation?

Biblical Answer: “The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him... Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein.” (Revelation 1:1, 3)

Explanation: Far from being a sealed book that is impossible to understand, it is called a "Revelation" (an unveiling). A specific blessing is pronounced upon those who read, hear, and keep its truths.

[DYK] The Greek word for Revelation is *Apokalypsis*, which means "uncovering" or "disclosure." It is not meant to confuse, but to reveal Jesus Christ in His glory.

Question: What about the prophecies of Daniel? Were they always meant to be fully understood?

Biblical Answer: “But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.” (Daniel 12:4)

Explanation: While Revelation is an open book, portions of Daniel were "sealed" until a specific period called "the time of the end." Jesus Himself pointed back to Daniel (Matthew 24:15), indicating that in the last days, the study of these prophecies would lead to an increase in knowledge.

Deeper Insight: The "running to and fro" is often interpreted in two ways that harmonize: 1) The literal increase in travel and science in the last days, and 2) The diligent searching back and forth through the Scriptures to understand the time prophecies as the end approaches.

Question: To whom do the truths of the Bible belong?

Biblical Answer: “The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever.” (Deuteronomy 29:29)

Explanation: God in His infinite wisdom retains some mysteries, but everything He has revealed in Scripture is our property. It is a heritage given to us and our children to study, cherish, and obey.

Practical Application:
Since we have a "sure word of prophecy," how should we treat the Bible today?
• We should read it with confidence, knowing it is God-breathed.
• We should trust it more than our emotions.
• We should study the prophecies to know where we are in history ("the time of the end").
• We should claim the blessing promised to those who read and keep God's Word.
