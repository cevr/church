Slide 2 Question: For what specific purpose did God create the earth?

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God Himself that formed the earth and made it... He created it not in vain, He formed it to be inhabited.” (Isaiah 45:18)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a pristine ancient valley, empty but prepared, waiting for inhabitants, bathed in morning light.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: God does nothing without purpose. The earth was not designed to be a wasteland or a place of suffering; it was meticulously crafted to be a home for His children.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for "in vain" here is *tohu*, the same word used in Genesis 1:2 ("without form"). God did not create the earth to remain chaotic; He formed it specifically to sustain life and relationship.

Slide 5 Question: Who was originally given authority (dominion) over the earth?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam standing in the Garden of Eden, looking out over the creation with a sense of noble responsibility.

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou has put all things under His feet.” (Psalm 8:6; see also Genesis 1:26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Adam surrounded by animals (lions, sheep, deer) resting peacefully near him, symbolizing harmony and authority.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: At Creation, Adam was appointed as the steward and ruler of the world. He was to govern the earth in harmony with God’s will.

Slide 8 Question: Does humanity currently possess this full dominion?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a stormy landscape, shadows casting over a once-beautiful field, representing a broken world.

---

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “But now we see not yet all things put under him.” (Hebrews 2:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a person looking out over a ruined city or a field of thorns, expression sorrowful, soft lighting highlighting the loss.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: While humanity was designed to rule, we clearly do not control the chaos, death, and suffering in the world today. The dominion was lost.

---

Slide 11 Question: How was this dominion lost, and who holds it now?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Tree of Knowledge in the distance, shadows lengthening across the garden floor.

Slide 12 Biblical Answer: “For of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.” (2 Peter 2:19)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of chains lying open on the ground, symbolizing the voluntary surrender of freedom.

---

Slide 13 The Transfer of Authority: When Adam yielded to Satan’s temptation in Eden, he surrendered his allegiance—and consequently his dominion—to the adversary.

[ILL] Imagine a king who voluntarily hands over the keys of his kingdom to an invader. Though the king (Adam) was the legal ruler, the invader (Satan) became the "de facto" ruler by conquest.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a king reluctantly handing a golden key to a shadowed figure, soft dramatic lighting.

Slide 14 Question: How do we know Satan currently claims possession of the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus standing on a high mountain, looking out over the kingdoms of the world below.

---

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “And the Devil said unto Him [Jesus], All this power will I give Thee, and the glory of them; for that is delivered unto Me; and to whomsoever I will, I give it.” (Luke 4:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the temptation in the wilderness, a shadowed figure gesturing toward the horizon, Jesus standing firm in the light.

---

Slide 16 Insight: This occurred during the temptation in the wilderness. The text notes that this glory was "delivered" to Satan—surrendered by Adam.

[SN] It is significant that Jesus did not dispute Satan's claim to be the "prince of this world" at that moment. Jesus came not to dispute the claim with words, but to reconquer the territory through His sacrifice.

Slide 17 Question: Will the "first dominion" ever be restored?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a shepherd watching over a flock at sunrise, looking toward a fortified tower in the distance.

---

Slide 18 Biblical Answer: “And thou, O tower of the flock... unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion...” (Micah 4:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of an ancient watchtower standing strong amidst a peaceful pasture, golden light breaking through clouds.

---

Slide 19 Explanation: The "first dominion" refers to the rule Adam lost in Eden. The prophecy promises its return to the "tower of the flock," a title for the Messiah.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a crown being lifted up, restored to its rightful place, soft radiance surrounding it.

Slide 20 Definition: The Meek
In Matthew 5:5, Jesus says, "Blessed are the meek; for they shall inherit the earth."

The inheritance is not for the aggressive or the proud who conquer by force, but for those who wait upon the Lord (Psalm 37:34).

Slide 21 Question: Who is the true heir of the promise made to Abraham regarding the world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Abraham looking up at the starry night sky, contemplating the promise of God.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.” (Galatians 3:16)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single bright star shining more intensely than the others, illuminating a desert landscape.

Slide 23 Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **The Promise:** Abraham was promised the world (Romans 4:13).
2.  **The Reality:** Abraham died without owning a foot of it (Acts 7:5).
3.  **The Hope:** He looked for a city built by God (Hebrews 11:10).

---

Slide 24 The Solution: Christ is the true Seed. If we belong to Christ, we become heirs of this promise (Galatians 3:29).

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ extending a hand of welcome to a diverse group of believers.

Slide 25 Question: Before the righteous inherit the earth, what must happen to the current world?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a landscape undergoing transformation, old structures fading away.

---

Slide 26 Biblical Answer: “The heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a purifying fire sweeping across a landscape, not destructive but cleansing, removing dross and thorns.

---

Slide 27 Explanation: Fire will purify the earth of the curse of sin. It is a cleansing process to prepare for renovation.

Slide 28 Question: What follows this purification?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of smoke clearing to reveal a vibrant, green landscape, bathed in fresh morning light.

---

Slide 29 Biblical Answer: “Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.” (2 Peter 3:13; see also Isaiah 65:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a renewed earth, rivers crystal clear, trees bearing fruit, a sense of absolute purity.

---

Slide 30 Deeper Insight: The "New Earth" is not a disembodied spiritual cloud-land. It is this earth, restored to its Edenic perfection. The home of the saved will be a tangible, physical reality where righteousness dwells.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of people walking on solid ground, touching flowers, and building homes, emphasizing physical reality.

Slide 31 Question: What will life look like in the New Earth?

Slide 32 Biblical Answer: “The wolf and the lamb shall feed together... They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain.” (Isaiah 65:25)

“And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs... and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” (Isaiah 35:10)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a wolf and a lamb lying down together, a child playing nearby, soft golden light.

---

Slide 33 Note on Restoration:
In Eden, sin brought fear between man and beast, and sorrow to the heart.

In the New Earth, nature is at peace, and the heart is at peace. It is Eden restored, but more glorious because God dwells visibly with His people.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a joyous procession approaching a glowing city, faces radiant with happiness.

---

Slide 34 Practical Application:
*   **Patience:** Like Abraham, we are "sojourners" here.
*   **Identity:** Our inheritance is tied to Christ.
*   **Hope:** The chaos is temporary. The rightful King is coming to restore the dominion.
