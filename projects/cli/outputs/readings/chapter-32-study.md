Study Title: Regeneration: New Life and a New Earth

Question: What was the primary mission of Jesus Christ when He came to this earth?

Biblical Answer: “For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:10)

Explanation: Jesus did not come merely to teach or to judge, but to rescue. Humanity had wandered away from its original purpose and relationship with God. Christ’s mission was a recovery operation to restore what was lost.

[DYK] The title "Son of Man" was Jesus' favorite way to refer to Himself. It emphasizes His connection to humanity and His role as our Representative and Kinsman-Redeemer.

Question: Since we cannot earn our salvation, how do we become part of God's family?

Biblical Answer: “For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:26)

Explanation: Entrance into God's family is not based on heritage or personal achievement, but on trust (faith) in what Jesus has done.

Term Definition: “Faith” in the biblical sense is not merely intellectual agreement. It is an active trust—a transaction where we give our sinful lives to Christ and accept His righteous life in return.

Question: How does the Bible describe the spiritual change that happens inside a believer?

Biblical Answer: “According to His mercy He saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” (Titus 3:5)

Explanation: The Bible calls this "regeneration." Because we were spiritually "dead" in our sins (Ephesians 2:5), we needed more than improvement; we needed a resurrection. The Holy Spirit washes the mind and creates a new spiritual life within us.

[ILL] A dirty mirror cannot wash itself. It needs an outside agent to clean it. Similarly, the law acts as a mirror to show us the "dirt" of our sin (Romans 3:20), but only the "washing of regeneration" through the Holy Spirit can actually cleanse us.

Question: If we are saved by faith, does it matter how we live?

Biblical Answer: “For as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.” (James 2:26)

Progressive Disclosure: • Faith is the root • Obedience is the fruit • A living connection with God naturally produces a change in behavior.

Explanation: While we are not justified *by* the deeds of the law (Romans 3:20), a true, living faith results in a life that pleases God. As 1 John 3:14 notes, a clear evidence of this new life is that we "love the brethren."

[SN] Early Adventists often emphasized the harmony of the Law and the Gospel. They taught that while the Law condemns the sinner, the Gospel regenerates the sinner so they can walk in harmony with the Law again. It is not legalism to obey; it is the natural pulse of a new heart.

Question: The Bible speaks of "regeneration" for people, but what about the earth itself?

Biblical Answer: “And Jesus said unto them... That ye which have followed Me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones...” (Matthew 19:28)

Explanation: Jesus uses the word "regeneration" to describe the future renewal of the world. Just as individuals must be born again, the earth itself must be cleansed from the curse of sin and restored.

Deeper Insight: In Luke 4:5-6, Satan claimed to possess the kingdoms of the world. Adam lost his dominion to Satan through sin. However, Ephesians 1:14 speaks of the "redemption of the purchased possession." Christ’s blood bought back not only the sinner but the sinner's home—the earth.

Question: What will be the final result of this cosmic regeneration?

Biblical Answer: “And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and His servants shall serve Him.” (Revelation 22:3)

Explanation: The history of salvation ends where it began—in a garden, but better. The curse placed on the ground in Genesis 3 is fully reversed.

[SN] Tangent on the "Tree of Life": In Genesis 3:24, humanity was barred from the Tree of Life to prevent sinners from living forever in misery. In Revelation 22:14, the "right to the tree of life" is restored to those who have been washed by the blood of the Lamb and walk in His commandments. The story of Scripture is a complete circle of restoration.

Practical Application: Regeneration is both a present reality and a future hope. • We experience the "renewing of the Holy Ghost" today in our hearts. • We look forward to the physical renewal of the earth at Jesus' coming. Are you allowing the Holy Spirit to regenerate your heart today, preparing you for that new world?
