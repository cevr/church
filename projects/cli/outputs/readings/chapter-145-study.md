Study Title: Praise and Thanksgiving: The Language of Faith

Question: For what purpose were humanity and all things created?

Biblical Answer: “Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.” (Revelation 4:11)

Explanation: We are not the product of chance. We were designed by God, for God. Our existence is intended to bring Him joy and reflect His character. However, Scripture reveals that in our natural state, we have failed this design: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).

[DYK] The word "pleasure" in this text does not mean God uses us for mere entertainment. It speaks of His *will* and *desire*. Just as an artist finds pleasure in a masterpiece that reflects their vision, God desires to see His love reflected in us.

Question: Since we have fallen short, what motivates us to return to God?

Biblical Answer: “Or despisest thou the riches of His goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?” (Romans 2:4)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Not Fear:** It is not the threat of punishment that genuinely changes the heart.
2.  **Goodness:** It is the kindness and patience of God that melts the heart.
3.  **Repentance:** This leads to a change of mind and direction.

[ILL] Think of a block of ice. You can hammer it, and it will only shatter into smaller pieces of ice. But if you place it in the warm sunlight, it melts and changes form effortlessly. The law may hammer the conscience, but only the warmth of God's love (His goodness) melts the heart into repentance.

Question: How often should we give thanks, and does this include difficult times?

Biblical Answer: “Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Ephesians 5:20)

Explanation: This is one of the most challenging commands in Scripture. We are told to give thanks "always" and for "all things." This is only possible because we have the assurance of Romans 8:28—that “all things work together for good to them that love God.” We do not thank God *for* the pain, but we thank Him that He is sovereign *over* the pain and can produce good from it.

Term Definition: **"Sacrifice of Praise"** (derived from Heb 13:15 and Ps 50:23). Praise is often easy when life is good. When life is hard, praise becomes a "sacrifice"—something that costs us effort but is highly valued by God.

[SN] **Spirit-Led Insight:** Consider the story of Paul and Silas in Acts 16. They were beaten, bleeding, and in a dungeon. Yet, "at midnight" they sang praises. The result was an earthquake and deliverance. Ellen White and the pioneers often emphasized that talking of darkness brings darkness, but talking of faith brings light. Praise is a spiritual weapon that shakes the foundations of the enemy’s prison.

Question: How does our praise affect those around us?

Biblical Answer: “My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.” (Psalm 34:2)

Explanation: Faith is personal, but it is not private. When we declare what God has done for us, it encourages others who are struggling. The "humble"—those who are hurting or seeking God—gain hope when they hear our testimony.

[DYK] In the ancient Hebrew sanctuary service, many offerings were communal. When a person offered a "thank offering," it was shared with others. Your gratitude feeds the faith of your neighbor.

Question: What is the danger of an unthankful heart?

Biblical Answer: “Because that, when they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.” (Romans 1:21)

Explanation: Ingratitude is not merely bad manners; it is the first step toward spiritual darkness. When we stop acknowledging God as the source of our blessings, we begin to trust in ourselves ("vain imaginations"). This leads to a darkened mind that can no longer perceive truth.

[ILL] Imagine a diver whose air hose is connected to a ship on the surface. If the diver decides he no longer needs to acknowledge the ship, and cuts the line, he is lost. Thanksgiving is the "air hose" that keeps us connected to the Source of life.

Question: What happens when we combine prayer with thanksgiving?

Biblical Answer: “Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” (Philippians 4:6)

Deeper Insight: Anxiety ("being careful") and Thanksgiving cannot occupy the same space in the mind. The antidote to anxiety is not just asking God for help (supplication), but asking with a memory of what He has already done (thanksgiving).

[SN] **Historical Note:** In 2 Chronicles 20, King Jehoshaphat sent a choir out *before* the army. They did not sing a song of request; they sang a song of thanks ("Praise the Lord; for his mercy endureth for ever"). The victory was won not by fighting, but by praising. This illustrates the Advent belief that in the final conflict, our trust in God's word is our only defense.

Practical Application:
*   **In Prayer:** Before asking for new blessings, spend the first few minutes thanking God for specific past answers.
*   **In Public:** Share a testimony this week with a "humble" person who needs encouragement.
*   **In Trial:** If you are facing a "midnight" situation like Paul and Silas, try singing or reading a Psalm of praise, and watch how the atmosphere changes.
