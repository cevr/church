Study Title: The Great Salvation: A Journey with Jesus

Question: For what specific purpose did Jesus Christ come into the world?

Biblical Answer: “This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.” (1 Timothy 1:15)

Explanation: The primary mission of Jesus was a rescue mission. He did not come merely to teach a moral code or set a good example, but to intervene in a desperate situation—saving humanity from the condition of sin.

[DYK] The name "Jesus" (Yeshua in Hebrew) literally means "The Lord Saves" or "Salvation." His very name describes His mission.

Question: What exactly does Jesus save us *from*?

Biblical Answer: “Thou shalt call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their sins.” (Matthew 1:21)

Explanation: This is a vital distinction. He does not just save us from the *penalty* of sin (death), but from the sin itself. Salvation is a process of being delivered from the power and practice of sinning, restoring us to a relationship with God.

[ILL] Imagine a doctor who pays a sick patient's hospital bill but leaves the patient dying of the disease. That is not a complete cure. Jesus pays the debt (forgiveness) *and* provides the cure (healing the heart from sin).

Question: Is salvation found in anyone else, or any other philosophy?

Biblical Answer: “Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)

Term Definition: **"Salvation"** (Greek: *sōtēria*) implies deliverance, preservation, safety, and healing. It is holistic—covering the soul, the mind, and ultimately the body at the resurrection.

Question: Is salvation a one-time event that cannot be forfeited, or does it require perseverance?

Biblical Answer: “But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.” (Matthew 24:13)

Explanation: The Bible describes salvation as a relationship that must be maintained. Just as a marriage requires ongoing faithfulness, our relationship with Christ requires "enduring to the end."

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The source text references the parable of the unmerciful servant (Matt 18). In that story, a servant was fully forgiven a massive debt. However, when he refused to show mercy to others, his debt was reinstated. This teaches that God’s grace is transformative; if we accept His forgiveness but refuse to let it change our character, we step out of His salvation. See Ezekiel 18:24.

Question: Since we must endure, when is our salvation fully realized?

Biblical Answer: “And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.” (Romans 13:11)

Progressive Disclosure:
1.  **Justification**: We are saved from the *penalty* of sin (Past/Present).
2.  **Sanctification**: We are being saved from the *power* of sin (Present process).
3.  **Glorification**: We will be saved from the *presence* of sin (Future event).

Deeper Insight: The Apostle Peter writes that we are "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time" (1 Peter 1:5). While we have the assurance of acceptance now, the full reality of rescue—eternal life in a sinless world—occurs at the Second Coming of Jesus (Hebrews 9:28).

Question: How do we obtain this life right now?

Biblical Answer: “He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.” (1 John 5:12)

Explanation: Eternal life is not a commodity God hands us separate from Himself. Eternal life is found *in* a Person. If you have Jesus—through faith, surrender, and an indwelling Spirit—you have the life.

[ILL] If you have a seed, you have the entire future tree within your hand, even if it hasn't grown yet. In the same way, if you have Christ (the Seed), you possess eternal life now, which will fully bloom in the resurrection.

Question: Was this plan of salvation an afterthought, or was it planned long ago?

Biblical Answer: “...the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.” (Revelation 13:8)

Explanation: Before the first sin was ever committed, God had a plan to save humanity through the sacrifice of His Son. It was not a "Plan B," but an eternal purpose of love.

Practical Application: Since salvation is a daily walk of "enduring" and "having the Son," ask yourself today:
*   Am I harboring unforgiveness like the unmerciful servant?
*   Am I letting Jesus save me *from* my sins today, or just asking for coverage while I keep sinning?
*   Do I have the assurance that comes from "having the Son"?

God invites you to take the "water of life freely" (Rev 22:17) and begin the journey today.
