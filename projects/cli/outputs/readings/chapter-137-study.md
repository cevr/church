Study Title: True Hospitality: Opening the Heart and Home

Question: What is the true biblical definition of hospitality?

Biblical Answer: “Love worketh no ill to his neighbor; therefore love is fulfilling of the law.” (Rom. 13:10)

Explanation: While dictionaries define hospitality as the reception of guests without expectation of reward, Scripture deepens this definition. It identifies hospitality not merely as a social custom, but as an active expression of love and charity. It is the practical fulfillment of the commandment to "love thy neighbor as thyself."

Term Definition: "Charity" in the biblical sense is not merely giving money; it is supreme, self-sacrificing love that seeks the good of others.

[DYK] In the ancient Near East, hospitality was crucial for survival. There were no hotels or restaurants in the desert; refusing hospitality could mean death for a traveler. God reminds Israel that they were once strangers in Egypt, and thus must love the stranger (Deut 10:19).

Question: Is hospitality an optional trait for the believer?

Biblical Answer: “Be not forgetful to entertain strangers.” (Heb. 13:2); “Use hospitality one to another.” (1 Peter 4:9)

Explanation: It is commanded as a duty for all believers. It is so essential to Christian character that even church leaders and ministers are specifically required to be "given to hospitality" (1 Tim. 3:2).

[SN] For the early Advent believers and pioneers, hospitality was a necessity of the "traveling ministry." Preachers stayed in the homes of members, binding the flock together. This duty creates a network of care within the body of Christ.

Question: To whom should we show this kindness?

Biblical Answer: “As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.” (Gal. 6:10)

Progressive Disclosure:
• Fellow Believers
• Strangers (Lev. 19:34)
• The Poor (James 2:1-4)
• Enemies (Rom. 12:20)

Explanation: We are warned against showing partiality—favoring the rich man with the "gold ring" while neglecting the poor man in "vile raiment." True hospitality is blind to social status. We are even called to feed our enemy if he hungers, which acts as "coals of fire" on his head—melting his hardness with kindness.

[ILL] Imagine a doctor who only treats healthy people. Hospitality that is only extended to friends who can repay the favor is like that doctor. True biblical hospitality is a hospital for the soul, open to those who cannot pay us back.

Question: What spirit or attitude should accompany our hospitality?

Biblical Answer: “Use hospitality one to another without grudging.” (1 Peter 4:9)

Explanation: The action of opening one's home must be matched by the condition of one's heart. If we give food or shelter with resentment, or without charity, "it profiteth me nothing" (1 Cor. 13:3). It must be done faithfully and generously.

Question: Who are we actually welcoming when we serve others?

Biblical Answer: “In as much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me.” (Matt. 25:40)

Deeper Insight: Jesus identifies Himself intimately with the suffering, the stranger, and the needy. When we open our doors to the unfortunate, we are physically serving a human, but spiritually serving the Messiah.

[SN] Tangent on Prophetic Reward: The text mentions that receiving a prophet yields a "prophet's reward" (Matt 10:41). This suggests that by physically sustaining those who carry God's message, the host shares in the spiritual fruit of that messenger's labor.

Question: What biblical example sets the standard for hospitality?

Biblical Answer: “...and when he [Abraham] saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door... And Abraham hastened into the tent... make ready quickly... and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.” (Selected from Gen. 18:2-8)

Explanation: Abraham did not wait for the guests to beg; he "ran" to meet them. He served them personally, washing their feet and standing by while they ate. His service was prompt, generous (the best calf), and humble.

Question: Does the giver lose anything by being generous?

Biblical Answer: “He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.” (Prov. 19:17)

Explanation: While the definition of hospitality involves expecting no reward from the *guest*, God promises that the *host* will not lack. The Bible promises that if we give, it will be given to us "good measure, pressed down... and running over" (Luke 6:38).

Practical Application: How can we practice this today?
• Invite someone new at church to lunch.
• Offer assistance to a neighbor without being asked.
• Avoid "grudging" when our schedule is interrupted by someone in need.
• Remember that our home is a stewardship from God, to be used for His glory.
