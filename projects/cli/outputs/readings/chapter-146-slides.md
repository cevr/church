Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “For the Son of man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.” (Mark 13:34)

Slide 3 Explanation: The Scripture compares Jesus to a master who has traveled to heaven, leaving the church in our care. Notice the specificity: He gives “every man his work.”

---

Slide 4 Insight: In God's plan, there are no spectators. Every believer has a specific role to play and the authority to act within that role.

[DYK] In the ancient Roman world, stewards often managed entire estates. They were trusted administrators with significant autonomy to make decisions while the master was away.

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “And unto one He gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability...” (Matthew 25:15)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master giving bags of silver to three different men standing in a line, historically respectful.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: God is just and practical. He distributes opportunities and resources based on our ability to handle them. He does not demand five-talent results from a one-talent person, only faithfulness.

Slide 8 Term Definition: “Talent” (Greek: *talanton*)

Initially a large unit of currency weighing approx. 75 lbs, the word evolved to mean natural skills. Spiritually, it represents every gift, resource, time, and influence God entrusts to us.

Slide 9 Question: What is the fatal mistake of the unfaithful servant?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth... His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant.” (Matthew 25:25-26)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man digging a hole in the dirt to bury a bag of money, deep shadows and earthy tones.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The servant did not steal the money; he simply did nothing with it. His excuse was fear. In the Christian life, negligence is as dangerous as open rebellion.

Slide 12 Illustration: Spiritual Atrophy

[ILL] Imagine a muscle in the human body. If you refuse to use it for fear of injury, it will atrophy and wither. Spiritual gifts act the same way—they must be used to grow.

Slide 13 Question: What is the reward for those who faithfully use their talents?

Slide 14 Biblical Answer: “Well done, thou good and faithful servant... enter thou into the joy of thy lord.” (Matthew 25:21)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a master placing a hand on a servant's shoulder with a warm, welcoming smile.

---

Slide 15 Question: What exactly is this "joy of the Lord" that we are invited to share?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus looking out over a multitude of people with an expression of deep love and longing.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: “Looking unto Jesus... who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross...” (Hebrews 12:2); “He shall see the travail of His soul, and shall be satisfied.” (Isaiah 53:11)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the crucifixion in the distance, but focused on a foreground light illuminating a redeemed family.

---

Slide 17 Deep Insight: The "joy" of the Master is the joy of seeing souls saved. When we work to save others, we partake in the very specific joy that sustains God Himself—the joy of redemption.

[SN] The phrase "travail of His soul" uses childbirth imagery. Just as a mother forgets labor pains for the joy of her child, Christ views His suffering as worth it when He looks upon the redeemed.

Slide 18 Question: What happens to those who claim to be Christians but produce no fruit?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vineyard with lush green leaves but no grapes visible.

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Every branch in Me that beareth not fruit He taketh away...” (John 15:2); “He that is not with Me is against Me: and he that gathereth not with Me scattereth.” (Luke 11:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a vinedresser pruning a grape vine, cutting away dead branches.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: Neutrality is impossible. A branch that consumes blessings but produces no service or souls fails its created purpose and is removed.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of cut branches lying on the ground, separated from the living vine.

---

Slide 21 Question: What is our true identity and motive in this work?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a messenger holding a royal scroll, standing before a foreign crowd.

---

Slide 22 Biblical Answer: “Now then we are ambassadors for Christ...” (2 Corinthians 5:20); “For the love of Christ constraineth us...” (2 Corinthians 5:14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Paul speaking earnestly to a group of people in a marketplace.

---

Slide 23 Explanation: We are "ambassadors"—official representatives on foreign soil speaking for the King. Our motive is the compelling love of Christ. Because He died for all, we live to tell all.

Slide 24 Practical Application

*   **Identify**: What specific "talent" (time, skill, money, influence) do you have right now?
*   **Action**: Are you using it to bless others, or hiding it?
*   **Motive**: Are you driven by fear, or by the joy of seeing others saved?

Slide 25 Prayer Thought

Lord, help us not to bury our opportunities in the earth of worldly cares. Let us be faithful ambassadors, that we may one day share in Your joy over souls redeemed.
