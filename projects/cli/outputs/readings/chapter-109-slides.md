Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7)

---

Slide 3 Explanation: The Creation Formula

Genesis 2:7 provides a clear equation for life:
**Dust of the Ground + Breath of Life = A Living Soul.**

The text does not say man *received* a soul; it says man *became* a soul.

Slide 4 Illustration: The Box Analogy

[ILL] Think of a wooden box. You take planks (dust) and nails (breath) and combine them to make a box (soul). If you pull the nails out and separate the planks, where does the "box" go? It ceases to exist. Without the breath of life from God, the "living soul" does not exist.

Slide 5 Definition: The Meaning of "Soul"

The word translated as "soul" is the Hebrew word **nephesh**.
Literal meaning: "A breathing creature."

Slide 6 Question: Is the term "soul" applied only to human beings?

Slide 7 Biblical Answer: “And levy a tribute unto the Lord... one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep.” (Numbers 31:28)

“And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea... and every living soul died in the sea.” (Revelation 16:3)

Slide 8 Explanation: Souls in the Animal Kingdom

Scripture applies the term "soul" to cattle, donkeys, sheep, and sea creatures. This confirms that "soul" refers to living, breathing life, rather than a distinct, immortal spirit entity reserved only for humans.

[DYK] In the King James Version, the Hebrew word *nephesh* is translated as "soul" 428 times, but it is also translated as "life" (119 times), "person" (29 times), and "beast" (2 times). This translation variety sometimes obscures the fact that animals and people are both described as "souls."

Slide 9 Question: Does a soul have physical needs and experiences?

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: The Needs of the Soul

*   **Thirst:** “As cold waters to a thirsty soul...” (Proverbs 25:25)
*   **Hunger:** “...an idle soul shall suffer hunger.” (Proverbs 19:15)
*   **Eating:** “But the soul that eateth of the flesh...” (Leviticus 7:20)
*   **Injury:** “And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword.” (Joshua 11:11)

Slide 11 Explanation: A Tangible Reality

These texts demonstrate that the soul is physical and tangible. It is not an immaterial ghost that floats free of the body; it is the person themselves who eats, drinks, and can be harmed.

Slide 12 Question: Is the soul immortal, or can it die?

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “Behold, all souls are Mine, as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.” (Ezekiel 18:4)

Slide 14 Explanation: Mortality

The Bible clearly states that souls are subject to death. Immortality is not inherent to humans; it is a gift God alone possesses (1 Timothy 6:16) and which the redeemed seek at the resurrection.

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: The Sacrifice of Jesus

Isaiah 53:12 says Jesus “poured out His soul unto death.”
This highlights the totality of His sacrifice—He gave His entire life and being for humanity.

[SN] Optional tangents for Spirit‑led expansion: • The word *Hades* in the New Testament (Acts 2:31) corresponds to *Sheol* in the Old Testament—simply meaning the grave or the realm of the dead, not a place of burning torment. • The theological implication that if the soul were naturally immortal, death would not be the "wages of sin" (Romans 6:23). • The comfort found in knowing that in death, the believer sleeps peacefully (unconscious) until the call of the Life-giver at the second coming.

Slide 16 Question: Where does the Bible say the soul goes at death?

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?” (Psalm 89:48)

“He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that His soul was not left in hell [hades], neither His flesh did see corruption.” (Acts 2:31)

Slide 18 Explanation & Hope

At death, the soul goes to the grave. Even Jesus' soul went to the grave. However, the glorious hope is that the soul is not left there. Just as Jesus was raised, so too will those who sleep in Him be raised.

Slide 19 Practical Application: Why This Matters

1.  **Value of Life:** We value our physical life and body as a creation of God.
2.  **Protection:** We are protected from spiritualistic deceptions regarding the dead.
3.  **Hope:** Our hope is placed entirely on the resurrection and the return of Jesus.
