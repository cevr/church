Study Title: God’s Special Promises for Children

Question: What is the first commandment that contains a specific promise?

Biblical Answer: “Honor thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise.” (Ephesians 6:2)

Explanation: The Ten Commandments define our duty to God and to man. The fifth commandment, regarding parents, acts as a bridge between the two. The Apostle Paul notes that this is the first command in the list that includes a specific incentive for keeping it.

Question: What is the specific promise connected with honoring our parents?

Biblical Answer: “Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” (Exodus 20:12)

[DYK] In the culture of the Bible, the family was the center of religious training and education. To honor one's parents was to respect the structure God established for passing down wisdom and faith.

Term Definition: “Honor” (Hebrew *kabad*) literally means to be heavy or weighty. To honor parents means to treat them with weight, significance, and high value, rather than treating them lightly or disrespectfully.

Question: What does God promise to teach children who listen (hearken) to Him?

Biblical Answer: “Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” (Psalm 34:11)

Question: What is the "fear of the Lord"?

Biblical Answer: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do His commandments.” (Psalm 111:10)

Explanation: Biblical "fear" in this context does not mean being terrified of God. It refers to a deep, reverential awe and respect. It is recognizing God as the supreme Authority. True wisdom begins when we acknowledge God's position and submit to His guidance through obedience.

[ILL] Think of a hiker on a steep mountain trail following an expert guide. The hiker has a healthy "fear" or respect for the guide's instructions, not because the guide is mean, but because the guide knows the safe path. Ignoring the guide is foolish; following him is wisdom.

Question: How does God view a young person who is wise, compared to a powerful leader who refuses to learn?

Biblical Answer: “Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.” (Ecclesiastes 4:13)

Deeper Insight: Wisdom in Scripture is not about age or status; it is about a teachable spirit ("admonished"). A child who listens to God is spiritually superior to a king who thinks he knows everything.

Question: How did Jesus demonstrate His feelings toward children?

Biblical Answer: “Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto Me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 19:14) AND “And He took them up in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them.” (Mark 10:16)

Term Definition: “Suffer” in older English means "to allow" or "to permit." The disciples tried to send the children away, thinking they were bothering the Master. Jesus corrected them, showing that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those with the humble, trusting heart of a child.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: This scene reveals the character of God. In ancient societies, children were often marginalized or seen as having low status. Jesus elevated them, showing that God’s love is not based on what we can produce or achieve, but on our willingness to come to Him.

Question: Since Jesus is in Heaven now, how can we receive His blessing today?

Biblical Answer: “And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.” (Matthew 21:22)

Explanation: We can no longer physically climb into Jesus' arms, but we access His presence through the medium of prayer. Faith ("believing") is the hand that reaches out to receive God's gifts.

Question: What is the ultimate promise for those who keep God’s commandments?

Biblical Answer: “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Revelation 22:14)

Progressive Disclosure: • Obedience leads to blessing • Access is restored to what was lost in Eden (the Tree of Life) • Entrance is granted into the New Jerusalem

Deeper Insight: This verse connects the end of the Bible with the beginning. In Genesis, humanity was barred from the Tree of Life because of disobedience (sin). In Revelation, humanity is restored to the Tree of Life through faith and obedience to God’s commandments. The law of God and the grace of God work together to restore His family.

[SN] Tangent on Pioneer Theology: Early Adventists emphasized that the "Commandments" in Revelation 22:14 are the standard of judgment and the evidence of a transformed heart. It is fitting that the last promise in the Bible concerns the keeping of God's law, ensuring an eternity of peace and order.

Practical Application: How can we claim these promises today? • Show respect to parents and elders • Cultivate a teachable spirit • Do not be afraid to come to Jesus in prayer, no matter your age • Value obedience to God’s law as the path to life.
