Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.” (Hebrews 1:8)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a majestic throne room, with a golden sceptre resting on a royal seat, illuminated by a heavenly beam of light.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: Here, the Father addresses the Son directly as "God." This establishes Christ’s supreme authority and eternal nature. He is not a subject in the kingdom; He holds the sceptre of the kingdom.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Christ seated in glory, holding a sceptre with a gentle but authoritative expression, surrounded by soft clouds.

---

Slide 4 Did You Know? The "sceptre" mentioned in Hebrews is a staff carried by a ruler as a symbol of sovereignty. In the hands of Christ, it is a sceptre of "righteousness" (or uprightness).

[DYK] His rule is based on perfect justice, unlike earthly kingdoms often built on force.

Slide 8 Insight: The Foundation of Salvation

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The pre-existence of Christ is the foundation of the plan of salvation. If He were a created being, He could not fully reveal the Father, nor could His life pay the infinite price for the sins of the whole world. Only the Creator can redeem the creation.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the ascension, Christ rising in glory while retaining His human form.

Slide 14 Term Definition: “Mystery of Godliness”

Slide 15 Illustration: The King in Disguise

[ILL] Consider a King who puts on the garments of a peasant to walk among his people, to understand their hardships and help them. Though he wears common clothes, he does not lose his royal identity or authority; he is simply veiling his glory to be approachable.

Slide 21 Explanation: Just as Christ prays for His disciples to be united, He illustrates that He and the Father are one in purpose, spirit, and work. They operate in perfect harmony for the salvation of man.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus washing the disciples' feet, symbolizing a unified purpose of service.

Slide 24 Deeper Insight: The Author of Creation

If Christ created "all things," He Himself cannot be a "thing" that was created. He stands outside of creation as its Author.

Slide 25 Question: What titles are given to Jesus that prove His divinity?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies, with Christ’s face superimposed gently over the priest.

Slide 36 Practical Application

Because Jesus is God, He has the power to help us. Because Jesus became man, He has the sympathy to understand us. We need not fear approaching Him; we can come "boldly" with our needs, knowing He is both our King and our Brother.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus placing a hand on the shoulder of a kneeling person, combining royal authority with brotherly love.
