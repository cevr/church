Study Title: The Resurrection of the Just

Question: What is the primary result of the fall of man, and what is his condition in the grave?

Biblical Answer: “Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.” (Romans 5:12)

“Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.” (Ecclesiastes 9:10)

Explanation: The Bible teaches that death is an intruder, not a natural part of God’s original creation. It entered through sin. When a person dies, they enter a state of silence and inactivity. There is no conscious "work" or "wisdom" in the grave; they are simply waiting.

[DYK] The Hebrew word for grave here is *Sheol*. It refers to the realm of the dead where there is no activity or consciousness, often described in Scripture as a "sleep."

Term Definition: **"Passed upon all men"** indicates that mortality is the shared inheritance of humanity stemming from Adam. We are subject to death because we share in this fallen nature.

Question: Who provides the solution to death, and what is that solution?

Biblical Answer: “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction.” (Hosea 13:14)

“For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so In Christ shall all be made alive.” (1 Corinthians 15:21, 22)

Explanation: Just as death came through a man (Adam), life comes through a Man (Christ). Jesus does not merely help us avoid death; He *ransoms* us from it. He enters the grave to break its power.

[ILL] Imagine a debt so large that it lands a person in a debtor's prison with no hope of release. A benefactor pays the ransom to open the door. Christ pays the debt of sin to open the doors of the grave.

[SN] This creates a beautiful parallel often cited by early Advent believers: Adam, the head of the fallen race, brought death. Christ, the "Second Adam," is the head of the new, spiritual race, bringing life.

Question: Why is the resurrection so essential to our faith?

Biblical Answer: “For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: and if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.” (1 Corinthians 15:16-18)

Explanation: This is a critical point. If there were no resurrection, those who have died in Christ would be "perished"—meaning they would cease to exist forever. This confirms that the reward of the righteous is not given immediately at death, but at the resurrection. Without the resurrection, there is no future life.

Question: When does the resurrection happen, and do all rise at the same time?

Biblical Answer: “Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth.” (John 5:28, 29)

“And they [the righteous] lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.” (Revelation 20:4, 5)

Explanation: The dead are "in the graves" until they hear the voice of Christ. There are two distinct resurrections separated by time. The "First Resurrection" is for the "just" (righteous), who reign with Christ. The "rest of the dead" (the unjust) do not rise until the thousand years end.

[DYK] The concept of two resurrections was a major clarity point for SDA pioneers. It resolved the confusion about how God deals with the righteous versus the wicked.

Question: What kind of body will the righteous receive at the resurrection?

Biblical Answer: “It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory... it is sown in a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.” (1 Corinthians 15:42-44)

“Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body.” (Philippians 3:21)

Explanation: The resurrection is not just a resuscitation of the old, frail body. It is a transformation. We are "sown" like a seed (burial) in weakness and mortality. We are "raised" in power and immortality.

Term Definition: **"Spiritual body"** does not mean a ghost or a bodiless spirit. Jesus had a "glorious body" after His resurrection that could be touched and could eat (Luke 24:39-43), yet was not bound by earthly limitations. Our new bodies will be like His.

[ILL] Consider the difference between an acorn and a mighty oak tree. The acorn (the natural body) is fragile and small. The tree (the spiritual body) is glorious and strong, yet they are historically connected.

Question: What is the final destiny of the righteous and of death itself?

Biblical Answer: “Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.” (Luke 20:36)

“Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.” (Matthew 13:43)

“The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.” (1 Corinthians 15:26)

Explanation: The cycle of sin and death is broken forever. The righteous are recompensed, they are made equal to angels in their immortality, and they "shine" reflecting God's glory. Death, the great enemy, is finally destroyed.

Deeper Insight: The resurrection is the vindication of God’s character. By restoring what sin destroyed, God proves that His love is stronger than death.

Practical Application: How does this hope affect us today?
• It removes the paralyzing fear of death.
• It gives comfort when we lose loved ones—we sorrow, but not as those who have no hope.
• It encourages us to use our current life ("whatsoever thy hand findeth to do") for God’s glory, knowing our labor is not in vain.
