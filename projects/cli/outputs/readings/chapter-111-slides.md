Slide 1 Title: Paul’s Desire: To Depart and Be with Christ

Slide 2 Question: When writing to the church in Philippi, what personal dilemma did the apostle Paul express?

Slide 3 Biblical Answer: “For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better.” (Philippians 1:23)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Paul looking toward a heavenly light, his face full of longing and hope, contrasting with the shadows of his prison.

---

Slide 4 Explanation: Paul describes himself as being under pressure, caught between two strong possibilities. He was torn between continuing his difficult work on earth or laying down his life to rest until the Lord comes.

[DYK] When Paul wrote this, he was likely a prisoner in Rome. He was facing a potential death sentence. His "strait" (difficulty) was not just theoretical; he was literally facing life or death judgment by the Empire.

Slide 5 Question: What does Paul mean by the word “depart”?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.” (2 Timothy 4:6)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Paul handing a finished scroll to a messenger, his posture indicating he has finished his course and is ready to rest.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Paul uses “departure” as a gentle term for death. Just as a ship departs from the dock, death is a leaving of this present world.

---

Slide 8 Term Definition: **Departure** (Greek: *analusai*)

This word was used for unloosing a ship from its moorings or striking down a tent. Paul viewed his body as a temporary tent or vessel (2 Corinthians 5:1).

Slide 9 Question: Paul said “to die is gain” (Phil 1:21). Does this mean he gains a personal reward immediately, or is there a deeper meaning?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “According to my earnest expectation and my hope... that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.” (Philippians 1:20)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a single candle flame being reflected in a mirror, symbolizing Christ being magnified in a believer's life.

---

Slide 11 Explanation: The context shows that the "gain" is the magnification of Christ. If Paul lives, he preaches Christ; if he dies a martyr’s death, his faithfulness witnesses for Christ. In either case, the Gospel gains.

[ILL] Imagine a soldier holding a flag. If he stands and fights, he honors his country. If he falls refusing to surrender, he also honors his country. Paul’s life was entirely about honoring his King, Jesus.

Slide 12 Question: If Paul departs (dies), when exactly does he get to “be with Christ”? Is it immediately, or is there an appointed time?

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout... and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.” (1 Thessalonians 4:16-17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the resurrection, with graves opening and figures rising toward a glorious light in the clouds.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: Paul’s theology was consistent: the reunion with Jesus happens at the Resurrection (the Second Coming). He does not expect to be with the Lord as a disembodied spirit, but rather to be “caught up” along with the resurrected saints when the trumpet sounds.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: The Harmony of Scripture. Paul speaks of receiving a "crown of righteousness," but in 2 Timothy 4:8 he says the Lord will give it to him "at that day"—referring to the day of Christ’s appearing, not the day of his death. The Bible consistently points to the Resurrection as the hope of the believer.

Slide 15 Question: If Paul has to wait in the grave until the Resurrection, why did he say departing is “far better”?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a man resting peacefully in deep sleep, unbothered by the world around him.

---

Slide 16 Biblical Answer: Scripture logic (Ecclesiastes 9:5, Psalm 146:4) teaches that in death, there is no consciousness of time.

---

Slide 17 Explanation: To the one who dies, the very next instant of consciousness is the face of Jesus at the resurrection. Whether 20 minutes or 2,000 years pass on earth, to Paul, it would seem like the twinkling of an eye. It is "better" because the suffering stops, and the next moment is glory.

[ILL] Think of a deep, dreamless sleep or undergoing surgery with anesthesia. You close your eyes, and seemingly one second later, you wake up, even though hours have passed. Death is a rest from labor, and the "waking up" is the resurrection morning.

Slide 18 Question: If resting in death was better for Paul personally, what inclined him to choose life?

---

Slide 19 Biblical Answer: “Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.” (Philippians 1:24)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Paul teaching a group of people, gesturing with worn hands, putting their needs first.

---

Slide 20 Explanation: This reveals Paul’s heart. Even though he was tired and longed for the rest that comes with death, he was willing to endure more suffering if it helped the church. He put the needs of others above his own desire for rest.

Slide 21 Practical Application:

1.  **Confidence in Death**: Death is a "departure"—a sleep that ends with the voice of Jesus.
2.  **Selflessness**: Are we willing to labor for the good of others, even when we are tired?
3.  **Hope**: Our great hope is the Resurrection—the moment we will "ever be with the Lord."
