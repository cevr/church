Study Title: The New Jerusalem: Our Heavenly Home

Question: Has God prepared a specific dwelling place for His people?

Biblical Answer: “But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city.” (Hebrews 11:16)

Explanation: The Bible reveals that the reward of the faithful is not merely a state of mind, but a real, tangible location. The text describes a "better country" and a "city." Just as a loving parent prepares a room for a coming child, God has actively prepared a permanent home for His family.

Question: Where is this city currently, and what does John describe seeing?

Biblical Answer: “But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.” (Galatians 4:26) ... “And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God, out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.” (Revelation 21:2)

Explanation: The city currently exists in heaven ("Jerusalem above"). John’s vision reveals that this city will eventually descend from heaven. It is described as a "bride," indicating the deep love and intimacy Christ has for this place and the people within it.

[ILL] Imagine a weary traveler who has lived in tents and temporary shelters all their life finally seeing a permanent, glowing mansion built just for them. This was the experience of Abraham, who "looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God" (Hebrews 11:10).

Question: How large is this city?

Biblical Answer: “And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs.” (Revelation 21:16)

Explanation: The city is perfectly symmetrical ("foursquare"). The measurement of 12,000 furlongs likely refers to the circumference.

[DYK] A furlong is an ancient unit of measure. 12,000 furlongs represents a circumference of about 1,500 miles (approx. 2,400 km). This suggests the city is roughly 375 miles (600 km) on each side—vastly larger than any city on earth today, capable of housing billions.

Question: What materials are used in the construction of the New Jerusalem?

Biblical Answer: “And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass.” (Revelation 21:18) ... “And the twelve gates were twelve pearls.” (Revelation 21:21)

Explanation: The construction defies earthly physics; the gold is so pure it is transparent like glass. The walls are jasper, and the gates are single, massive pearls. The foundations are adorned with twelve distinct precious stones (Sapphire, Emerald, Amethyst, etc.).

[SN] Spirit-led Tangent: The twelve stones in the foundation mirror the twelve stones on the High Priest's breastplate in the Old Testament sanctuary (Exodus 28). This suggests a connection between God’s ancient covenant people (Israel) and the eternal city. It implies that the city is the fulfillment of the Sanctuary service—God dwelling permanently among His people.

Question: Who is granted citizenship to enter through the gates?

Biblical Answer: “Blessed are they that do His commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Revelation 22:14)

Explanation: Entry is reserved for those who have been reconciled to God and walk in His ways. The text explicitly links access to the city with obedience to God’s commandments. Conversely, Revelation 21:27 notes that anything that "defileth" or makes a "lie" is excluded.

Term Definition: "Tree of Life" — This is the same tree mentioned in Genesis in the Garden of Eden. Adam lost access to it through sin; in the New Jerusalem, access is restored by Christ (the Second Adam), granting eternal physical vitality to the redeemed.

Question: What will life be like inside the city?

Biblical Answer: “And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.” (Revelation 21:4)

Deeper Insight: The "former things"—the history of sin, suffering, and separation—are gone. The prominent object in the city is the throne of God and the Lamb (Rev 22:3). Life flows from God literally (the river of water of life) and spiritually.

[ILL] In this world, even our best cities have hospitals, cemeteries, and police stations because of sickness, death, and crime. The New Jerusalem has none of these, for the causes of sorrow have been eradicated.

Practical Application: Since we look for such a city, what manner of persons ought we to be?
• We live as "pilgrims" here, not too attached to earthly possessions.
• We cherish God's commandments as the laws of our future country.
• We find hope in our darkest moments, knowing that pain has an expiration date.

God has prepared the city; He invites you to prepare for citizenship.
