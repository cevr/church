Study Title: God’s Message for Our Time: The Power of Present Truth

---

Slide 1 Question: By what means does God make us holy?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.” (John 17:17)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, a shaft of light illuminating Him, creating a solemn and holy atmosphere.

---

Slide 3 Explanation: To “sanctify” means to set apart for a holy use or to make holy. Jesus teaches that exposure to God's truth is not merely educational; it is transformational. It is the agent God uses to change our hearts and lives.

---

Slide 4 Term Definition: “Sanctify” comes from a root word meaning “holy.” In the Bible, it implies a process of becoming more like God in character by separating oneself from sin.

Slide 5 Question: Is it enough just to know the truth, or is something else required?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit.” (1 Peter 1:22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a disciple actively washing the feet of another or serving bread, demonstrating faith in action, warm earth tones.

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Knowledge alone does not purify the soul; obedience does. When we believe the truth and act upon it through the power of the Holy Spirit, our character is refined.

[ILL] A prescription from a doctor is “truth”—it states exactly what will cure the illness. However, simply possessing the paper cures nothing. One must "obey" the prescription by taking the medicine to be healed.

---

Slide 8 Question: Does the Bible suggest that certain truths are especially important for specific times?

Slide 9 Biblical Answer: “Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.” (2 Peter 1:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the Apostle Peter writing a letter on parchment, intense focus in his expression, candle flame steady.

---

Slide 10 Explanation: The apostle Peter uses the phrase “present truth.” While all of God's Word is eternally true, certain messages are of special importance to a specific generation or time period.

Slide 11 Did You Know?

[DYK] The term "Present Truth" was a favorite of the early SDA pioneers. They understood that while we must believe all Scripture, God sends specific messages (like "meat in due season") to prepare His people for the immediate crises they face.

Slide 12 Question: What was the "present truth" in the days of Noah?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of storm clouds gathering on the horizon over an ancient landscape, ominous but majestic.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before Me... Make thee an ark of gopher wood.” (Genesis 6:13, 14)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Noah and his sons working on the massive wooden frame of the Ark, sunlight breaking through clouds.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: For Noah's generation, the truth that saved them was the warning of the flood and the command to enter the ark. General belief in God was not enough; they had to accept the *specific* message for their time to be saved.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of the diverse animals entering the Ark two by two, onlookers watching in the distance.

---

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: In every age, "present truth" divides the world. In Noah’s day, there were only two classes: those in the ark and those outside. In the last days, there will be those who receive the seal of God and those who do not.

Slide 16 Question: How did the religious leaders of Jesus' day react to the "present truth" proclaimed by John the Baptist?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of Pharisees in rich robes whispering among themselves, looking skeptical and proud.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.” (Luke 7:30)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of John the Baptist standing in the Jordan River, pointing to heaven, while religious leaders turn their backs and walk away.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: The religious leaders were well-versed in the writings of Moses (past truth), but they rejected the forerunner of Christ (present truth). By rejecting the message sent specifically for their time, they rejected God's counsel.

[SN] Spirit-led tangent: Consider the tragedy of the response in John 9:29, “We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow [Jesus], we know not from whence He is.” It is possible to be so fixated on how God worked in the *past* that we miss how He is working in the *present*.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a Pharisee holding an open scroll of Moses tightly, while Jesus walks by unnoticed in the background.

---

Slide 19 Question: Is there a special message of "present truth" for the final generation?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a dramatic sky, angels flying in the midst of heaven with trumpets, soft ethereal light.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.” (Revelation 14:12)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a group of faithful believers standing together, looking upward with hope and endurance, holding scrolls.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: Just as Noah had a specific message (the Ark) and John the Baptist had a specific message (Repent, the Messiah is here), the last generation has a specific message. It calls for a group of people who patiently endure, strictly observe God's commandments, and hold fast to the faith of Jesus.

Slide 22 Illustration

[ILL] If a watchman blows the trumpet to warn of a fire when the enemy is actually attacking the gates, he may be telling the truth about fire safety, but he is failing his duty. "Meat in due season" (Matthew 24:45) means giving the right message at the right time.

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a watchman on a high stone wall blowing a silver trumpet, gazing intently at a specific danger on the horizon.

---

Slide 23 Practical Application: How can we ensure we are established in present truth?

• Study the prophecies related to the end of time.
• Cultivate a willingness to obey new light as it is revealed from Scripture.
• Do not rest solely on the traditions of the past, but ask, "What does God require of me *today*?"
• Share this message with the urgency of Noah or John the Baptist.
