Slide 5 Did You Know?

[DYK] The Greek concept of meekness (*praus*) was often used to describe a warhorse that had been broken in. It did not mean the horse was weak; it meant it had great strength that was now under the perfect control of its master.

Slide 6 Question: Who is the ultimate example of this grace, and what does He invite us to do?

Slide 8 The Invitation and Promise:
1.  **The Invitation:** “Come unto Me”
2.  **The Model:** Christ is “meek and lowly”
3.  **The Result:** “Rest unto your souls”

Slide 9 Explanation: Jesus claims this trait for Himself. If the King of Kings is meek, it cannot be a degrading quality. By taking His yoke, we do not carry a heavy burden, but rather we learn the secret of soul-rest: surrendering the need to fight for our own supremacy.

Slide 10 Illustration: The Yoke

[ILL] Imagine two oxen yoked together. If a young, inexperienced ox is yoked with a strong, seasoned ox, the younger one learns the pace and path of the elder. Jesus invites us into the yoke with Him so we can learn His gentleness and find rest from the exhaustion of pride.

Slide 12 Biblical Answer:
*   **In Restoration:** “Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault... restore such a one in the spirit of meekness...” (Galatians 6:1)
*   **In Witnessing:** “...be ready always to give an answer... with meekness and fear.” (1 Peter 3:15)

Slide 13 Deeper Insight: True spirituality is evidenced by how we treat the fallen. Harshness drives the sinner further away; a spirit of meekness seeks to heal the wound. Furthermore, when defending the truth, we must do so without arrogance.

[SN] Note the connection between Moses and Christ. Moses was the meekest man on earth (Numbers 12:3) yet a great leader. Both he and Christ interceded for the people rather than destroying them.

Slide 15 Biblical Answer: “...even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.” (1 Peter 3:4)

---

Slide 16 Explanation: The world values external adornment—gold, apparel, and elaborate style. God looks at the "hidden man of the heart." A spirit that is calm, gentle, and unresentful is considered a jewel of "great price" to Heaven.

Slide 19 Explanation: It often seems the aggressive and proud possess the earth now, but their hold is temporary. The inheritance of the Earth made New is reserved for the gentle. Zephaniah exhorts us to "seek meekness"—implying that sanctification is a progressive work.

*   **Conflict:** When provoked today, will I respond with irritation or forbearance?
