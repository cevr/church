---

Slide 1 Question: What is the Bible’s definition of faith?

---

Slide 2 Biblical Answer: “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (Hebrews 11:1)

Slide 3 Explanation: Faith is not merely a wish or a positive feeling. The Scripture defines it as “substance”—something tangible and real. It is treating God's promises as present realities, even when our physical eyes cannot yet see them.

---

Slide 4 Term Definition: “Substance” comes from a Greek word meaning “standing under” or “foundation.” It implies that faith is the solid ground upon which our hope rests. It is the title-deed to the things God has promised.

[ILL] Imagine you hold a property deed. You may not be standing on the land yet, nor have you seen the soil, but the deed is the "substance" or proof of your ownership. Faith acts as that deed for God's promises.

Slide 5 Question: How do we obtain this faith?

Slide 6 Biblical Answer: “So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” (Romans 10:17)

---

Slide 7 Explanation: Faith is not something we conjure up from within our own imagination. It is a response to God’s revelation. We cannot trust a God we do not know; therefore, we learn of Him through His Word. As we digest Scripture, our confidence in His character grows.

Slide 8 Did You Know? In the original Greek, "hearing" implies more than just audio processing; it implies understanding and taking heed. To have faith, one must not only listen to the Bible but let its message sink deep into the heart.

Slide 9 Question: Is it possible to please God without this faith?

---

Slide 10 Biblical Answer: “But without faith it is impossible to please Him; for he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.” (Hebrews 11:6)

---

Slide 11 Explanation: God is not merely a concept; He is a Person who interacts with those who seek Him. Coming to God requires two foundational beliefs:
1. That He exists.
2. That He is good and responds to those who pursue Him.

[SN] The phrase "diligently seek" suggests an intense, earnest search. The SDA pioneers often emphasized that religion was not casual; it required the whole heart. Just as the Israelites gathered manna daily, we must seek God's presence with diligence every morning.

Slide 12 Question: Does true faith lead to action, or is it just a mental belief?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of two figures: one sitting idly, the other actively helping a neighbor, contrasting inaction with action.

---

Slide 13 Biblical Answer: “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.” (James 2:26)

“Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God... because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.” (1 John 3:21, 22)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a healthy fruit tree bearing abundant fruit, representing faith producing works.

---

Slide 14 Explanation: There is a vital link between faith and obedience. A body that does not breathe is dead; likewise, a faith that does not result in obedience to God is dead. True saving faith always produces the fruit of a changed life. We do not obey *to be* saved; we obey because we *believe* and love the Saviour.

Slide 15 Deeper Insight: Notice the connection in 1 John: our confidence in prayer ("whatsoever we ask") is linked to a life that harmonizes with God’s will ("keep His commandments"). Disobedience creates a barrier of doubt, but a clear conscience strengthens our faith.

[SN] This harmonizes with the 1888 message of Righteousness by Faith, which teaches that genuine faith in Christ's righteousness naturally empowers the believer to keep the law, not by their own power, but through His abiding Spirit.

Slide 16 Question: What happens when we let doubt enter our minds?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a storm at sea, dark waves rising, creating a sense of instability.

---

Slide 17 Biblical Answer: “And immediately Jesus stretched forth His hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?” (Matthew 14:31)

“Let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.” (James 1:7)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of Peter sinking into the waves, looking terrified, while Jesus stands firm on the water reaching out.

---

Slide 18 Explanation: Peter began to sink when he took his eyes off Jesus and focused on the storm. Doubt disconnects us from the power of God. When we pray with a "doubtful mind," wavering between belief and unbelief, we cannot take hold of God's hand.

[ILL] A person trying to cross a chasm on a bridge must trust the bridge entirely. If they stand on the edge, trembling and refusing to step out, the bridge cannot help them. Doubt paralyzes our spiritual progress.

Slide 19 Question: What is the ultimate result of having saving faith?

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of storm clouds breaking apart to reveal a calm, golden sunrise.

---

Slide 20 Biblical Answer: “Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.” (Romans 5:1)

“Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing...” (Romans 15:13)

[IMG] Warm classical biblical painting of a face radiant with deep, unshakeable peace and joy.

---

Slide 21 Explanation: The fruit of faith is not anxiety or striving, but peace. When we rely entirely on the merits of Jesus for our salvation and trust His Word for our daily guidance, we enter into a rest that the world cannot understand.

Slide 22 Practical Application: How can we exercise saving faith today?

1. **In Prayer:** Believe immediately that you are forgiven because God said it.
2. **In Trials:** Trust that "all things work together for good."
3. **In Obedience:** Step forward in keeping God's commandments, trusting He provides the power.
