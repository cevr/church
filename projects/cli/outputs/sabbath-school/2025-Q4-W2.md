# 2025 Q4 W2 - October 4-10

## Surprised by Grace

**Overarching Theme:** The Allegiance of Faith: From Condemnation to Covenant
**Central Focus:** The stories of Rahab and the Gibeonites reveal that when
God's judgment is imminent, a faith-based decision to change allegiance and
enter into covenant with Him is the only path to salvation and character
transformation, preparing a people for His kingdom. **Key Texts:** Joshua
2:9-11; Hebrews 11:31; Joshua 9:14, 24

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Imagine a powerful, benevolent kingdom is about to annex a corrupt and
  failing city-state where we live. We hear reports of this kingdom's justice
  and might. We have a choice: cling to the old, doomed system, or find a way to
  declare our allegiance to the new, advancing kingdom. This was the literal
  choice facing the inhabitants of Canaan.
- Theme Introduction: This week, we go deeper than just "grace." We're studying
  the **profound biblical theme** of allegiance. When God's purposes are
  advancing, our survival and our transformation depend entirely on which side
  we choose. This choice is not passive; it is an act of faith that changes
  everything.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Allegiance of Faith"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The Bible is clear that a final judgment is
  coming. These stories in Joshua are not just ancient history; they are a
  living parable for us. God is looking for a people whose allegiance is so
  complete that He can trust them with eternity. This study is about forming
  that kind of character.
- Roadmap: We will first examine the perfect model of faith-based allegiance in
  Rahab. Then, we will contrast it with the imperfect, fear-based allegiance of
  the Gibeonites to draw vital lessons for our own readiness.

### II. The Model of Faith: Rahab's Covenant of Life (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Let's look at Rahab, a woman condemned by her
  culture and profession, who becomes one of the greatest heroes of faith. Her
  story shows us the pattern for true conversion and alignment with God.

#### A. Faith Born from Evidence (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 2:9-11
        -   Reading/Context: The spies are in her home; the city is on high alert. In this moment of extreme danger, she makes the most profound confession of faith.
        -   [WB]: Joshua 2:11 "...He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Rahab's faith was not a blind leap. It was a logical conclusion based on the overwhelming evidence she had *heard*: the parting of the Red Sea, the defeat of Sihon and Og. She correctly interpreted the events of her day as the work of the one true God.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "According to verses 9-11, what specific reports about God's power convinced Rahab to risk her life and change her allegiance?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Hebrews 11:31
        -   Reading/Connection: Centuries later, the Holy Spirit inspires the writer of Hebrews to include her in the great hall of faith. Why? Not because of her past, but because of her faith.
        -   [WB]: Rahab -> "By Faith... did not perish"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The New Testament praises her faith, which was demonstrated by her actions ("received the spies"). This is the heart of the matter. True faith is never just a mental belief; it is a transfer of trust that results in a radical change of behavior. Our great need is for a faith that acts.
        -   [EGW]: "All who, like Rahab the Canaanite, and Ruth the Moabitess, turned from idolatry to the worship of the true God, were to unite themselves with His chosen people." (COL 290.3).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does Rahab's story challenge the idea that our background or past sins can disqualify us from being used mightily by God?"

#### B. The Covenant Sealed by a Sign (7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 2:18-19
        -   Reading/Context: The spies give her a specific instruction—a sign and a condition for salvation.
        -   [WB]: Scarlet Thread = Sign of Covenant
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Exodus 12:13
        -   Reading/Connection: Read this verse about the Passover. The parallel is unmistakable. The scarlet thread in the window served the same purpose as the blood on the doorposts in Egypt.
        -   [WB]: Scarlet Thread <=> Blood on Doorpost
        -   Illustration & Application Bridge:
            -   [SN]: *Illustration:* The scarlet cord was not a secret. It was a public declaration hanging from her window for all to see. It essentially told the invading army, "This property is under the protection of Israel's God." It was a bold, visible transfer of allegiance from the king of Jericho to the King of Heaven.
        -   [EGW]: "By obedience the people were to give evidence of their faith. So all who hope to be saved by the merits of the blood of Christ should realize that they themselves have something to do in securing their salvation. While it is Christ only that can redeem us... we are to turn from sin to obedience. Man is to be saved by faith, not by works; yet his faith must be shown by his works." (PP 279.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The scarlet cord was a visible sign of an inward decision. What are the 'scarlet cords' in our lives today—the practical, visible evidences that show our allegiance has truly changed?"

### III. Imperfect Faith: The Gibeonites' Covenant of Servitude (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Now we turn to a different group who also sought
  an alliance with Israel. Their story provides a powerful contrast and a solemn
  warning about a faith that is mixed with fear and human scheming.

#### A. Acknowledgment Mixed with Deception (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 9:3-6
        -   Reading/Context: The Gibeonites also heard what God had done. But notice their response. It wasn't a simple plea for mercy; it was an elaborate deception.
        -   [WB]: Gibeonites: Acknowledgment + Deception
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 9:24
        -   Reading/Connection: After their deception is uncovered, they reveal their true motive. They were "very much afraid" for their lives because they knew God had commanded their destruction.
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Theirs was a faith born of terror, not transforming trust. They believed in God's power to destroy, but not in His character to save. So, they relied on their own craftiness. This reveals a critical defect in character: trying to manipulate God's blessings rather than surrendering to His will.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Both Rahab and the Gibeonites acted because of what they heard about God. What is the fundamental difference in the *character* of their faith?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 9:14
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions; but they did not ask counsel of the LORD." This is one of the most tragic verses in the story.
        -   [WB]: Critical Failure: "...did not ask counsel of the LORD."
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a doctor performing surgery based only on what the patient *looks* like on the outside, without looking at the X-rays or MRI scans. They relied on sensory evidence (old clothes, moldy bread) when divine insight was available.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "When facing important decisions, what are some practical ways we can 'ask counsel of the Lord' instead of just relying on outward appearances or our own reasoning?"

#### B. Grace, but with Consequences (7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Joshua 9:19-20
        -   Reading/Context: The leaders of Israel are trapped. The people are murmuring, but the oath, made in the name of the Lord, must be honored.
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's grace operates even in the midst of our failures and their deception. They are spared destruction. However, the consequence of their lie remains.
        -   [EGW]: "While their submission to Jehovah secured the preservation of their lives, their deception brought them only disgrace and servitude... Thus through all their generations their servile condition would testify to God's hatred of falsehood." (C&C 122.3).
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Joshua 9:27
        -   Reading/Promise: Joshua assigns them to be "woodcutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD."
        -   [WB]: Saved, but into Servitude.
        -   Deeper Insight: They were saved *into* the camp of Israel, but not with the full rights and inheritance. They were brought near to the sanctuary but in a position of perpetual servitude. This is a profound picture of a salvation that preserves life but, due to a lack of complete, honest surrender, falls short of the full, free status of sonship.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What does this outcome teach us about the character of God, who both upholds His name (the oath) and allows consequences for deception?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen two paths of allegiance. Rahab's, a
  path of honest, evidence-based faith, led to full integration and a place in
  the lineage of Christ. The Gibeonites', a path of fear-based, deceptive faith,
  led to preservation but also to servitude.
- Character Focus Recap: The high **scriptural** calling is for a character
  built on the foundation of Rahab's faith—a complete, honest, and active trust
  in God's Word and His character. This is the only safe position in the closing
  scenes of the great controversy.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `COMPLETE TRUST`
- Call to Action/Decision: The question for us today is, "Which covenant are we
  living in?" One of fearful obligation, or one of loving, trusting allegiance?
  Let us choose today to abandon all human scheming and, like Rahab, cast
  ourselves wholly upon the mercy and promises of God.
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `"CHOOSE YOUR ALLEGIANCE"`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one area will
    you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Rahab's story did not end in Jericho. It
  continued in Bethlehem, in the genealogy of our Savior (Matthew 1:5). A faith
  that changes allegiance not only saves us from judgment but grafts us into the
  very family of God, with a role to play in His eternal purpose.
  - [WB]: Final Hope phrase: `"GRAFTED INTO HIS FAMILY"`
