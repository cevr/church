# 2025 Q3 W2 - July 5-11

## The Burning Bush

**Overarching Theme:** The Divine Process of Qualifying the Called: Unmaking
Self-Reliance to Build God-Reliance. **Central Focus:** Understanding that God's
primary work is **in us** before it can be **through us**. Our character must be
surrendered and sanctified to be a safe and effective channel for His power,
preparing us for His service and His kingdom. **Key Texts:** Exodus 3:1-6,
Exodus 3:10-14, Exodus 4:24-26

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Have you ever felt completely unqualified for something you believed God
  was asking you to do? Moses, after receiving the world's best education and
  then spending 40 years in God's own "school of the desert," felt exactly that
  way.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we are looking beyond the miracle of a bush that
  burns but isn't consumed. We are studying the **profound** biblical process
  God uses to prepare a human being for His divine purpose. It is a process of
  **unmaking** our self-sufficiency so He can **remake** us in His image.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Qualifying the Called: Unmaking & Remaking"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This process is the very heart of
  sanctification. God is infinitely more concerned with our character—our
  fitness for heaven—than He is with the task itself. The work He must do **in**
  us is the absolute prerequisite for the work He can do **through** us.
- Roadmap: We will explore from Scripture how God first prepared Moses by
  teaching him humility and holiness, and then how He met Moses' deep sense of
  inadequacy with His all-sufficient power and presence.

### II. The Unmaking of a Prince: The School of Humility & Holiness (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before God can entrust us with His power, He must
  first empty us of our own pride and self-reliance. This was Moses' 40-year
  education in the wilderness.

#### A. The Forty-Year Classroom of Humility (Est. 7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 3:1
        -   Reading/Context: "Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God."
        -   [WB]: Egypt (Self-Reliance) → Desert (Unlearning/Humility)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: From a prince of Egypt, commander of armies, to a humble shepherd. From the throne room to the backside of the desert. This was not a demotion; it was the most **essential** part of his education for eternity.
        -   [EGW]: "The education that Moses had received in Egypt was a help to him in many respects; but the most valuable preparation for his lifework was that which he received while employed as a shepherd... As he led his flocks through the wilds of the mountains... he learned faith and meekness, patience, humility, and self-forgetfulness." ([MH 474]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think God considered 40 years as a shepherd more valuable for Moses' preparation than 40 years as a prince in the most advanced civilization on earth?"
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a master craftsman who is given a rough piece of wood to carve. His first job is not to add to it, but to sand it down, to chip away all the rough edges and imperfections. The desert was God's sandpaper, smoothing Moses' impetuous character until he was ready for the Master's touch.

#### B. The Encounter with Divine Holiness (Est. 8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 3:4-5
        -   Reading/Context: "So when the LORD saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, 'Moses, Moses!' And he said, 'Here I am.' Then He said, 'Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.'"
        -   [WB]: HOLY GROUND → Remove Sandals (Submission)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The very first lesson in the immediate presence of God is **reverence**. God's absolute holiness demands our complete humility. Taking off his sandals was an act of submission, of acknowledging his own sinfulness and God's purity.
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "What does the command to 'remove your sandals' teach us about the attitude we must have when we approach God in prayer or study His Word?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 3:6
        -   Reading/Connection: "Moreover He said, 'I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the fruit of 40 years of unlearning. The proud prince who once struck a man down in his own strength now hides his face in awe. He finally understands his own nothingness before the Holy One. He is now ready to be commissioned.
        -   [EGW]: "Man cannot by searching find out God. Let none seek with presumptuous hand to lift the veil that conceals His glory... It is a proof of His mercy that there is the hiding of His power; for to lift the veil that conceals the divine presence is death." ([MH 436, 438]).
        -   [WB]: Hid His Face (Awe & Reverence)
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "In our modern, often casual world, what is one practical thing we can do this week to cultivate a deeper sense of reverence for God's holiness?"

### III. The Making of a Prophet: Divine Sufficiency for Human Inadequacy (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Once we are emptied of self, God is ready to fill
  us with His Spirit and power. Here, God meets every human inadequacy with a
  divine promise.

#### A. The Divine Answer to Human Inadequacy (Est. 8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 3:10-11
        -   Reading/Context: "'Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh...' But Moses said to God, 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?'"
        -   [WB]: Moses' Question: "Who am I?"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the **right question!** It shows his preparation is complete. He no longer trusts in his own ability. Acknowledging our total inadequacy is the **necessary starting point** for God to work through us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How is Moses' question 'Who am I?' different from an excuse? When does self-distrust become a virtue?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2 & 3:** Exodus 3:12 & 3:14
        -   Reading/Connection: "So He said, 'I will certainly be with you.'... And God said to Moses, 'I AM WHO I AM.'"
        -   [WB]: God's Answer: "I WILL BE WITH YOU" → "I AM"
        -   Deeper Insight: God never answers the question "Who am I?". He redirects the focus entirely. The success of the mission depends not on the instrument, but on the One who wields it. "I AM" is the ultimate promise: He is the self-existent, all-sufficient One. He **is** whatever we need.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A simple electrical wire is worthless for providing light on its own. But when it is connected to the power station, it can illuminate a whole city. Our qualification is not in the quality of the wire, but in our connection to the Power Source—the great "I AM."
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "When you feel weak, afraid, or confused, how does remembering God's name, 'I AM,' provide the specific help you need?"

#### B. The Non-Negotiable of Total Obedience [*] (Est. 7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Exodus 4:24-25
        -   Reading/Context: "And it came to pass on the way, at the encampment, that the LORD met him and sought to kill him. Then Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son..."
        -   [WB]: Known Duty → Disobedience = DANGER
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is a startling and solemn lesson. After receiving the highest commission, Moses' life is at risk. Why? He was proceeding to teach God's law while knowingly neglecting one of its specific requirements in his own home.
        -   [EGW]: "While Moses was living in neglect of one of God's positive commands, his life would not be secure, for God's angels could not protect him while in disobedience." ([SG3 195, 196]).
        -   Practical Step: God's representative must be a model of **total surrender**. There can be no private compromises or neglected duties if we are to be safe channels of His holy power. Our influence and our very security depend on it.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Without sharing personal details, why is it that neglecting what we think are 'small' known duties can disqualify us from being used by God in 'large' matters?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen God's unchanging process in
  Scripture: He calls us, empties us of self-pride through life's deserts
  (Humility), reveals His awesome holiness (Reverence), and then promises His
  all-sufficient presence to the one who will walk in complete surrender
  (Obedience).
- Character Focus Recap: The ultimate goal of the burning bush experience was
  not just to liberate Israel, but to perfect the character of Moses. God's call
  on our lives today has the same primary purpose: our sanctification and
  fitness for His eternal kingdom.
  - [WB]: `HUMILITY → REVERENCE → OBEDIENCE`
- Call to Action/Decision: God is calling each of us to a specific work. Our
  natural response may be, "Who am I?" God's answer is, "I AM." The call today
  is to surrender our excuses, obey Him fully in the things we already know, and
  step forward in faith, trusting His presence.
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `"SURRENDER & OBEY"`
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Moses was transformed from a man of
  self-distrust to one who was "eloquent, hopeful, self-possessed, and well
  fitted for the greatest work ever given to man." This is God's promise to us.
  - [EGW]: "This is an example of what God does to strengthen the character of
    those who trust him implicitly, and give themselves unreservedly to his
    commands." ([GW 359]).
  - [WB]: Final Hope: `"I WILL BE WITH YOU"`
