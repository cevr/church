## Choose This Day!

**Overarching Theme:** The Anatomy of a Consecrated Choice: From Human Vow to
Divine Enablement **Central Focus:** To move beyond a one-time, emotional
decision for God to a daily, surrendered life of obedience, recognizing our own
inability and embracing His all-sufficient power for character transformation.
**Key Texts:** Joshua 24:15, 19, 23; Deuteronomy 5:6-7

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: We all love the powerful declaration, "As for me and my house, we will
  serve the Lord." It's a statement of commitment. But have you ever made a
  promise to God with all sincerity, only to find yourself failing days or even
  hours later? The Bible anticipates this struggle. Today, we're going to look
  at the anatomy of a real, lasting choice for God.
- Theme Introduction: Our theme is **The Anatomy of a Consecrated Choice**.
  We'll move past the surface of Joshua's call and discover the profound
  biblical secret to making a decision that sticks—not through our willpower,
  but through His power. This isn't just about history; it's about our daily
  walk and our fitness for heaven.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme: "The Consecrated Choice"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: In these last days, the final test is over
  worship. Our choice of whom we serve determines our character, and our
  character determines our destiny. A divided heart cannot stand. God is calling
  for a people whose choice is settled, sealed, and supernaturally sustained.
- Roadmap: First, we will examine the divine foundation God lays for our choice.
  Second, we will confront the startling reality of our own inability. Finally,
  we will uncover the biblical path to making our choice a victorious reality.

### II. The Divine Foundation: Remembering God's Faithfulness (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before Joshua asks Israel to _choose_, God asks
  them to _remember_. A true choice is never made in a vacuum; it is a response
  to God's prior action. Our service is rooted in His salvation.

#### A. God's Unilateral Grace as the Basis for Covenant ({Est. 8-10 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 24:2-5
        -   Reading/Context: Joshua begins a history lesson, but notice who the main character is. "Thus says the LORD God of Israel: '...I took your father Abraham... I gave him Isaac... I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt...'"
        -   [WB]: List: "I took..." "I gave..." "I sent..." "I plagued..."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God is the great Initiator. Israel's entire existence is a product of His grace. He called Abraham out of idolatry, provided the promised line, and delivered them from bondage. They did not earn this; it was all a gift.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 24:11-13
        -   Reading/Connection: He continues, "...you went over the Jordan... the inhabitants... fought against you; but I gave them into your hand... I sent the hornet before you... you did not do it with your sword or with your bow. I have given you a land for which you did not labor..."
        -   [WB]: Add to list: "I gave..." "I sent..." "I have given..."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God makes it emphatically clear: their victory and inheritance were not their own doing. The greatest danger to their spiritual life was forgetting this and believing they had achieved it themselves. This is the root of pride and self-reliance, which makes true service impossible.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Looking at these verses, what is the clear message God wants Israel—and us—to understand before we ever promise Him anything?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a man drowning in a raging river. A rescuer dives in, pulls him out, performs CPR, wraps him in a warm blanket, and gives him shelter. The rescuer then says, "Now, choose to stay here in safety." The choice is not about earning the rescue; it's about gratefully accepting the new life you've been given. God has done all the rescuing; our part is to choose to live in the reality of that rescue.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does viewing our relationship with God as a response to His rescue change the way we think about our 'service' or 'obedience'?"

#### B. The Resulting Call to an Undivided Heart ({Est. 7-8 mins}) [*]

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Deuteronomy 5:6-7
        -   Reading/Context: This is the preamble to the Ten Commandments at Sinai. Notice the pattern: first, God states what He has done ("I am the LORD your God who brought you out of... bondage"), and *then* He gives the command ("You shall have no other gods before Me").
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's law is not a list of rules to earn salvation; it is the framework for a loving relationship given to those already saved by grace. Allegiance is the natural response of a grateful heart.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Joshua 24:14-15
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Now therefore, fear the LORD, serve Him in sincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served... And if it seems evil to you to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve... But as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."
        -   [WB]: "REMEMBER (v. 2-13) -> Therefore -> CHOOSE (v. 14-15)"
        -   Practical Step: The choice is a logical conclusion based on overwhelming evidence of God's goodness. It requires two actions: **1. A turning to God** ("serve Him in sincerity") and **2. A turning from idols** ("put away the gods"). It cannot be one without the other. This decision demands a whole-hearted, exclusive commitment.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Joshua's choice was personal and public ('As for me and my house...'). In what practical ways can we make our choice for God clear both in our private lives and before others?"

### III. The Sobering Reality: Confronting Our Inability (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The people respond with enthusiasm, making a bold
  promise. But Joshua, the wise and aged leader, gives a startling, almost
  discouraging, reply. Herein lies the deepest truth of the chapter.

#### A. The People's Vow and the Leader's Rebuke ({Est. 8-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 24:16-18
        -   Reading/Context: The people respond correctly! They recount God's mighty acts and declare, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD... we also will serve the LORD, for He is our God."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Their hearts are in the right place. Their motives seem pure. They are making a promise based on gratitude. This sounds like a perfect ending. But it's not.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 24:19
        -   Reading/Challenge: "But Joshua said to the people, '**You cannot serve the LORD, for He is a holy God.** He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.'"
        -   [WB]: "You CANNOT serve the LORD" (Josh 24:19)
        -   Deeper Insight: This is one of the most pastorally profound statements in the Old Testament. Why would Joshua say this? Was he trying to crush their spirits? No. He was forcing them to confront the fatal flaw in their promise: **self-reliance**.
        -   [EGW]: "Before there could be any permanent reformation the people must be led to feel their utter inability in themselves to render obedience to God... While they trusted in their own strength and righteousness, it was impossible for them to secure the pardon of their sins; they could not meet the claims of God's perfect law, and it was in vain that they pledged themselves to serve God." (PP 524.1).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...utter inability in themselves..."
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Has there ever been a time you felt that 'utter inability' Sister White speaks of? Why is it actually a crucial—and even hopeful—step in our walk with God?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a young child promising his father, "Dad, I'm strong! I'll carry this heavy box of tools to the car for you!" The father smiles, knowing the child's strength is insufficient and he will inevitably drop it. The father isn't trying to be cruel when he says, "You can't carry that alone, son." He's inviting the child to say, "Okay, Dad, can you help me?" or better yet, "Dad, will you carry it for me?" Joshua is trying to get Israel to stop boasting in their strength and ask for God's.

#### B. The Path to an Empowered Choice ({Est. 7-8 mins}) [*]

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 24:22-23
        -   Reading/Connection: After their repeated insistence, Joshua says, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD..." Then he gives the key: "Now therefore, **put away the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your heart to the LORD God of Israel.**"
        -   [WB]: Action: "Put Away Idols" -> "Incline Your Heart"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The true choice is not just a verbal promise; it's an act of **purging** and **surrendering**. The "foreign gods" were not just statues; they were idols of the heart—secret affections, compromises, and reliance on things other than God. To "incline your heart" is a conscious act of will to yield to God's will.
        -   [EGW]: "[Joshua] knew that unless the people took a decided stand to serve the Lord with all their hearts, they would continue to separate themselves farther and farther from Him... While a portion of the Hebrew host were spiritual worshipers, many were mere formalists; no zeal or earnestness characterized their service." (ST, May 19, 1881).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What are some of the 'foreign gods' that we might be secretly holding onto today that prevent us from fully inclining our hearts to the Lord?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** 1 Kings 11:4, 9
        -   Reading/Example: This is the tragic result of a divided heart. "For it was so, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned his heart after other gods; and his heart was not loyal to the LORD his God... So the LORD became angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned from the LORD..."
        -   Deeper Insight: Solomon, the wisest man, failed where Joshua succeeded. His choice, once seemingly firm, was eroded by compromise. This is the stark warning attached to Joshua 24. A choice not continually renewed through surrender will ultimately fail.

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that a true, lasting
  choice is not a boast of human strength. It begins with **remembering** God's
  incredible grace, leads to a grateful **choice**, is tested by the reality of
  our **inability**, and is made real only through daily **surrender** and
  purging of idols.
- Character Focus Recap: The Lord requires a holy character, but Joshua 24:19
  reminds us we cannot produce it. The glorious truth is that when we admit "I
  cannot," we open the door for God to say, "I can." He is the one who perfects
  our character as we continually incline our hearts to Him.
  - [WB]: `HOLINESS` through `SURRENDER`
- Call to Action/Decision: The call today is the same as in Joshua's time. Move
  beyond the simple promise, "I will serve the Lord." Pray a more powerful,
  biblical prayer: "Lord, I choose you today. I cannot serve you in my own
  strength. Please put away the idols in my heart, incline my will to Yours, and
  live out Your life in me."
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `INCLINE YOUR HEART` (Josh 24:23)
- _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what is one 'foreign
  god' or area of self-reliance you will consciously surrender to Christ's power
  this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Joshua finished well. His generation served the
  Lord faithfully. That is God's desire for us, the final generation. Let's make
  that choice today—not a choice of self-confident striving, but of humble,
  moment-by-moment surrender, looking unto Jesus.
  - [EGW]: "The test comes to everyone. There are only two sides. On which side
    are you?" (8T 120.3).
  - [WB]: Final Phrase: `ON WHICH SIDE ARE YOU?`
