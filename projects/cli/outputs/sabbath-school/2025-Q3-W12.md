## "Please, Show Me Your Glory"

**Overarching Theme:** Beholding to Become: Transformation Through Knowing God's
Character **Central Focus:** Understanding that true sanctification and
readiness for heaven come not from our own effort, but from beholding the glory
of God's character, which transforms us into His likeness. **Key Texts:** Exodus
33:12-18, Exodus 34:5-8, 2 Corinthians 3:18

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Have you ever felt completely inadequate for a task God has called you
  to? As a parent, an elder, a witness to a neighbor? Where do we find the
  strength and the character to represent God rightly in a world that is
  watching?
- Theme Introduction: Today we're exploring one of the most profound principles
  of salvation, drawn directly from Scripture: **Beholding to Become**. We will
  see that the secret to character transformation isn't trying harder, but
  looking closer—at the glory of God.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Beholding to Become"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: In these last days, God is calling for a
  people who reflect His character perfectly. This isn't an optional extra; it
  is the very purpose of salvation. Today's study reveals the divine method for
  achieving this readiness.
- Roadmap: We will follow Moses into the very presence of God. First, we'll
  examine his desperate need that led to his bold request. Then, we'll witness
  the revelation God gave him. Finally, we'll uncover from Scripture how that
  revelation transformed him and how it is God's plan to transform us today.

### II. The Divine Invitation: From Desperation to Revelation (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** This section focuses on the essential
  _pre-requisite_ for transformation. It begins not with our strength, but with
  a deep, honest sense of our need. We find Moses after the golden calf
  apostasy, at his lowest point, and that is where God meets him.

#### A. The Cry of an Overwhelmed Leader (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** **Exodus 33:12-13**
        -   Reading/Context: "Then Moses said to the LORD, 'See, You say to me, "Bring up this people." But You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, "I know you by name, and you have also found grace in My sight." Now therefore, I pray, if I have found grace in Your sight, **show me now Your way, that I may know You**...'"
        -   [WB]: Exodus 33:13 -> "Show me Your way, that I may know You"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Moses realizes his intellectual knowledge *about* God is not enough. He needs to know God *personally* and experientially. His request isn't for a map to Canaan, but for a map into the very heart of God. This is the foundation of all true spiritual growth.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In verse 13, what is the connection Moses makes between knowing God's 'way' and truly 'knowing' God Himself?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** **Exodus 33:15**
        -   Reading/Connection: "Then he said to Him, 'If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.'"
        -   [WB]: Presence > Promises
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is a radical statement of priorities. Moses is declaring that the Promised Land itself is worthless without God's presence. The relationship is more important than the reward. This reveals a character that prioritizes God above all else—the very character God is seeking to develop in us.
        -   [EGW]: "He has gained much, but he longs to come still nearer to God, to obtain a stronger assurance of his abiding presence. He has carried the burden of Israel... now there presses upon his soul a sense of the terrible results, should God leave Israel to hardness and impenitence of heart." (GW 33.1)
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How often do our prayers focus more on the 'Promised Land'—a better job, healing, fixing a problem—than on simply having God's presence, no matter the circumstances? What does Moses' prayer challenge us to change?"

#### B. The Audacious Request (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** **Exodus 33:18**
        -   Reading/Challenge: "And he said, 'Please, show me Your glory.'"
        -   [WB]: "Show me Your GLORY"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the climax of his plea. What is this "glory"? Is it a blinding light? A powerful sound? This was not a request born of idle curiosity.
        -   [EGW]: "Moses did not make this request from idle curiosity. He had an object in view. He saw that in his own strength he could not do the work of God acceptably. He knew that if he could obtain a clear view of the glory of God, he would be enabled to go forward... not in his own strength, but in the strength of the Lord God Almighty." (ARSH, May 11, 1897, par. 5)
        -   [WB]: Glory = Strength for Mission
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine trying to describe your best friend to a stranger. You wouldn't just show a photograph (their outward appearance). You would describe their kindness, their integrity, their faithfulness—their **character**. Moses was asking to see God's character.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** **Exodus 33:19**
        -   Reading/Promise: "Then He said, 'I will make all My **goodness** pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you...'"
        -   [WB]: Glory = Goodness = Character
        -   Practical Step: The first step to real transformation is to desire, above all else, to know God's character. We must come to that point of desperation where we, like Moses, cry out from the heart, "Show me Your glory!"
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "If God's glory is His character, what does it mean for us to pray, 'Show me Your glory' in our daily lives? What are we actually asking God to reveal?"

### III. The Divine Method: From Revelation to Transformation (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Now we move from the request to the divine
  answer. God fulfills Moses' prayer, and in this fulfillment, we find the
  blueprint for how a human being is changed into the likeness of God.

#### A. The Proclamation of the Name (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** **Exodus 34:5-7**
        -   Reading/Context: "Now the LORD descended in the cloud... and proclaimed the name of the LORD. And the LORD passed before him and proclaimed, 'The LORD, the LORD God, **merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty**...'"
        -   [WB]: Draw two columns: `MERCY` (merciful, gracious, longsuffering, goodness, truth, forgiving) and `JUSTICE` (by no means clearing the guilty).
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the "John 3:16 of the Old Testament." God reveals His glory not as a spectacle of power, but as a declaration of His character. It is a perfect, inseparable balance of infinite mercy and perfect justice. This is the character of our God. This is what Moses beheld.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "Why is it so critical for our salvation that God's character includes both immense mercy AND unbending justice? What would be the danger if He was missing one of these?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** **Exodus 34:8**
        -   Reading/Connection: "So Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped."
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon for the first time. You don't start talking about how great you are. You are silenced by the majesty before you. Beholding God's true character produces that same awe and humility in us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "When we truly contemplate the character of God as described in these verses, how does it change our perspective on our own sins and our own attempts at righteousness?"

#### B. The Transforming Reflection (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** **Exodus 34:29**
        -   Reading/Result: "Now it was so, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai... that **Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone** while he talked with Him."
        -   [WB]: Beholding -> Reflecting (unconsciously)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Here is the physical proof of the spiritual transaction. Moses spent time beholding God's character, and he came away reflecting it. The most profound part? He was unaware of the change himself. True holiness is never self-conscious.
        -   [EGW]: "The impress of God was upon him, making him appear as one of the shining angels from the throne." (GW 34.3)
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** **2 Corinthians 3:18**
        -   Reading/Application: "But we all, with unveiled face, **beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image** from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord."
        -   [WB]: `Beholding` (God's Character) -> `Being Transformed` (into His Image)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The Apostle Paul takes the story of Moses and applies it directly to every single believer. This is not a one-time event for a special prophet; it is the New Covenant method of sanctification for ALL of us. Our part is to "behold." The Spirit's part is to "transform."
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "According to 2 Corinthians 3:18, what is our primary role in the process of sanctification? What are some practical ways we can 'behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord' this coming week?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that a deep sense of
  our own inadequacy drives us to seek God's presence (Exodus 33). We've learned
  that God's glory is His holy character—His perfect blend of mercy and justice
  (Exodus 34). And we've discovered the divine law of transformation: by
  beholding His character in the face of Jesus Christ, we are changed into His
  likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18).
- Character Focus Recap: The call to perfection is a call to reflect the
  character of God. This is not achieved by anxious effort, but by faithful
  beholding. The world is starving to see a true reflection of God's goodness.
  - [WB]: `HOLINESS = CHARACTER`
- Call to Action/Decision: The challenge for us this week is simple but
  profound. Where are we looking? Are we beholding our failures, our successes,
  the news, the opinions of others? Or are we, with unveiled faces, beholding
  the glory of the Lord?
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword from Scripture: `"BEHOLD"`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one
    distraction will you intentionally ask God for help to set aside this week,
    to spend more time simply beholding Jesus in His Word?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Moses' face shone so brightly that a nation
  feared to look at him. Soon, Jesus will appear in all His glory. Only those
  who have been transformed by beholding Him now will be able to stand in His
  presence then. Let us make it our life's work and greatest passion to know
  Him.
  - [WB]: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS"` (Hebrews 12:2)
