## The Tabernacle

**Overarching Theme:** The Tabernacle as God's Blueprint for Character
Restoration **Central Focus:** Understanding that God's desire to dwell with us
requires a cooperative process of sanctification, where our willing hearts and
exact obedience, empowered by the Holy Spirit, create a character fit for His
glorious presence. **Key Texts:** Exodus 25:8; Exodus 35:21; Exodus 40:34; John
1:14

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Imagine the creator of the entire universe, a being of infinite power
  and holiness, says, "I want to move into your neighborhood. I want to live
  right next to you." What would that imply? It would imply a change is needed,
  not in Him, but in the neighborhood... and in us. This was the incredible
  reality for Israel.
- Theme Introduction: Today we're studying the Tabernacle, but we're looking
  past the gold and acacia wood to uncover a **profound** biblical theme: The
  Tabernacle is God's divine blueprint for character restoration. It teaches us
  how a holy God makes it possible to dwell with sinful people, and what our
  part is in that process.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Tabernacle: A Blueprint for Our
    Character"
  - [DQ]:
      *(Reflection):*
      "When you hear the phrase 'God wants to dwell with us,' what feelings or questions immediately come to your mind?"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just ancient history. This is the
  pattern for our sanctification. God desires to fill us, His temples today,
  with His glory. Understanding this blueprint is **critical** for our readiness
  to meet Him face to face.
- Roadmap: We will explore the **foundation** for this work—a willing heart.
  Then we'll examine the **process**—following God's divine pattern. And
  finally, we'll see the glorious **result**—a character filled with His
  presence, pointing to Christ and our eternal home.

### II. The Foundation: A Willing Heart and a Sanctifying Sign (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before a single curtain was woven, God
  established the foundational principles for this divine-human partnership. It
  begins not with materials, but with the heart and a sign of relationship.

#### A. The Prerequisite of a Willing Heart (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 25:8 - "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them."
        -   Reading/Context: This is God's stated purpose. It's not about a building; it's about **presence**. His goal is fellowship.
        -   [WB]: `Exodus 25:8` -> `"That I may DWELL among them"`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God takes the initiative. He doesn't wait for us to be perfect; He provides the way for Him to come to us. This is the gospel in miniature.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Based on this verse, what is God's primary motivation for wanting a sanctuary built?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 35:5, 21 - "Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a **willing heart**, let him bring it... And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made **willing**..."
        -   Reading/Connection: God's desire to dwell is met by the people's response. Notice the repetition. The qualification wasn't wealth or skill, but a **willing heart**.
        -   [WB]: Keyword: `WILLING HEART`
        -   [EGW]: "Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in preparing a dwelling place for the Most High." (PP 343.3).
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the core of sanctification. God will not force His presence or His transforming work on us. He waits for our willing surrender. Our character transformation begins the moment our will aligns with His.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Sister White says devotion and sacrifice were the 'first requisites.' Why are these heart attitudes, not just the physical gifts, so crucial in our relationship with God?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a master artist offering to create a masterpiece in your home. He brings the skill, the vision, the tools. All He asks is for you to willingly open the door and give him the space to work. He won't break the door down. Our "willing heart" is us handing Him the key.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What does a 'willing heart' look like in our daily lives—in our prayer life, our study, our service?"

#### B. The Sign of Sanctification (6-8 mins) [*]

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 31:13 - "Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a **sign** between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth **sanctify you**."
        -   Reading/Context: Right in the midst of the sanctuary instructions, God re-emphasizes the Sabbath. It's not a random command; it's intrinsically linked to the work of the sanctuary.
        -   [WB]: `Sabbath = SIGN of SANCTIFICATION`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The sanctuary was the place of sanctification, and the Sabbath is the *sign* of that very work. It's a weekly reminder that the same God who created the world in six days is the one re-creating His character in us.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Exodus 35:31 - "And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship."
        -   Reading/Connection: A willing heart is essential, but insufficient. God provides the power. The same Spirit that empowers for service is the one who sanctifies the heart.
        -   [EGW]: "To those who keep holy the Sabbath day it is the sign of sanctification. True sanctification is harmony with God, oneness with Him in character. It is received through obedience to those principles that are the transcript of His character. And the Sabbath is the sign of obedience." (6T 350.2).
        -   [WB]: `Spirit of God -> Wisdom / Workmanship`
        -   Practical Step: Keeping the Sabbath is more than resting from work; it is a conscious entering into a relationship with our Sanctifier. It is a weekly surrender, allowing the Master Artist to do His restorative work in our character.

### III. The Process: Divine Pattern and Glorious Presence (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** With the foundation of a willing heart laid, God
  provides the exact blueprint. Our cooperation through obedience is the process
  that allows for the glorious result: His presence filling the finished work.

#### A. The Principle of Exact Obedience (7-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 39:42-43 - "According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it **as the LORD had commanded**, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them."
        -   Reading/Context: After all the detailed descriptions, this is the summary statement. The success of the project hinged on this one phrase: "as the LORD had commanded."
        -   [WB]: `As the LORD had commanded` (underline it)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's plan for our restoration is perfect. There is no room for human improvement or deviation. True character perfection is not about becoming a better version of ourselves; it's about being perfectly conformed to His pattern, which is Christ.
        -   - [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine building a complex engine from a blueprint. If you decide a certain gear isn't necessary, or you substitute a part with one you think looks better, the engine won't just be imperfect—it won't work at all. Our character is the "engine" that must run on God's principles, not our own. [*]
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection/Application):* "The Israelites were told to build 'according to the pattern.' In what areas of our lives today do we sometimes prefer our own 'pattern' or ideas over God's clear commands in His Word?"

#### B. The Result: The Indwelling Glory (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 40:34-35 - "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the **glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle**. And Moses was not able to enter... because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle."
        -   Reading/Context: This is the climax. The work is finished according to the pattern, and God moves in. His presence is so pure, so powerful, that even Moses cannot enter.
        -   [WB]: `Obedience -> GLORY FILLS the Tabernacle`
        -   Deeper Insight: This is the goal of sanctification! When a human character is fully surrendered, cleansed, and conformed to the divine pattern, the glory of God—His own character—will inhabit that life so fully that self is no longer seen.
        -   [EGW]: "With deep emotion the people beheld the token that the work of their hands was accepted. ...they murmured low, earnest words of gratitude that God had condescended to abide with them." (PP 349.2).
    -   **Foundation Text 3 & 4:** John 1:14 & Revelation 21:3 [*]
        -   Reading/Connection: The earthly tabernacle was a symbol pointing to a greater reality.
        -   John 1:14 - "And the Word was made flesh, and **dwelt** [literally, 'tabernacled'] among us, (and we beheld his glory...)"
        -   Revelation 21:3 - "Behold, the **tabernacle of God is with men**, and he will dwell with them..."
        -   [WB]: `John 1:14 -> Christ Tabernacled` -> `Rev 21:3 -> God Dwells with Us`
        -   The Ultimate Fulfillment: Christ was the perfect tabernacle, a human life perfectly patterned after God's will, filled with His glory. This is our hope. The process we engage in now is preparing us for that final reality, when we will dwell in His immediate presence for eternity.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing that Christ is the true Tabernacle and our example, how does this change our view of overcoming sin? Is it about our strength, or about allowing His 'tabernacled' life to be reproduced in us?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that God's deepest
  desire is to dwell with us. He has given us the blueprint for this reunion: it
  requires our **willing heart**, our cooperation through **exact obedience** to
  His Word, and our reliance on the **Holy Spirit**.
- [DQ]:
    *(Reflection):*
    'Of all the biblical principles we saw today—the willing heart, exact obedience, the Sabbath sign—which one stands out to you as most challenging or most encouraging in your personal walk with God, and why?'
- Character Focus Recap: The purpose of the Tabernacle was to create a holy
  place for a holy God. The purpose of our lives is to become a holy people—a
  living sanctuary—for that same God.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `HOLINESS (Oneness with God)`
- Call to Action/Decision: The work of building the Tabernacle is finished. But
  the work of building our character continues. God is asking each of us today,
  "Will you give me your **willing heart**? Will you follow My **blueprint**?"
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `"LET THEM MAKE ME A SANCTUARY"`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ Based on God's Word today, what part of your
    "inner tabernacle" will you willingly surrender to the Master Builder this
    week?
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle
  then, and it will fill the earth soon. Our privilege is to be filled with that
  same glory now, in our character. Let us cooperate with Him in this sacred
  work, so we can reflect His image fully.
  - [EGW]: "So Christ set up His tabernacle in the midst of our human
    encampment. He pitched His tent by the side of the tents of men, that He
    might dwell among us, and make us familiar with His divine character and
    life." (DA 23.3).
  - [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS"`
