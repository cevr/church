# 2025 Q4 W3 - October 11-17

## Memorials of Grace

**Overarching Theme:** Sanctified Remembrance: The Foundation for Present Faith
and Final Victory **Central Focus:** How intentional, sanctified remembrance of
God’s past power fuels the obedient faith required to conquer present
"impossibilities" and secure our place in the heavenly Canaan. **Key Texts:**
Joshua 3:5; Joshua 4:21-24; Hebrews 11:1

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: We live in an age of constant distraction and spiritual forgetfulness.
  It is easy to remember our worries, our to-do lists, our grievances. But what
  is the spiritual danger of forgetting God's interventions? It's more than just
  a lapse in memory; it's a disarmament in the great controversy.
- Theme Introduction: Today we explore a theme far deeper than just
  "remembering." We're studying **Sanctified Remembrance**. This is the biblical
  principle of intentionally recalling God's past works not as history lessons,
  but as the very fuel for our present faith and the foundation of our character
  for the final crisis.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Sanctified Remembrance: Faith for Today's
    Jordan"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: Ancient Israel stood before a literal,
  flooding Jordan River, the final barrier to their promised home. We stand
  before the spiritual Jordan of the final test of character before our heavenly
  home. The principles they used to cross are the very same principles we must
  master to be found ready for Christ's return.
- Roadmap: We will examine three biblical stages from Joshua's account:
  1.  The **Prerequisite** of Consecration before the miracle.
  2.  The **Power** of Obedient Faith in the midst of impossibility.
  3.  The **Perpetuation** of Memory for future character development.

### II. The Prerequisite: Consecration for the Impossible (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before God performed one of the greatest miracles
  for Israel, He didn't ask for their strength, their strategy, or their
  courage. He asked for their holiness. Why is personal consecration the
  non-negotiable first step to experiencing God's power?

#### A. Clearing the Way for God's Power (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 3:5 - "And Joshua said to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you.'"
        -   Reading/Context: Israel is on the banks of a raging, overflowing river. The task is humanly impossible. Their first command is not to build rafts, but to purify their hearts.
        -   [WB]: `Joshua 3:5 - "Sanctify yourselves"`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: "Sanctify" means to set apart for a holy purpose. It involves confession, repentance, and the putting away of any known sin. It is a conscious choice to align one's will with God's. God cannot fill a vessel that is already full of self and the world.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Joshua 3:5 connects sanctification *today* with wonders *tomorrow*. In our practical, daily lives, what does it mean to 'sanctify ourselves' in preparation for God to work?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Numbers 14:44 - "But they presumed to go up to the mountaintop... but neither the ark of the covenant of the Lord nor Moses departed from the camp."
        -   Reading/Connection: Contrast Joshua 3 with this tragic event. The previous generation also tried to move forward, but without God's presence and command. This is presumption, not faith. Sanctification is about ensuring God is with us; presumption is rushing ahead without Him.
        -   [WB]: `Faith vs. Presumption`
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How can we, in our Christian walk, distinguish between true, sanctified faith and dangerous presumption?"

#### B. The Step of Obedient Faith (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 3:13, 15 - "...as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the Lord... shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off..."
        -   Reading/Context: Notice the sequence. The water does not part *before* they step. The miracle is triggered *by* their act of obedience in the face of impossible circumstances.
        -   [WB]: Diagram: `Command -> Obedient Step -> Miracle`
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the essence of biblical faith. It is not waiting for all obstacles to be removed. It is acting on God's word *while the obstacles are still there*. This is the character trait God is developing in His people for the end times.
        -   [EGW]: "Before the demand of faith, the obstacles placed by Satan across the pathway of the Christian will disappear; for the powers of heaven will come to his aid. 'Nothing shall be impossible unto you.'" (DA 431).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a master electrician trying to rewire a house. He cannot work safely if the owner keeps leaving other circuits live. To do His powerful work, God first asks us to "turn off the power" of self and sin—to 'sanctify' the worksite—so His divine current can flow powerfully.
        -   **Foundation Text 4:** Hebrews 11:1 - "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
            -   Connection: The priests' faith gave "substance" to the promise of a dry riverbed before they could see it. Their wet feet were the "evidence" of their belief.
            -   [DQ]: *(Personal Application):* "What is a 'flooding Jordan' in your life right now where God is asking you to take a step of faith *before* you see the waters part?"

### III. The Perpetuation: Memorials for Character Formation (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The miracle was powerful, but God knew its memory
  would fade. He immediately commanded a physical reminder. Why? Because
  sanctified remembrance isn't automatic; it must be intentionally cultivated.
  These memorials are not for nostalgia; they are tools for the sanctification
  of the next generation.

#### A. The Purpose of Remembering (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 4:6-7 - "that this may be a sign among you when your children ask in time to come, saying, 'What do these stones mean to you?' Then you shall answer them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the Lord..."
        -   Reading/Context: Twelve men, one from each tribe, are to take twelve stones from the middle of the riverbed. This is a deliberate, representative act.
        -   [WB]: `Joshua 4:6 - "WHAT DO THESE STONES MEAN?"`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The memorial's primary purpose was didactic—to teach. It was designed to provoke questions from those who did not experience the miracle themselves. Our testimonies must do the same. They must be visible enough that others ask "why?"
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "The memorial stones were meant to provoke a question from the children. As a church and as families, how can we live in a way that makes the next generation *ask us* about the reason for our hope?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Deuteronomy 8:2 - "And you shall remember that the Lord your God led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart..."
        -   Connection: Remembering isn't just about God's power, but also about our own journey of character testing and refinement. It reminds us of our weakness and His constant faithfulness.
        -   [EGW]: "Like the people of Israel, let us set up our stones of witness, and inscribe upon them the precious story of what God has wrought for us." (DA 348.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Personal):* "Take a moment to think of a personal 'stone of witness' in your life—a specific deliverance or answered prayer. How has remembering that event strengthened your faith during a later trial?"

#### B. The Result of Remembering (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 4:23-24 - "...so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord is mighty, that you may fear the Lord your God forever."
        -   Reading/Context: The purpose of the memorial had two results: a global witness and a perpetual personal reverence.
        -   [WB]: `Result of Remembrance: 1. Witness to World 2. Fear (Reverence) for God`
        -   Deeper Insight: "Fear the Lord" here means to live in a state of reverent awe, loyalty, and obedience. True remembrance of God's might produces a character of humble, loving obedience. Forgetfulness leads to casualness, which leads to disobedience.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* These stones were not beautiful, polished marble. They were rough, wet, heavy rocks from the middle of a riverbed. Our memorials—our testimonies—don't have to be perfect and polished. The power isn't in the beauty of the story, but in the raw truth it tells: "God was here. He rescued me."
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** 1 Corinthians 10:11 - "Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come."
        -   Connection to Us: This is not just history. The story of the Jordan is an inspired lesson written specifically for us, the final generation. We must learn from it, or we will be unprepared for our own final test.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Joshua 4:24 says the goal is to 'fear the Lord your God forever.' How can practicing 'sanctified remembrance' in our daily lives protect our character from the spiritual apathy of the last days?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that God's mighty
  works are preceded by our consecration. We have seen that true faith steps
  into the flood _before_ it parts. And we've seen that God commands us to build
  memorials, not for the past, but for the preservation of character into the
  future.
- Character Focus Recap: The character God is seeking is one that is so grounded
  in the memory of His faithfulness that it does not hesitate at the banks of
  any future "Jordan." This is the character that will stand through the final
  crisis.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `OBEDIENT FAITH`
- Call to Action/Decision: This week, let us follow God's command. Let's build a
  memorial. Identify one clear instance of God's intervention in your life.
  Write it down. Share it with your family or a fellow believer. Intentionally
  make it a "stone of witness."
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `BUILD YOUR STONE OF WITNESS`
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: We are nearing the borders of the heavenly
  Canaan. A final, spiritual Jordan lies before us. Our only safety is in
  remembering what our God has done. Let us not be a generation that forgets.
  Let us be a people whose hearts are filled with memorials of His grace, giving
  us unshakable faith to follow the Lamb wherever He leads.
  - [EGW]: "We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget
    the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history." (LS
    196).
  - [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `HE WHO PARTED THE JORDAN WILL SEE US HOME`
