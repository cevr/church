# 2025 Q3 W6 - August 2-8

## Through the Red Sea

**Overarching Theme:** The School of Trial: God's Method for Forging End-Time
Character **Central Focus:** Understanding that God sovereignly leads His people
into seemingly impossible situations, not to destroy them, but to destroy their
enemies (both external and internal), reveal His glory, and perfect their faith
for eternity. **Key Texts:** Exodus 14:1-4, 13-15; Hebrews 11:29

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Have you ever felt completely trapped? Hemmed in, with an impassable
  obstacle before you and a threat closing in from behind? This feeling of utter
  helplessness is where our lesson begins. But from God's perspective, this is
  not a dead end; it is a classroom.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we will explore the Red Sea crossing not just as a
  historical miracle, but as a profound revelation of God's method for character
  development. The theme is **The School of Trial**. We will see from Scripture
  how God uses impossible circumstances to teach us the most vital lessons of
  faith.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The School of Trial: Lessons from the Red
    Sea"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The Bible is clear that a people must be
  prepared to stand before a holy God. The trials we face are God's chosen
  instruments to purify our characters, uproot our self-reliance, and prepare us
  to sing the song of victory in the kingdom. The experience of Israel is our
  example.
- Roadmap: We will first examine from Scripture _why_ God intentionally led
  Israel into this crisis. Then, we will study the divine commands given _in_
  the crisis and the character of faith required to obey.

### II. The Divine Setup: Led into Impossibility (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before the miracle, there was the crisis. And
  before the crisis, there was a deliberate, divine plan. Let's look at the
  scriptures to see that Israel's predicament was not an accident, but an
  appointment.

#### A. God's Sovereign, Purposeful Leading (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 13:17-18
        -   Reading/Context: "When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter... So God led the people around by the desert road toward the Red Sea."
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Egypt -> (Short Route X'd out) -> [Long Way] -> Red Sea
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's first decision was a detour. He consciously avoided the easy path to protect their fledgling faith. His leading is always purposeful, even when it seems illogical to us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "According to verse 17, why did God intentionally choose the longer, more difficult route for Israel? What does this tell us about God's priorities for His people?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 14:1-4
        -   Reading/Connection: "Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi Hahiroth... Pharaoh will think, "The Israelites are wandering around the land in confusion, hemmed in by the desert." And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. **But I will gain honor for myself** through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD.'"
        -   [WB]: Verse Ref: Ex. 14:4 "I will gain honor..."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is one of the most profound truths in Scripture. God Himself orchestrated the "trap." He placed them in a position of absolute human hopelessness. Why? To create a stage where His power alone could be demonstrated, and where their faith would be forced to move beyond the realm of sight. Their need was to unlearn self-reliance and learn total dependence.
        -   [EGW]: "In leading them by the way of the Red Sea, the Lord revealed Himself as a God of compassion as well as of judgment." (PP 282).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does it change your perspective on your own trials to know that God might be intentionally allowing them to 'gain honor' and teach you something you couldn't learn on an easier path?"

#### B. The Human Reaction to God's Schooling (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 14:10-12
        -   Reading/Challenge: As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians... They were terrified and cried out to the LORD. They said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you brought us to the desert to die? ... Didn't we say to you in Egypt, 'Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians'?"
        -   [WB]: Keywords: FEAR -> MURMURING -> UNBELIEF
        -   The Character Flaw Revealed: After witnessing the ten plagues and the Passover deliverance, their faith evaporates at the first sight of the enemy. This reveals a character still deeply scarred by slavery—a mindset of fear, complaint, and a desire for the "safety" of bondage over the risks of freedom with God.
        -   [EGW]: "Moses was greatly troubled that his people should manifest so little faith in God, notwithstanding they had repeatedly witnessed the manifestation of His power in their behalf. How could they charge upon him the dangers and difficulties of their situation, when he had followed the express command of God?" (PP 283).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...so little faith..."
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a master blacksmith. To create a strong, tempered sword, he must repeatedly heat the raw metal in a blazing furnace (the trial) and then strike it with a heavy hammer (the pressure). The purpose is not to shatter the metal, but to purify it, strengthen it, and shape it into a vessel of honor. God is the Blacksmith; we are the metal.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "When we face our 'Red Sea' moments, our first reaction is often fear and complaint, just like Israel. Thinking of the blacksmith analogy, what is one thing we can remember that will help us change our reaction from complaint to trust?"

### III. The Divine Command: Faith in the Face of Fear (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** In the midst of panic and accusation, God speaks.
  His commands seem contradictory, but they are the two essential pillars of
  victorious, end-time faith.

#### A. The Posture of Faith: Stand Still and See (7-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 14:13-14
        -   Reading/Context: "Moses answered the people, 'Do not be afraid. **Stand still**, and you will see the salvation of the LORD... The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.'"
        -   [WB]: Command #1: STAND STILL (Cease striving, trust)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The first step in a crisis is not frantic human effort. It is the cessation of panic. It is a conscious choice to quiet our souls, fix our eyes on God, and trust that He is in control. This "stillness" is not passivity; it is an active posture of faith, holding our position while we wait for God's command.
        -   [EGW]: "It was not an easy thing to hold the hosts of Israel in waiting before the Lord. Lacking discipline and self-control, they became violent and unreasonable." (PP 284).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why is the command to 'be still' often the hardest one to obey when we are in a crisis? What does this internal struggle reveal about our own character?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 14:19-20
        -   Reading/Connection: "Then the angel of God... withdrew and went behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them, coming between the armies of Egypt and Israel. Throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other."
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Israel | PILLAR (Light) | Egypt (Darkness)
        -   Deeper Insight: While Israel was commanded to be still, God was not still! He was actively working, repositioning Himself as their rear guard. The very thing that guided them now became their protection. What is a source of guidance and light to God's people is a source of confusion and darkness to His enemies.
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "The same pillar of cloud was light to Israel and darkness to Egypt. How can the same trial in our lives be a source of spiritual 'light' for us, while being a source of 'darkness' or confusion to those who don't have faith?"

#### B. The Action of Faith: Go Forward (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 14:15
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Why are you crying out to me? Tell the Israelites to **go forward**.'"
        -   [WB]: Command #2: GO FORWARD (Obey into the impossible)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: After the command to be still in spirit comes the command to move forward in obedience. God did not part the sea and then invite them to cross. He commanded them to march *towards* the solid wall of water. The miracle happened in response to their step of faith.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Hebrews 11:29
        -   Reading/Context: "**By faith** they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land; but when the Egyptians tried to do so, they were drowned."
        -   [WB]: Keyword: BY FAITH
        -   Practical Step: Faith is not merely believing God *can*, it is acting on His word when there is no evidence of a path. The difference between Israel and Egypt was not the path, but the faith. We are called to step out on the command of God, trusting that He will make a way where there is no way. This is the character that will stand in the last days.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* This is like a father teaching his child to swim. He stands in the pool with open arms and says, "Jump to me!" From the child's perspective, they are jumping into a danger that could overwhelm them. But their faith in the father's word and his waiting arms gives them the courage to leap. Israel had to "jump" toward the water based on God's command.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Moses said 'Stand still,' and God said 'Go forward.' In what practical area of your life right now might God be asking you to 'stand still' from fear and worry, but 'go forward' in an act of obedience?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that God is the
  sovereign architect of our trials. He leads us into impossible places not to
  abandon us, but to separate us from our enemies, to reveal His glory, and to
  forge a faith in us that is pure, strong, and dependent only on Him.
- Character Focus Recap: The Bible calls us to develop a character that does not
  murmur in the trial, but **stands still** in trust and then **goes forward**
  in obedience. This is the faith that overcomes the world.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `FAITHFUL OBEDIENCE`
- Call to Action/Decision: The Red Sea was a one-time event for Israel, but the
  principle is for all time. God is preparing a people to stand through the
  final crisis. He will lead us through our own "Red Seas." The question is,
  will we learn the lesson? Will we trust the Teacher?
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword from Scripture: `"OVERCOME" (Rev. 15:2)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what 'impossible'
    situation will you choose to view as God's classroom for your character this
    week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The story ends with a song of victory.
  Revelation 15 tells us that the redeemed, who have gotten the victory, will
  stand on a sea of glass and sing that very song—"the song of Moses the servant
  of God, and the song of the Lamb." May we learn the lessons of the Red Sea
  today, so we can sing the song of victory tomorrow.
  - [WB]: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase:
    `Rev. 15:2-3 "The Song of Moses & the Lamb"`
