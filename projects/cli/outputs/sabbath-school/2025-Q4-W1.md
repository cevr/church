## Recipe for Success

**Overarching Theme:** Divine Commission, Human Cooperation: The Unwavering Path
to Victorious Character **Central Focus:** To establish from Scripture that
true, eternal success is the fruit of a character wholly surrendered to God's
Word, enabled by His presence, and demonstrated through unwavering obedience in
preparation for inheriting the Heavenly Canaan. **Key Texts:** Joshua 1:7-9;
Psalm 1:1-3; Ephesians 6:10-13

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: We all want a "recipe for success" in life—in our careers, our families,
  our spiritual walk. The world offers thousands of formulas. But today, we're
  opening God's Word to find His original, unchanging, and guaranteed recipe,
  given at a critical moment in salvation history.
- Theme Introduction: The story of Joshua isn't just about conquering a piece of
  land. It is a profound, living parable for God's end-time people. The theme is
  **Divine Commission, Human Cooperation**. God gives the promise and the power,
  but He requires our complete cooperation to develop a victorious character.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Divine Commission, Human Cooperation"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: God's goal for Israel was not just
  possession of Canaan, but the development of a holy character that would
  represent Him to the world. His goal for us is the same: the perfection of our
  characters in His likeness, making us fit to inherit the New Earth. This
  lesson is about our readiness for Christ's return.
- Roadmap: We will examine God’s foundational command to Joshua, see how it is
  the timeless blueprint for all believers, and then apply this divine recipe to
  our own spiritual warfare today.

### II. The Unchanging Blueprint: The Word as Our Foundation (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** God's first words to Joshua as leader lay out a
  non-negotiable foundation for victory. This blueprint is not just for a
  general; it is for every child of God who desires to overcome.

#### A. The Promise That Fuels the Command (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 1:5 - "As I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you."
        -   Reading/Context: God speaks these words to a man facing an impossible task, following in the footsteps of a spiritual giant. This is the foundation of everything that follows.
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The promise is not one of ease, but of **divine presence**. This is the source of all true strength and courage. God does not send us to a battle He will not attend.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What do you think was the most important part of this promise for Joshua at that moment? The comparison to Moses, or the personal promise 'I will be with you'?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 1:7 - "Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper wherever you go."
        -   Reading/Connection: Notice the word "that" (or "so that"). The strength and courage have a specific purpose: **absolute obedience**.
        -   [WB]: `Promise (v.5) -> Courage -> Obedience (v.7) -> Success`
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The courage required wasn't primarily for fighting Canaanites, but for fighting the internal and external temptation to compromise God's explicit commands. It takes more courage to obey God's "thus saith the Lord" than to face a human army.
        -   [EGW]: "`It was with great anxiety and self-distrust that Joshua had looked forward to the work before him; but his fears were removed by the assurance of God...`" (PP 482).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "The command is to be courageous *in order to obey*. In what areas of life today does it take the most courage to strictly obey God's Word without turning 'to the right hand or to the left'?"

#### B. The Method for Sustaining Obedience (10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 1:8 - "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success."
        -   Reading/Context: God now gives the practical *method* for maintaining the courage to obey. It is not a one-time decision, but a continual process.
        -   [WB]: `Meditate Day & Night` -> `Observe to Do`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The Word of God was to saturate his being—spoken ("mouth"), contemplated ("meditate"), and lived ("observe to do"). Success is the *result* of this process, not the goal itself. The goal is faithfulness.
        -   [EGW]: "`The first sword that Joshua used was the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God.... If there had been no peril before Joshua, God would not over and over again have charged him to be of good courage.... He made God his Guide.`" (CC 116).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a master chef giving you their most famous recipe. You wouldn't just glance at it once and then try to cook from memory. You would keep the recipe open, refer to it constantly, measure every ingredient precisely, and follow every step exactly. God has given us His recipe for a successful, holy character in His Word.
        -   [WB]: Write "The Recipe Book" next to "Meditate Day & Night".
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Psalm 1:1-3 - "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly... But his delight is in the law of the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night. He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water..."
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the same principle from Joshua 1, but applied to the individual believer. It confirms the timeless nature of God's recipe.
        -   Practical Step: The promise of being a flourishing, fruit-bearing "tree" is conditional on our delighting in and meditating on God's Word. It is the root system of our spiritual life.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Thinking of the chef's recipe, what is one practical change we could make this week to 'keep the Book open' and meditate on it more consistently, rather than just 'glancing at it'?"

### III. Strength for the End-Time Conquest (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The principles given to Joshua are magnified for
  us who live in the final hours of the great controversy. Our Promised Land is
  a heavenly country, and our warfare is spiritual, demanding an even greater
  reliance on God's recipe.

#### A. Spiritual Warfare and the Armor of God (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Ephesians 6:10 - "Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might."
        -   Reading/Context: Paul echoes God's command to Joshua. He is commissioning the church for spiritual battle.
        -   [WB]: `Joshua 1: "Be strong"` <=> `Ephesians 6: "Be strong"`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Our strength is not our own. It is derivative. It comes from being "in the Lord." This is the essence of surrender and reliance.
    -   **Foundation Texts 2 & 3:** Ephesians 6:11-13, 17 - "Put on the whole armor of God... For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood... but against principalities, against powers... Therefore take up the whole armor of God... and take... the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."
        -   Reading/Connection: The nature of our warfare is spiritual, and our only offensive weapon is the same one given to Joshua—the Word of God.
        -   [WB]: Draw a simple Sword, label it: "Word of God".
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The "fortified cities" we must conquer are habits of sin, cherished idols, and worldly ways of thinking. The courage needed is to use the sword of the Spirit on our own hearts first, allowing it to cut away everything displeasing to God.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Ephesians 6 says we must 'put on' the armor. Joshua was told to 'meditate' on the Word. How are these two commands—putting on armor and meditating on the Word—essentially the same activity for character development?"
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A soldier doesn't just admire his armor in the barracks; he wears it into battle. He trains with his sword until it is an extension of his arm. We don't just read the Bible for information; we must "put it on" through prayerful meditation so it becomes our defense and our very nature in the battle for our character.

#### B. The Harmony of Faith and Obedience (9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Romans 3:31 - "Do we then make void the law through faith? Certainly not! On the contrary, we establish the law."
        -   Reading/Context: Some might think focusing on obedience is legalism. Paul powerfully refutes this.
        -   [WB]: `Faith + Obedience = God's Character`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Faith in Christ is not a substitute for obedience; it is the **source of power** for true obedience. Grace is not only pardon for past sin but power over present sin. Faith connects us to Christ, who then lives out the righteousness of the law in us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "In your own words, how does true faith 'establish the law' in a Christian's life?"
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the final description of God's people who are ready for translation. It is the culmination of Joshua's recipe: a people whose faith has led them into perfect harmony with God's law.
        -   [EGW]: "`God has elected a character in harmony with His law, and anyone who shall reach the standard of His requirement will have an entrance into the kingdom of glory.... The provisions of redemption are free to all; the results of redemption will be enjoyed by those who have complied with the conditions.`" (PP 207-208).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Seeing that keeping the commandments and having Jesus' faith is the final mark of God's people, how does this raise the urgency for us to apply Joshua's 'recipe for success' to our lives today?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture God's unchanging
  recipe: His divine presence empowers our moral courage, which is for the sole
  purpose of exact obedience to His Word. This obedience is sustained by
  constant meditation, and it is all made possible by a faith that establishes,
  not voids, God's holy law.
- Character Focus Recap: The "success" God promises is not worldly prosperity,
  but a **victorious character**—a character restored in the image of Jesus, fit
  for heaven. This is the great object of our lives.
  - [WB]: `SUCCESS = A VICTORIOUS CHARACTER`
- Call to Action/Decision: The battle for our character is won or lost in the
  moments we choose either to open God's Word or to turn to the world's
  distractions. The appeal today is simple and direct: Will you commit, starting
  this week, to the method of Joshua 1:8? To make time, morning and evening, to
  meditate on God's Word, asking Him to write its principles on your heart?
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `COMMIT TO JOSHUA 1:8`
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Joshua's generation entered an earthly land. We
  are on the borders of the heavenly Canaan. The final test is upon us. The time
  for half-hearted service is over. Let us take up God's recipe with all our
  hearts, so that we may be found ready.
  - [WB]:
    `"Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ"`
    (Titus 2:13)
