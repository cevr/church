## God Is Faithful!

**Overarching Theme:** Conditional Security: God's Absolute Promise and Our
Required Response **Central Focus:** To understand from Scripture that while
God's faithfulness is the unshakeable foundation of our salvation, our
moment-by-moment choice to "cleave" to Him in loving obedience determines our
experience of His promises and our fitness for eternity. **Key Texts:** Joshua
21:43-45; Joshua 23:6-11; 2 Timothy 2:11-13

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: In our world, contracts and agreements are everywhere. From a mortgage
  to a mobile phone plan, both parties have responsibilities. What happens when
  one party stops holding up their end of the deal? The agreement, though still
  valid, changes in its outcome. Today we're looking at the most sacred
  agreement—God's covenant with His people.
- Theme Introduction: The Bible declares "God is Faithful." This is an absolute
  truth. But Joshua's final words reveal a profound theme we'll call
  **Conditional Security**. This isn't about earning salvation; it's about
  understanding from Scripture the **cooperation** required to remain within the
  safety of God's covenant promises.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Conditional Security: God's Promise & Our
    Part"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This principle is not just for ancient
  Israel. It is the core of sanctification. God is faithful to provide
  everything we need for a perfect character, but He will not force our will.
  Our daily choices forge a character of faithfulness that prepares us to stand
  in the last days.
- Roadmap: We will explore this from Joshua's message by examining three
  pillars:
  1.  The **Unshakeable Foundation** of God’s perfect record.
  2.  The **Crucial Framework** for our daily faithfulness.
  3.  The **Sobering Future** determined by our choice.

### II. The Unshakeable Foundation: God's Perfect Record (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before Joshua calls Israel to action, he first
  cements their minds on the absolute, historical reality of God's faithfulness.
  Our faithfulness must always begin with a clear view of His.

#### A. The 'All' of God's Promises (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 21:45
        -   Reading/Context: "Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass." This is God's divine report card at the end of the conquest.
        -   [WB]: Joshua 21:45 -> "ALL CAME TO PASS"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The word "all" is used six times in verses 43-45. God gave *all* the land, delivered *all* their enemies, and fulfilled *all* His promises. God does not deal in partial faithfulness. His character and His promises are complete.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What does this emphatic repetition of the word 'all' in Joshua 21:43-45 tell us about the character of God and the nature of His promises?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 21:44
        -   Reading/Connection: "The LORD gave them rest round about... and the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand." This verse connects God's promise to their tangible experience of peace and victory.
        -   [WB]: Rest & Victory = GIFTS from God
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Israel did not *achieve* rest; they *received* it. They did not *earn* victory; it was *given*. This is grace. Our greatest character need is humility, to remember that any spiritual victory we have is a gift of God, lest we take the credit and fall into pride.
        -   [EGW]: "[T]hese examples of human steadfastness bear witness to the faithfulness of God's promises—of His abiding presence and sustaining grace. They testify to the power of faith to withstand the powers of the world." (CC 369.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does remembering that our spiritual rest and victories are gifts, as Israel's were, protect our character from self-reliance?"

#### B. The Unchanging Nature of God's Faithfulness (7 mins)

    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a world-class doctor who provides a patient with a perfect, life-saving treatment plan and the necessary medicine. The doctor's part is perfectly faithful. But if the patient refuses to follow the plan or take the medicine, they will not be healed. The failure is not in the doctor's faithfulness, but in the patient's cooperation.
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** 2 Timothy 2:13
        -   Reading/Challenge: "If we are faithless, he remains faithful—for he cannot deny himself." How do we reconcile this with the warnings that follow in Joshua?
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's faithfulness means He is true to His **entire** character and His **entire** Word. He is faithful to His promises of blessing for obedience, and He is equally faithful to His warnings of consequence for disobedience. He cannot "deny himself" by ignoring sin.
        -   [WB]: God is Faithful to: PROMISES & WARNINGS
        -   [EGW]: "Satan deceives many with the plausible theory that God's love for His people is so great that He will excuse sin in them... But in all His dealings with His creatures God has maintained the principles of righteousness by revealing sin in its true character... The unconditional pardon of sin never has been, and never will be." (PP 522.1).
        -   [WB]: "Unconditional pardon... never has been"
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Based on this concept, how does God's faithfulness actually give more weight and seriousness to His warnings against sin?"

### III. The Crucial Framework: Our Mandate for Faithfulness (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** With God's perfect record established as the
  foundation, Joshua now builds the framework of responsibility for God's
  people. This is our part.

#### A. The Conditions for Continued Blessing (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 23:6
        -   Reading/Context: "Therefore be very **courageous** to keep and to do all that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses..."
        -   [WB]: OBEDIENCE REQUIRES COURAGE
        -   Deeper Insight: Why does obedience require courage? Because it demands active, constant resistance against the downward pull of the world, the flesh, and the devil. It is not a passive state but a decisive, moment-by-moment battle. Passivity leads to drift and apostasy.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "In our daily lives, what are some specific situations where choosing to 'keep and to do' what God asks requires real courage?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2 & 3:** Joshua 23:7-8
        -   Reading/Connection: "...do **not** associate with these nations... do **not** make mention of the name of their gods... but you **shall hold fast** [cleave] to the LORD your God."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Joshua presents a clear choice with no middle ground. The danger was not in being neighbors, but in spiritual assimilation. Friendship with the world's principles is enmity with God. The Hebrew for "hold fast," *dabaq*, is the same word used in Genesis 2:24 for a husband "cleaving" to his wife. This is a call to intimate, loyal, exclusive relationship.
        -   [WB]: AVOID Assimilation -> CLEAVE to God
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a pristine, white garment. You cannot simply "associate" with a grease stain. The moment of contact causes contamination. Our characters are to be the righteousness of Christ, and we must guard them from the contaminating principles of the world with utmost care.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The word 'cleave' implies a deep, personal relationship like in a marriage. Beyond just avoiding sin, what are practical ways we can actively 'cleave' to God this week?"

#### B. The Heart of Covenant Loyalty (7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Joshua 23:11
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Therefore take careful heed to yourselves, that you **love** the LORD your God."
        -   The Core Principle: This is the engine of obedience. All the "don'ts" in the previous verses are made possible by this one great "do." Love is the motive. Obedience is not a dry, legalistic duty; it is the natural response of a heart captivated by the love and faithfulness of God.
        -   [WB]: Love -> The MOTIVE for Obedience
    -   **Foundation Texts 5 & 6 (The Consequences):** Joshua 23:15-16
        -   Reading/Context: "Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all the good things have come upon you... so the LORD will bring upon you all the harmful things... When you have transgressed the covenant... you shall perish quickly from the good land."
        -   Deeper Insight: Here is the other side of "Conditional Security." God’s faithfulness to His Word is demonstrated just as powerfully in His justice as in His mercy. This is not an angry, arbitrary God; this is the God who must honor the principles of His own government.
        -   [EGW]: "There are limits even to the forbearance of God, and many are exceeding these boundaries. They have overrun the limits of grace, and therefore God must interfere and vindicate His own honor." (CTr 119.5).
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "How does understanding that God's justice is part of His faithfulness change our view of sin and the need for a perfect character?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that God's
  faithfulness is perfect and complete—it is our unshakeable foundation. We have
  also seen His call for our response: a courageous, loving, "cleaving"
  faithfulness that guards the heart against worldly compromise.
- Character Focus Recap: The Bible is clear: our character determines our
  destiny. God's purpose is to restore His own character of faithfulness in us.
  This requires our consent and cooperation. He is faithful to warn us that
  continued, willful disobedience will lead to separation from Him.
  - [WB]: `FAITHFULNESS` (God's) -> `FAITHFULNESS` (Ours)
- Call to Action/Decision: Joshua's call echoes down to us today. "Take careful
  heed to yourselves." This is a personal, urgent appeal. The most important
  work you will do this week is to intentionally cultivate your love for God and
  "cleave" to Him.
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `"CLEAVE to the LORD"`
  - _(Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what is one worldly
    'association' of thought or habit you will ask God for the courage to
    separate from, in order to 'cleave' more fully to Him?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: This message is not one of fear, but of sober
  reality and incredible hope. Because God IS faithful, He provides all the
  grace, all the power, and all the love needed for us to be faithful in return.
  Our part is to choose Him.
  - [EGW]: "In times of trial we must cling to God and His promises." (OHC
    312.3). Let us cling to Him now, before the final trial comes.
  - [WB]: Final Hope: `"CLING TO GOD & HIS PROMISES"`
