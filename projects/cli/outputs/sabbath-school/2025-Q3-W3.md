## Rough Start

**Overarching Theme:** The Divine Necessity of Affliction for Character
Purification and the Revelation of God's Glory **Central Focus:** Understanding
that the "rough starts" and worsening circumstances we face when following God
are often His chosen method for dismantling our self-reliance, purifying our
character, and setting the stage to reveal His supreme power for His glory and
our ultimate salvation. **Key Texts:** Exodus 5:22-23; Exodus 6:1-8; Exodus
7:3-5

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: We often believe that when we answer God's call, a door will swing open.
  But what happens when we obey, and the door slams shut in our face, and the
  walls start closing in? This was Moses' exact experience. It wasn't a sign of
  God's disapproval, but the beginning of His profound work.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we will explore a difficult but vital biblical
  truth: The Divine Purpose in the 'Rough Start'. We will see from Scripture
  that God doesn't just _allow_ trials; He _uses_ them as His primary tool for
  character restoration.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Divine Purpose in the 'Rough Start'"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: [EGW] "The Lord permits trials in order that
  we may be cleansed from earthliness, from selfishness, from harsh,
  unchristlike traits of character. He suffers the deep waters of affliction to
  go over our souls in order that we may know Him and Jesus Christ whom He has
  sent... and may come forth from the trial purer, holier, happier." (COL
  174.2). This process is not optional; it is essential for our fitness for
  heaven.
- Roadmap: We will first examine the crisis in Exodus 5—the defiance, the
  backlash, and the despair. Then, we will uncover God's profound response in
  Exodus 6 and 7, which reveals His ultimate purpose in all our trials.

### II. The Anatomy of a Crisis: When Obedience Makes Things Worse (17-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before God can demonstrate His power, the depth
  of the problem must be revealed. This involves confronting the enemy, exposing
  the weakness of our own people, and bringing the leader to the end of himself.

#### A. The Confrontation: Defiance and Despair (9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 5:1-2
        -   Reading/Context: Moses and Aaron, armed with a divine commission, deliver God's command. Pharaoh's response is immediate and absolute.
        -   [WB]: "Who is the LORD?"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Pharaoh's question is not one of genuine inquiry, but of arrogant defiance. He is saying, "Jehovah is not on my list of recognized gods. He has no jurisdiction here." This is the voice of the world, the voice of self-sufficient, rebellious humanity.
        -   [EGW]: "This is atheism, and the nation represented by Egypt would give voice to a similar denial of the claims of the living God and would manifest a like spirit of unbelief and defiance." (GC 269.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In Exodus 5:2, Pharaoh gives two reasons for his refusal. What are they, and how are they connected?" (1. "I do not know the LORD," which leads to 2. "nor will I let Israel go.")
    -   **Foundation Text 2 & 3:** Exodus 5:19-21
        -   Reading/Connection: Pharaoh doesn't just say no; he retaliates. The burden on Israel becomes unbearable. Notice who they blame.
        -   [WB]: People's Accusation -> "You have made us abhorrent"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The people, whose hopes were just raised (Ex. 4:31), now see their situation as worse than ever. Their faith, which was based on the prospect of immediate relief, evaporates in the heat of trial. They accuse God's chosen leader of being the source of their problem.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Put yourself in the place of the Israelite officers. Why is it so easy to blame leadership—in the church or in our families—when God's plan doesn't meet our expectations for speed and comfort?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* This is like a surgeon resetting a badly healed bone. The surgeon must first re-break the bone. The immediate sensation is excruciating pain, far worse than the dull ache before. A patient who doesn't trust the surgeon would scream, "You've made it worse!" But the surgeon knows this painful step is absolutely necessary for true, strong healing. God was re-breaking Israel's bondage to heal them correctly.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Exodus 5:22-23
        -   Reading/Challenge: Moses is crushed. He sees the defiance of Pharaoh and the despair of his people, and he brings his raw, honest complaint to the only One who can help.
        -   [WB]: Moses' Cry: "Why, Lord?... You have not rescued your people at all."
        -   Practical Step: Moses models something critical. He doesn't complain *about* God to the people; he complains *to* God. He takes his confusion and bitterness directly to the Source of power. This is the turning point.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Moses was brutally honest with God. How can we cultivate a relationship with God that is honest enough to ask 'Why?' but faithful enough to wait for the answer?"

### III. The Divine Response: Revelation Through Resistance (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Moses asked "Why?" God answers not with an
  explanation of the process, but with a revelation of His Person. The answer to
  our deepest trials is not a blueprint, but a Being.

#### A. The Unveiling of God's Character and Power (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 6:1
        -   Reading/Context: God's very first words to a despairing Moses are, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh." The emphasis is on *now*—the moment of greatest darkness is the moment God chooses to begin His work.
        -   [WB]: NOW you will see...
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God is saying, "The stage is finally set. The human element has failed. The enemy has shown his true colors. Your strength is gone. *Now*, My power can be displayed without any human glory."
    -   **Foundation Text 2 & 3:** Exodus 6:2-3, 6-7
        -   Reading/Connection: God doesn't just say what He will do; He declares who He is. "I am the LORD (Yahweh)." He then gives a series of powerful "I will" statements.
        -   [WB]: `I AM` -> `I WILL...` (List: Bring you out, Free you, Redeem you, Take you as My people, Be your God)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: In our trials, our greatest need is not for our circumstances to change, but for our vision of God to be clarified. God anchors Moses' faith not in a better future, but in His unchanging, all-powerful character. The covenant name Yahweh implies a personal, promise-keeping God who enters into history for His people.
        -   [EGW]: "God delivered Israel with the mighty manifestations of His power... He rescued them from their servile state, that He might bring them to a good land... He would bring them to Himself, and encircle them in His everlasting arms." (PP 334.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "God's answer to Moses' complaint in Exodus 6 is a list of promises. How does focusing on God's promises, rather than our problems, change our experience in a trial?"

#### B. The Ultimate Purpose: For His Name's Sake (8 mins)

    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine you are standing underneath a giant tapestry being woven. All you can see are chaotic knots, tangled threads, and seemingly random colors. It looks like a mess. But the Master Weaver, working from above, sees the glorious design He is creating. Our trials are the view from underneath. Faith is trusting that the Weaver knows what He is doing.
    -   **Foundation Text 4 & 5:** Exodus 7:3-5
        -   Reading/Context: God now reveals the grand strategy. "I will harden Pharaoh's heart... so that... **the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD**."
        -   [WB]: Hardened Heart -> Mighty Acts -> Egyptians Will KNOW
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The ultimate purpose of this entire "rough start" was bigger than Israel's comfort. It was for the revelation of God's character to a pagan world. Pharaoh's resistance was the black velvet on which God would display the diamond of His glory. Israel's suffering was the crucible required to make this cosmic demonstration possible.
        -   [EGW]: "It was in order that the Israelites might be a blessing to the nations, and that God's name might be made known 'throughout all the earth' (Exodus 9:16), that they were delivered from Egyptian bondage." (PK 368.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection/Application):* "Knowing that the ultimate purpose of the Exodus was for God's name to be known 'throughout all the earth,' how should this truth shape our response when our personal 'deliverance' is delayed?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that our "rough
  starts" are not accidents. They are divinely appointed. They are designed to
  expose the enemy's defiance, reveal our own weakness and impatience, and drive
  us to the end of ourselves so we can see God for who He truly is: the great "I
  AM" who "WILL" act.
- Character Focus Recap: The Bible shows that the pain of the process is
  necessary for the purity of the person. God is more interested in our
  **HOLINESS** than our immediate happiness, because our character is what we
  take to eternity.
  - [WB]: `HOLINESS > HAPPINESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: The challenge from Exodus is to **TRUST THE
  PROCESS**. When things get worse after you've tried to obey, do not retreat in
  despair. Do what Moses did: take your complaint directly to God, and then
  listen for His "I AM" and "I WILL."
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `TRUST THE WEAVER`
  - _(Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what 'rough start' in your
    life can you re-frame, not as a sign of failure, but as the stage God is
    setting for His glory?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The trials will come. The furnace is necessary.
  But the promise is sure. "Now for a little while, if need be, you have been
  grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more
  precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to
  praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 1:6-7).
  Let us trust the Refiner.
  - [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `TESTED BY FIRE` (1 Peter 1:7)
