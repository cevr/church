# 2025 Q4 W7 - November 8-14

## Ultimate Loyalty: Worship in a War Zone

**Overarching Theme:** The War Within: Conquering Self Before Conquering Canaan
**Central Focus:** True spiritual warfare is won first through the internal work
of surrender, purification, and covenant renewal. God requires our character
readiness before He grants us external victory. **Key Texts:** Joshua 5:2-9;
Joshua 8:30-35; Hebrews 10:19-22

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Imagine a commanding general, on the eve of a massive invasion, ordering
  his entire army to undergo a medical procedure that will leave them
  incapacitated for days. It sounds like strategic suicide. Yet, this is
  precisely what God commanded Joshua to do. Why?
- Theme Introduction: Today, we’ll uncover a profound biblical principle from
  the book of Joshua: the most critical battles are not fought against external
  enemies, but within our own hearts. God is more concerned with our
  **holiness** than our immediate military success. The theme is **The War
  Within: Conquering Self Before Conquering Canaan.**
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The War Within"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just ancient history. We are
  living in the final moments of the Great Controversy. Before Jesus returns, a
  people must be prepared who reflect His character perfectly. The lessons from
  Israel's entry into Canaan are end-time instructions for us on how to be
  ready.
- Roadmap: We will explore three seemingly illogical acts of worship that teach
  us how to win this internal war: the painful act of surrender, the public
  declaration of allegiance, and the deliberate centering of our lives on God's
  presence.

### II. Preparing the Heart for Battle (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before the first sword was drawn at Jericho, God
  commanded two acts that seemed to weaken Israel. They were, in fact, the very
  source of their strength. They were acts of internal preparation.

#### A. The Cut of the Covenant: Surrender Before Strength (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** **Joshua 5:2, 8**
        -   Reading/Context: "At that time the LORD said to Joshua, 'Make flint knives and circumcise the sons of Israel again the second time.' ... And so it was, when they had finished circumcising all the people, that they stayed in their places in the camp till they were healed."
        -   [WB]: Joshua 5:2 -> "Circumcise the sons of Israel"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This was a sign of the covenant (Gen. 17). The first generation had broken that covenant in the wilderness, and the sign had been suspended. Renewing it now was an act of total surrender and trust. They made themselves physically helpless, utterly dependent on God for protection from the surrounding enemies.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What was the immediate physical consequence of this command for the Israelite army?" (They became weak, vulnerable, and unable to fight.)
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** **Deuteronomy 10:16**
        -   Reading/Connection: Moses had already given the spiritual meaning: "Therefore circumcise the foreskin of your heart, and be stiff-necked no longer."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The physical act pointed to a spiritual reality. The "reproach of Egypt" (Josh. 5:9) was not just their slavery, but their slavish, worldly thinking—their love of self, their pride, their lack of faith. God was "rolling this away." For us, the "circumcision of the heart" is the cutting away of our sinful nature, our pride, and our self-reliance by the Spirit of God. This is the prerequisite for sanctification.
        -   [EGW]: "The suspension of the rite of circumcision since the rebellion at Kadesh had been a constant witness to Israel that their covenant with God, of which it was the appointed symbol, had been broken. ... Now, however, the years of rejection were ended. Once more God acknowledged Israel as His people, and the sign of the covenant was restored." (PP 485.1).
        -   [WB]: "Circumcise the heart" (Deut. 10:16) -> Cut away PRIDE / SELF
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think God demanded an act that displayed such profound vulnerability as the *first step* to conquering the land?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A patient with a life-threatening tumor cannot build up their strength to get healthy. They must first surrender to the surgeon's knife, endure the painful and weakening procedure of having the disease cut out, and only then can they begin to heal and grow strong. We cannot "get strong enough" for God; we must first surrender to the painful removal of sin from our characters.
    -   **Foundation Text 3 (Action/Promise):** **Joshua 5:9**
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Then the LORD said to Joshua, 'This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.'"
        -   Practical Step: This is God's promise. When we consent, He does the work. Our part is to surrender our will. The war within requires us to identify the "Egypt" in our hearts—the attitudes, habits, or idols we cling to—and submit them to God's knife.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What is a modern 'reproach of Egypt' in our own lives—a worldly mindset or a cherished sin—that we need to ask God, by His Spirit, to 'cut away' so we can be truly ready for His service?"

#### B. The Fuel of Faith: Remembrance Before Advance (7-8 mins) [*]

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** **Joshua 5:10** - "Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Immediately after the circumcision, while still healing, they celebrate Passover. This was an act of **remembrance**. They were looking back at God's mighty deliverance from Egypt.
        -   [WB]: Passover = Remembering God's Past Deliverance
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** **1 Corinthians 5:7** - "Therefore purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us."
        -   Deeper Insight: Passover was a memorial, but also a type pointing to Christ, the ultimate sacrifice. The "unleavened bread" symbolized a life free from the "leaven" of sin—malice and wickedness. To celebrate it meant to recommit to a pure life.
        -   [EGW]: "The use of unleavened bread also was significant. ... In like manner the leaven of sin must be put away from all who would receive life and nourishment from Christ." (PP 277.4).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does intentionally remembering God's past deliverances (in Scripture and our own lives) give us strength for present battles?"

### III. Establishing God's Rule in a War Zone (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** After the initial victories, Joshua again pauses
  the war. This time, he directs Israel's attention to establishing permanent
  symbols of God's authority and presence _in the middle of unconquered
  territory_.

#### A. The Altar of Accountability: Law and Grace Together (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Texts:** **Joshua 8:30-32, 34-35**
        -   Reading/Context: After the victory at Ai, Joshua leads Israel to Mount Ebal. "Then Joshua built an altar... an altar of whole stones... And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses... Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and the cursings..."
        -   [WB]: Draw two simple shapes: `ALTAR (Grace)` <-- next to --> `STONES (Law)`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Notice the two constructions. An **altar for sacrifices**, representing forgiveness, mercy, and grace through the blood of the coming Lamb. And a **monument of stones** with the law written on it, representing God's unchanging standard of righteousness. They are side by side.
    -   **Foundation Text:** **Deuteronomy 27:4-8**
        -   Connection: This was in direct obedience to Moses' command. Significantly, it was on Mt. Ebal, the mountain of the **curse**.
        -   Deeper Insight: Placing the altar of sacrifice on the mountain of the curse was a powerful object lesson. It declared that the only remedy for breaking the law (which brings the curse) is the atoning sacrifice. Grace does not abolish the law; it provides the solution for our transgression of it.
        -   [EGW]: "The fact that the altar was set up on Mount Ebal, the mountain upon which the curse was put, was significant, denoting that because of their transgressions of God’s law, Israel had justly incurred His wrath, and that it would be at once visited, but for the atonement of Christ, represented by the altar of sacrifice." (PP 500.2).
        -   [WB]: Under `ALTAR (Grace)` write `Atonement`. Under `STONES (Law)` write `Standard`.
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "What profound message was God sending by having the altar (grace) and the written law (standard) established together on the mountain of the curse?"
    -   **Illustration & Application:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like posting the Constitution of your new kingdom right next to the hospital you've built to heal rebellious citizens. It says, "This is the righteous standard we live by, and here is the loving provision for when you fail."
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "In our personal lives, how do we sometimes try to separate God's grace from His law? Why is it essential for our character development to keep them together?"

#### B. The Center of Existence: Placing His Presence First (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** **Joshua 18:1** - "Now the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of meeting there. And the land was subdued before them."
        -   Reading/Context: The war is not over. The text explicitly says seven tribes have not yet received their inheritance (v. 2). But Joshua **stops the process of allotting land** to set up the Sanctuary—God's dwelling place.
        -   [WB]: SHILOH -> Tabernacle (God's Presence) at the CENTER
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This act declared that God's presence was more important than possessing the land. The goal wasn't real estate; it was to be a kingdom of priests, a holy nation, with God dwelling in their midst. Worship and communion with God was the central purpose of their existence, not a secondary activity.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** **Hebrews 10:19-22**
        -   Connection: Israel had the earthly tabernacle. We have something far greater. "Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus... let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith..."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: We don't have to pause our lives to go to a physical place. Through Christ, we have constant access to the heavenly sanctuary, to the very presence of God. The principle from Joshua is this: Is communion with God through prayer and study of His word the **central, organizing principle** of your life, or is it something you fit in when your own "conquests" are done?
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The Israelites stopped dividing the land to set up the Tabernacle. What 'land-dividing'—our careers, hobbies, or ambitions—often pushes aside our time for setting up God's presence in the center of our lives?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from God's Word that true victory
  is an inside-out job. Before conquering Jericho, Israel had to surrender their
  hearts (circumcision). Before possessing the land, they had to declare their
  allegiance to God's standard of character and His provision of grace (altar
  and law). Before finishing the conquest, they had to establish His presence as
  the very center of their national life (tabernacle).
- Character Focus Recap: The battles for Canaan were a type. The true battle,
  for us, is for the perfection of character. It is the war within. Will we
  allow the Spirit to cut away our pride? Will we publicly stand for His law
  while clinging to His grace? Will we make His presence the undisputed center
  of our existence?
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `SURRENDERED HOLINESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: The call today is not to a physical knife or stone
  altar, but to a decisive spiritual act. Let us consciously choose to pause our
  own battles this week—our schedules, our worries, our ambitions—and prioritize
  the war within.
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `"SEEK FIRST"` (Matt. 6:33)
  - _(Final Question):_ Based on God's Word today, what is one "Canaanite" in
    your heart that you will surrender to God, trusting Him to fight the battle
    for you?
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Israel's story is our story. The conquest of our
  sinful hearts may seem impossible, but the Captain of the Lord's Host is with
  us. As we surrender, He will roll away our reproach, write His law on our
  hearts, and fill us with His presence, making us ready for the Heavenly
  Canaan.
  - [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS"` (Hebrews 12:2)
