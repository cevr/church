## Passover

**Overarching Theme:** Appropriating the Atonement: From Justification to
Sanctification **Central Focus:** To understand that salvation, typified by the
Passover, is a two-fold experience: divine pardon through the blood
(justification) and a personal commitment to holiness and readiness
(sanctification), which perfects our character for the final exodus. **Key
Texts:** Exodus 12:7-13, 1 Corinthians 5:7-8, Hebrews 11:28

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: On the night of the first Passover, two families could have lived
  side-by-side. Both were slaves. Both heard the same command from Moses. One
  family experienced deliverance, the other, devastating loss. What made the
  difference? It wasn't their nationality or their past deeds. It was a simple,
  yet profound, act of faith.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we're going beyond the historical story of the
  Passover to uncover its deep, personal meaning for us as end-time believers.
  The theme is **Appropriating the Atonement**. It’s not enough to know Christ
  died; we must understand how His sacrifice transforms our character today.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Appropriating the Atonement"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The Passover wasn't just about escaping
  Egypt; it was about beginning a journey toward the Promised Land. For us,
  salvation isn't just about escaping hell; it's about God restoring His
  character in us so we are fit for heaven and ready for Christ's soon return.
- Roadmap: We will explore two critical phases of this process, mirrored in the
  Passover service: first, the **Divine Provision** of the blood for our pardon,
  and second, our **Required Participation** in holiness and readiness.

### II. The Divine Provision: Covered by the Blood (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The foundation of our hope is not in what we do,
  but in what God has done. The first step in salvation is accepting God's
  provision. For Israel, this was symbolized by the blood of the lamb.

#### A. The Lamb Slain and Applied (8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 12:5-7
        -   Reading/Context: God gives a precise command: select a lamb "without blemish," kill it, and then—critically—*apply* its blood to the doorposts.
        -   [WB]: Verse Ref: Ex. 12:7 / Keywords: "TAKE THE BLOOD...STRIKE IT ON THE DOORPOSTS"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The slaying of the lamb represents the historical fact of Christ's death on the cross. But a slain lamb in the pen saved no one. The life-saving power was in the **personal application** of that blood. This is faith—not just mental agreement, but an active appropriation of Christ's sacrifice for *me*.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "Why do you think God insisted the blood be placed visibly on the *outside* of the house, not just kept in a basin inside?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 5:7
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul makes the connection explicit: "For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us." The type meets the antitype. The entire sacrificial system pointed to this one great event.
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Lamb -> (points to) -> CHRIST OUR PASSOVER
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Our salvation begins with a transaction that happens entirely outside of ourselves. We are declared righteous (justified) not because we are good, but because we are covered by the merits of Christ's blood. This is the starting point of all true character transformation.
        -   [EGW]: "It was not enough that the paschal lamb be slain; its blood must be sprinkled upon the doorposts; so the merits of Christ's blood must be applied to the soul. We must believe, not only that He died for the world, but that He died for us individually. We must appropriate to ourselves the virtue of the atoning sacrifice." (PP 277).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "The quote says we must believe Christ died 'for us individually.' How does one move from knowing about the cross as a historical event to appropriating it as a personal reality?"

#### B. The Promise of the Blood (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 12:13
        -   Reading/Context: Here is the promise and the principle of the judgment: "And when I see the blood, I will pass over you." God's gaze was not fixed on the sinners within the house, but on the blood outside.
        -   [WB]: Promise: "WHEN I SEE THE BLOOD, I WILL PASS OVER YOU."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Our security for eternity does not rest on our performance, our feelings, or our level of sanctification. It rests solely on the blood of Jesus. The destroying angel did not ask, "Are the people inside worthy?" He only looked for the token of the blood. This is justification by faith.
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a king issues a pardon for a condemned prisoner. The pardon is written, signed, and sealed. It is a legal fact. But it has no effect until the prisoner reaches out his hand and *accepts* the document. Applying the blood is accepting the pardon. Our faith is the hand that receives what Christ's blood has already secured.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Hebrews 11:28
        -   Reading/Challenge: "By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, lest he who destroyed the firstborn should touch them." The great "faith chapter" identifies this act—sprinkling the blood—as the pinnacle of faith. It was an act of absolute trust in God's word against all sight and reason.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What 'destroying angels'—fear, guilt, condemnation—do we face today from which only a constant focus on the blood of Christ can deliver us?"

### III. Required Participation: The Feast and the Flight (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Being pardoned is not the end of the story; it's
  the beginning. God saved Israel _from_ Egypt so He could make them a holy
  people _for_ Himself. The blood deals with our past (justification); the feast
  and the flight deal with our present and future (sanctification and
  readiness).

#### A. Purging the Leaven (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 12:15, 17
        -   Reading/Context: The command is just as serious as applying the blood: for seven days, they must eat unleavened bread. All leaven (yeast) had to be diligently removed from their homes. This was not optional.
        -   [WB]: Command: "PUT AWAY LEAVEN" -> "EAT UNLEAVENED BREAD"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Leaven in Scripture is a consistent symbol of sin, corruption, pride, and false doctrine. It puffs up and spreads silently until it corrupts the whole lump. Being covered by the blood means we now have a new master and a new life. We are called to actively cooperate with God in purging sin from our lives.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 5:8
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul again explains the spiritual meaning: "Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...leaven of malice and wickedness..." vs. "...sincerity and truth."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the work of sanctification. It is the daily, moment-by-moment choice to turn from sin and feed our souls on Christ, who is the true "unleavened bread." This process perfects our character, making us like Him.
        -   [EGW]: "In like manner the leaven of sin must be put away from all who would receive life and nourishment from Christ." (PP 278).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection/Application):* "Paul connects 'malice and wickedness' with leaven. What are some subtle forms of 'leaven'—like wrong attitudes, hidden pride, or cherished sins—that we might overlook in our 'houses' (our hearts)?"

#### B. Eating in Readiness (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 12:8, 11
        -   Reading/Context: They were to eat the lamb—roasted with fire—along with bitter herbs. And notice the posture: "with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it in haste."
        -   [WB]: Posture: LOINS GIRDED, SHOES ON, STAFF IN HAND
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This was not a relaxed, leisurely meal. It was the meal of a people on the move. They were pilgrims, ready for the trumpet call to leave Egypt forever. The bitter herbs reminded them of the bitterness of their past bondage to sin. Roasting with fire speaks of the trials and refining that are part of the Christian experience.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* This is like a special forces team behind enemy lines. They eat, but they are fully dressed, gear packed, weapon in hand, listening for the signal for extraction. They are in the world, but they are not of it, and they are ready to leave at a moment's notice.
        -   [EGW]: "They had a part to act themselves, and by their acts to manifest their faith in the provision made for their salvation." (ARSH 12-31-72).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The Israelites had to eat in readiness to *leave* Egypt. What does it mean for us to live in a state of spiritual readiness to *leave* this world for our heavenly home? What practical things might need to change in our lives?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that the Passover
  teaches a complete salvation. It begins with God's gracious provision—the
  blood of Christ that covers our sin and justifies us by faith. But it
  continues with our required participation—the purging of sin and living a life
  of holy readiness, feeding on Christ daily.
- Character Focus Recap: God is not just saving us _from_ sin's penalty, He is
  saving us _from_ sin's power. He is calling us to a character of "sincerity
  and truth," fit for the kingdom of heaven.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `HOLINESS` & `READINESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: Have we been content to know the lamb was slain, but
  have neglected to apply the blood daily? Have we claimed the pardon, but
  failed to purge the leaven from our hearts? God calls us to the full
  experience.
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword from Scripture: `"KEEP THE FEAST"` (1 Cor. 5:8)
  - _(Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what is one piece of
    'leaven' you will ask the Holy Spirit to help you purge from your life this
    week, so you can more fully feast on Christ?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The command to Israel was to be ready, for the
  deliverance came at midnight. We too are told the Son of Man comes at an hour
  we do not expect. Let us, by faith, be found with our sins covered by His
  blood and our characters reflecting His purity, "looking for the blessed hope
  and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ."
  - [WB]: Final Verse Ref: `Titus 2:13` / Hope Phrase:
    `"LOOKING FOR THE BLESSED HOPE"`
