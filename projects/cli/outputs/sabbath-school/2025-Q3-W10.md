## The Covenant and the Blueprint

**Overarching Theme:** The Divine Pattern for Human Transformation **Central
Focus:** Understanding that God's covenant and sanctuary blueprint are not just
historical accounts, but are His eternal, practical method for restoring His own
character in us, making us fit for His presence. **Key Texts:** Exodus 24:3, 7;
Ezekiel 36:26-27; Exodus 25:8-9

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: "Have you ever made a promise to God, with all sincerity, saying 'This
  time, I will not fail'... only to find yourself failing again?" This
  experience of Israel in Exodus is our own story. It reveals a profound truth
  about ourselves and an even more profound truth about God's solution.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we're going beyond the stone tablets and acacia
  wood. We will discover God's **divine pattern for human transformation**. This
  isn't just about a covenant made thousands of years ago; it's about the
  blueprint God has for rebuilding His character perfectly in you and me.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Divine Pattern for Transformation"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding this pattern is not optional;
  it is the very heart of sanctification. It is God's method for preparing a
  people who can stand in His presence when He returns. Our readiness depends on
  it.
- Roadmap: We will first examine the covenant promise and the human dilemma it
  reveals. Then, we will explore God's incredible solution—the blueprint for not
  just a building, but for a new heart and a new life.

### II. The Covenant's Demand and The Heart's Deficit (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** At Sinai, God formalizes His relationship with
  Israel. In their response, we see both a noble desire and a critical
  misunderstanding of their own ability, which is the starting point for true
  conversion.

#### A. The Sincere Vow and The Stony Reality (9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 24:3, 7
        -   Reading/Context: Moses comes down from the mountain with God's laws. He recites them, and the people make a solemn, unified promise—twice.
        -   [WB]: `Exodus 24:3, 7` -> "All the words... we will do."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This was a sincere, heartfelt declaration. They *wanted* to obey. This is the first step in any relationship with God: the alignment of our will with His. They chose God as their King.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In Exodus 24, what two things did the people commit to? (v. 3 'do', v. 7 'be obedient'). What's the difference between doing and being?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 24:19
        -   Reading/Connection: Centuries later, Joshua gives the people a reality check that echoes back to Sinai: "You are not able to serve the LORD. For He is a holy God..." This wasn't to discourage them, but to point them away from self-reliance.
        -   [WB]: `Joshua 24:19` -> "You are NOT ABLE..."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The people at Sinai didn't understand their own hearts. They had the will, but not the power. Their hearts were, as the prophets would later say, "hearts of stone"—incapable of producing the righteousness God's holy law required. This is the fundamental human problem.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think God accepted their promise in Exodus 24, knowing, as Joshua later states, that they were unable to keep it on their own?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a person with a fatal heart condition promising a doctor they will run a marathon. The desire is good, but the capacity is absent. They don't need a better training plan; they need a heart transplant. Our promises to God, without His divine intervention, are just like that.
        -   Connecting to Life: We often think our spiritual problem is a lack of effort. The Bible teaches our problem is a lack of life, a heart condition that only the Divine Surgeon can heal.

#### B. The Divine Transplant: God's Promised Solution (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Ezekiel 36:26-27
        -   Reading/Context: Here is God's explicit answer to the problem revealed at Sinai. He doesn't just command; He promises to enable. Notice the "I will" statements.
        -   [WB]: `Ezekiel 36:26-27` -> "I will give... I will put... I will cause you to walk..."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God promises to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. He will perform the heart surgery—He removes the "stony heart" of self-will and inability, and gives a "heart of flesh" that is soft, alive, and responsive to His Spirit. He then puts His Spirit *within* us to be the power source for obedience.
        -   [EGW]: "In the heart renewed by divine grace, love is the principle of action. It modifies the character, governs the impulses, controls the passions, subdues enmity, and ennobles the affections. This love, cherished in the soul, sweetens the life and sheds a refining influence on all around." (SC 59).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Ezekiel 36 promises a 'new heart.' In practical terms, what does a 'heart of stone' feel like in your daily spiritual life (e.g., prayer is a chore, Bible is dry, resentment is easy), and what would a 'heart of flesh' look like?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** 2 Corinthians 12:9-10
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul understood this principle perfectly. He learned that acknowledging his weakness was the prerequisite for receiving God's power.
        -   Practical Step: True obedience begins not with the vow "I will," but with the confession "I cannot, but You can." It is a moment-by-moment surrender of our weakness in exchange for His strength. This is the essence of the covenant relationship God desires.

### III. The Blueprint for Transformation: Living in His Presence (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** God didn't just promise a new heart; He gave
  Israel a visual, tangible lesson plan for how this transformation would
  happen. The Sanctuary was the blueprint for salvation and sanctification.

#### A. The Pattern of His Presence (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 25:8-9
        -   Reading/Context: After the covenant is made, God's very next major instruction is this. Notice His primary motive.
        -   [WB]: `Exodus 25:8` -> "Let them make Me a sanctuary; that I may DWELL among them."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's ultimate desire is not just our obedience, but our fellowship. He wants to live with us! The entire plan of salvation is about restoring this broken fellowship. The sanctuary was the means to do this safely, where a holy God could dwell among a sinful people.
        -   [EGW]: "So to Israel, whom He desired to make His dwelling place, He revealed His glorious ideal of character. The pattern was shown them in the mount when the law was given from Sinai and when God passed by before Moses and proclaimed, 'The Lord, The Lord God, merciful and gracious...'" (Ed 36).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "According to Exodus 25:9, what was Moses required to base the sanctuary construction on? What does this tell us about the origin of the plan?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* An architect provides a master builder with a detailed blueprint. The builder's job is not to invent or alter the design, but to follow the pattern with precision to achieve the architect's beautiful and functional vision. God is the Architect of our character; His Word is the blueprint. We must not deviate from His plan.
        -   Connecting to Life: The sanctuary services, the furniture, the layout—it was all a pattern of Christ's work. It taught that access to God's presence is only through the blood of the Lamb, and life in His presence is a life of holiness.

#### B. The Power of His Spirit [*] (7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 31:1-6
        -   Reading/Connection: God not only gives the blueprint, He provides the power and skill to carry it out. This is the first explicit mention in the Bible of someone being "filled with the Spirit of God."
        -   [WB]: `Exodus 31:3` -> "Filled with the Spirit of God" -> Wisdom, Understanding, Skill
        -   Deeper Insight: God equipped Bezalel with supernatural ability for a "practical" task. This teaches us that there is no division between sacred and secular work when it is done for God's glory. Whether preaching, healing, or crafting with excellence, it is the Spirit of God that provides the power.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does the story of Bezalel challenge the idea that only pastors or evangelists have 'spiritual gifts'? What 'practical' skill might God want to fill with His Spirit in your life for His glory?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3 & 4:** Exodus 31:13 & 1 Corinthians 3:16-17
        -   Reading/Connection: God connects the Sabbath sign directly to this work, calling it a sign that "I am the LORD who sanctifies you." Paul brings the blueprint to its ultimate fulfillment: **WE** are the temple.
        -   [WB]: `Ex. 31:13` -> Sabbath = Sign of Sanctification. `1 Cor. 3:16` -> "You ARE the temple of God."
        -   Practical Step: The entire blueprint of the sanctuary—the cleansing, the atonement, the light, the bread of presence, the law within, the glory of God dwelling there—is God's pattern for **your life**. Keeping the Sabbath is a weekly acceptance of His sanctifying work, a recognition that He is the one building us into a holy temple.

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We saw from Scripture that our most sincere
  promises to obey are useless without a divine heart transplant. We saw that
  God's solution, beautifully illustrated in the sanctuary blueprint, is for His
  holy presence and Spirit to dwell **within us**.
- Character Focus Recap: The purpose of the covenant, the law, and the sanctuary
  was to produce a holy people, a people transformed into God's own likeness.
  This is God's high and holy calling for us today, as the final generation.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `HOLINESS` (A heart in harmony with God)
- Call to Action/Decision: The question is not "Will you try harder?" but "Will
  you surrender more completely?" Will you lay your stony, self-reliant heart on
  the altar and allow the Divine Architect to rebuild you according to His
  perfect, heavenly pattern?
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `SURRENDER`
  - _(Final Question):_ "Based on God's blueprint for your life, what is one
    area of 'construction'—one character trait—you will specifically ask the
    Holy Spirit to take over this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The sanctuary on earth is gone, but Christ is
  ministering in the true tabernacle in heaven. And He is working to make each
  of us a living temple, fit for eternity. Let us cooperate with Him.
  - [EGW]: "The only safeguard against evil is the indwelling of Christ in the
    heart through faith in His righteousness... As the Holy Spirit glorifies
    Christ, our hearts are softened and subdued, the temptation loses its power,
    and the grace of Christ transforms the character." (MB 118).
  - [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `CHRIST IN YOU, THE HOPE OF GLORY` (Col. 1:27)
