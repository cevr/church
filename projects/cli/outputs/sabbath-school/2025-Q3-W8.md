# 2025 Q3 W8 - August 16-22

## Covenant at Sinai

**Overarching Theme:** The Law: God's Character Revealed, Our Character Restored
**Central Focus:** To understand that the Law given at Sinai is not merely a set
of rules, but a transcript of God's holy character, designed to reveal our
profound need for Christ and to serve as the blueprint for our restoration into
His image. **Key Texts:** Exodus 19:4-6, Exodus 20:1-2, Romans 7:12, James
1:23-25

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: When God rescued Israel from Egypt, where was He taking them? The
  immediate answer is "the Promised Land." But God's own answer in Exodus 19:4
  is different and far more profound. He says, "I... brought you to **Myself**."
  The goal was never just a location; it was a relationship. It was
  transformation.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we will explore the Covenant at Sinai not as the
  giving of a legal code, but as a divine revelation. We will see the Law as a
  perfect picture of God's own character, given to show us both His holiness and
  our desperate need for a Savior to restore that character in us.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Law: God's Character Revealed, Our
    Character Restored"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding this is critical for us today.
  We are living in the antitypical Day of Atonement, a time of judgment when
  character is being weighed. We must have characters that reflect God's law,
  not by our own power, but by having it written on our hearts by Christ. This
  is our preparation for eternity.
- Roadmap: We will first revisit the awesome scene at Sinai to understand the
  holiness of God's character. Then, we will examine the Law itself as a
  standard of righteousness that drives us to the grace of Christ for true
  transformation.

### II. The Awesome Revelation of a Holy Character (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before God spoke a single commandment, He
  established the **context**. The manner in which the law was given is as
  important as the law itself. It reveals the nature of the Lawgiver and the
  sacredness of His standard.

#### A. The Invitation and Preparation (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 19:4-6
        -   Reading/Context: "You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself. Now therefore, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to Me... a kingdom of priests and a holy nation."
        -   [WB]: Exodus 19:4 "Brought you to **MYSELF**"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's first move is always grace. He reminds them of their salvation ("I bore you on eagles' wings") before He mentions obedience. The goal is intimacy ("to Myself") and purpose ("kingdom of priests, holy nation"). They were to be representatives of His character to the world.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In these verses, what comes first: God's act of salvation or His call to obedience? What does this order teach us about the nature of our relationship with Him?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 19:10-11, 16
        -   Reading/Connection: God commands them to consecrate themselves, wash their clothes, and prepare for the third day, for "the LORD will come down... in the sight of all the people." This preparation culminates in "thunderings and lightnings, and a thick cloud on the mountain."
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Mountain with cloud/lightning -> People at a distance. Arrow: REVERENCE & HOLINESS.
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This wasn't arbitrary. The external cleansing (washing clothes) was to symbolize the internal purity required to stand in the presence of a holy God. The awesome display was to impress upon them the infinite holiness of God and the sacredness of His law, which is a transcript of His character.
        -   [EGW]: "God purposed to make the occasion of speaking His law a scene of awful grandeur, in keeping with its exalted character. The people were to be impressed that everything connected with the service of God must be regarded with the greatest reverence." (PP 303.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think such dramatic displays were necessary? In our modern, casual culture, how can we cultivate this same sense of reverence for God and His holy standard?"

#### B. The Purpose of Holy Fear (7-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 20:18-20
        -   Reading/Context: The people are terrified and stand afar off, asking Moses to speak to them instead of God. Moses replies, "Do not fear; for God has come to test you, and that **His fear may be before your faces, so that you may not sin**."
        -   [WB]: Exodus 20:20 "God has come... that you may not sin."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is a crucial distinction. There is a paralyzing fear that drives us *from* God, and a reverential fear that drives us *from sin*. God's goal was the latter. A true sight of His majesty and holiness is the most powerful motive against transgression. It re-calibrates our desires.
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Imagine a world-renowned surgeon about to perform a life-saving heart operation. The room is sterile, everyone is hushed, every instrument is precise. There's a solemn reverence because a life is at stake. God was about to perform spiritual heart surgery on a nation, giving them the principles of eternal life. The reverence wasn't to scare them away, but to show them the infinite importance and sanctity of what He was doing for them.*
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Hebrews 12:28-29
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may serve God acceptably with **reverence and godly fear**. For our God is a consuming fire."
        -   Practical Step: The New Testament confirms this principle. Grace does not lead to casualness; it leads to deeper reverence! This "godly fear" is the foundation of a character that can stand in the last days. It is the beginning of wisdom.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Thinking about the surgeon illustration, how does viewing God's law with this kind of 'reverential fear' change our attitude toward obedience from a burden to a blessing?"

### III. The Standard that Reveals Our Need for a Savior (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Now we look at the content of the law. We will
  see that it begins with grace, functions as a perfect mirror, and ultimately
  points us to the only solution for our sin-sick characters: the righteousness
  of Christ.

#### A. The Foundation of Grace and the Function of the Mirror (8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 20:1-2
        -   Reading/Context: "And God spoke all these words, saying: 'I am the LORD your God, who **brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage**.'"
        -   [WB]: Exodus 20:2 "I AM... who brought you out" (GRACE before COMMAND)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The Ten Commandments do not begin with "Thou shalt not." They begin with a declaration of relationship and redemption. Obedience is the **response** to salvation, not the means of earning it. This is the gospel framework for the law.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** James 1:23-25
        -   Reading/Connection: James compares the one who hears the law and doesn't obey to a man who "observes his natural face in a mirror... and immediately forgets what kind of man he was."
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Mirror (Law) -> shows "SIN" (character defect) -> points to -> Cross (Cleansing)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the primary function of the law for the sinner. It is a perfect diagnostic tool. It shows us the "dirt" on our character—the selfishness, the pride, the idolatry. It reveals our terminal condition of sin.
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *You're about to leave for an important appointment. You feel fine. But a loved one says, "You might want to look in the mirror." You look and see a smudge of dirt on your cheek. Were you angry at the mirror? Of course not! You were grateful. But you didn't try to rub your face with the mirror to get clean. You went to the sink for water and soap. The law is that loving, perfect mirror. It shows us our sin, for which we should be grateful, so that we will run to the fountain of Christ's blood for cleansing.*
    -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "Based on the mirror analogy, what is the one thing the law, by itself, can never do for us?"

#### B. The Impossibility of Self-Righteousness and the Provision of Christ's Righteousness [*] (7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Romans 3:20
        -   Reading/Context: "Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for **by the law is the knowledge of sin**."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Paul confirms the mirror principle. The law's purpose is not to justify us, but to give us the "knowledge of sin." It shuts every mouth and proves the whole world guilty before God (Rom 3:19).
        -   [EGW]: "The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own hearts, and that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep God's law; and they readily entered into covenant with God. Feeling that they were able to establish their own righteousness, they declared, 'All that the Lord hath said will we do, and be obedient.'" (PP 371.2).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...impossible... without Christ..."
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "The Israelites quickly failed after their confident promise. How do we, today, make that same mistake of relying on our own ability to be good?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4 & 5:** Romans 3:21-24 & Psalm 40:8
        -   Reading/Challenge: "But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed... through faith in Jesus Christ" (Rom 3:21-22). This was the Messiah's own experience: "I delight to do Your will, O my God, and Your law is within my heart" (Ps 40:8).
        -   [WB]: Two Tablets: Stone (External) -> Heart (Internal - Ps 40:8)
        -   Practical Step: The solution is not to abolish the standard, but to have a heart transplant! This is the New Covenant promise. We stop trying to establish our own righteousness and accept Christ's. He not only pardons our past transgressions but, through the Holy Spirit, writes the principles of the law—His character—upon our hearts.
        -   [EGW]: "The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone is written by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going about to establish our own righteousness we accept the righteousness of Christ." (PP 371.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "When the 'mirror' of the law shows you a flaw this week, what does it look like, practically, to 'accept the righteousness of Christ' for that issue instead of just trying harder?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that the event at
  Sinai was a revelation of God's holy character. The law is His perfect
  standard, beginning with grace, acting as a mirror to show us our sin, and
  driving us to the only solution: Christ.
- Character Focus Recap: The high calling to be a "holy nation" has not been
  lowered. The standard of character required to stand before a holy God is
  still His perfect law. But the glorious promise of the gospel is that what the
  law demands, Christ provides.
  - [WB]: Key Character Trait: `HOLINESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: The great struggle of the Christian life is to cease
  from our own works and to allow Christ to work in us. The call today is to
  surrender our self-sufficient efforts to keep the law and to plead for the
  fulfillment of the new covenant promise: that God would write His law, His
  character, in our hearts.
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword from Scripture: `"ABIDE"` (John 15:4)
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one area of
    your character will you specifically surrender to Christ, asking Him to
    write His law there?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Israel failed because they looked at themselves.
  Our only hope is to look away from self and to the Savior. He is the living
  embodiment of the law. In Him, we find both pardon for our failures and power
  for a life of loving obedience, fitting us for His soon return.
  - [WB]: Final Hope phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS"` (Hebrews 12:2)
