# Bible Study: The Sabbath—Creation Gift, Covenant Sign, and End-Time Witness

## 1) Biblical Foundation: What is the Sabbath?

- God created and blessed the seventh day at Creation, before sin, before Jews
  and Gentiles existed.
  - Genesis 2:1-3 — God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day.
- The Sabbath is part of the Ten Commandments, the moral law written by God’s
  own finger.
  - Exodus 20:8-11 — “Remember the Sabbath day… the seventh day is the Sabbath
    of the LORD your God.”
  - Deuteronomy 5:12-15 — Sabbath is tied to redemption: “remember that you were
    a slave… therefore… keep the Sabbath.”
- The Sabbath is a covenant sign between God and His people, blessing all who
  keep it.
  - Exodus 31:13, 16-17; Ezekiel 20:12, 20 — a sign that He sanctifies His
    people.
  - Isaiah 56:2-7 — foreigners who keep the Sabbath are welcomed to God’s house.
- Jesus kept the Sabbath and taught its true meaning.
  - Luke 4:16; Mark 2:27-28 — “The Sabbath was made for man… the Son of Man is
    Lord also of the Sabbath.”
  - Matthew 12:1-12 — works of mercy are lawful on the Sabbath.

[DYK🔎] The fourth commandment explicitly includes “the stranger within your
gates” (Exodus 20:10), showing from Sinai forward the Sabbath was never intended
only for ethnic Israel.

Thesis: The seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday) is God’s creation gift and a
perpetual moral command, not abolished at the cross nor changed by apostolic
authority. It remains a delight and sign of sanctification for all believers in
Christ.

## 2) Jesus, the Cross, and the Sabbath

- Jesus affirmed the perpetuity of the moral law.
  - Matthew 5:17-19 — He did not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill
    (establish its true intent).
  - Romans 3:31 — “Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid.”
- Jesus died, and His followers still rested on the Sabbath “according to the
  commandment.”
  - Luke 23:54-56; 24:1 — disciples kept Sabbath after the crucifixion;
    resurrection occurs “the first day of the week.”
- The New Covenant puts God’s law into the heart.
  - Jeremiah 31:31-33; Hebrews 8:10; 10:16 — the same moral law is internalized,
    not discarded.

[DYK🔎] The one weekly memorial God sanctified at Creation is the seventh day.
The memorials of Christ’s death and resurrection are not weekly days, but the
Lord’s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:23-26; Luke 22:19) and baptism (Romans 6:3-5;
Colossians 2:12).

## 3) Was the Sabbath Abolished or “Nailed to the Cross”?

- Colossians 2:14-17 speaks of the “handwriting of ordinances” and shadows
  pointing forward to Christ.
  - The “certificate of debt” (cheirographon) and “decrees” (dogmasin) align
    with the ceremonial ordinances connected to sacrifices and feast regulations
    (cf. Ephesians 2:15).
  - The triad “festival, new moon, Sabbaths” mirrors Israel’s annual, monthly,
    and ceremonial sabbaths (cf. Hosea 2:11; 1 Chronicles 23:31).
  - Leviticus 23 distinguishes between the weekly Sabbath and festival sabbaths:
    “These are the feasts… besides the Sabbaths of the LORD” (Leviticus
    23:37-38). The weekly Sabbath is a creation memorial (backward-looking), not
    a shadow of things to come (forward-looking).
- The Ten Commandments were placed inside the ark (Exodus 25:16; Deuteronomy
  10:2-5). The book of Moses’ ordinances—ceremonial laws—was placed beside the
  ark (Deuteronomy 31:26), highlighting a biblical distinction.

Conclusion: The cross ended the ceremonial system that foreshadowed Christ. The
moral law—including the seventh-day Sabbath—remains.

## 4) Is the Sabbath Only for Jews?

- Creation origin: given to humanity, not to one nation (Genesis 2:1-3; Mark
  2:27).
- Inclusive command: “the stranger within your gates” (Exodus 20:10).
- Prophetic promise: foreigners who “keep the Sabbath” are gathered to God’s
  house (Isaiah 56:2-7).
- End-time view: in the new earth, “from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall
  come to worship” (Isaiah 66:22-23).

[Q] “But isn’t the Sabbath called a sign between God and Israel?” Yes (Exodus
31:13), because Israel was God’s covenant people. In Christ, Gentiles are
grafted in (Romans 11:17-24; Ephesians 2:12-19), becoming partakers of the same
covenant blessings—including the sign He gave to sanctify His people.

## 5) Is Jesus Our Rest—So Do We Still Keep a Day?

- Jesus invites us to rest in Him daily (Matthew 11:28-30)—a continual
  heart-rest from sin and self.
- Hebrews 4 connects:
  - God’s Creation rest (Hebrews 4:4; Genesis 2:2),
  - the faith-rest believers enter now (Hebrews 4:3),
  - and a remaining Sabbath-keeping for God’s people (Hebrews 4:9).
- The Greek word in Hebrews 4:9 is “sabbatismos,” meaning a Sabbath-keeping.

[DYK🔎] “Sabbatismos” occurs here uniquely in the New Testament and means the
practice of Sabbath-keeping, indicating that, alongside spiritual rest in
Christ, a Sabbath observance remains.

Conclusion: Christ is our Rest—and He leads us to honor the weekly Sabbath as a
sign of that rest (Hebrews 4:9-10).

## 6) Did the Day Change to Sunday Because of the Resurrection?

- New Testament “first day” texts never command a change of the Sabbath.
  - John 20:19 — meeting behind closed doors for fear, not a stated worship
    institution.
  - Acts 20:7 — a night meeting (context suggests Saturday night, the first day
    beginning at sundown), with Paul traveling on the next day (v. 13), not
    treating it as sacred rest.
  - 1 Corinthians 16:2 — laying aside offerings at home (implied), a practical
    instruction for travel efficiency, not a command to assemble weekly on
    Sunday.
- Scripture’s memorials of resurrection and death are baptism and the Lord’s
  Supper (Romans 6:3-5; 1 Corinthians 11:26), not a changed weekly day.
- The “Lord’s day” (Revelation 1:10) is not identified there as Sunday. Jesus is
  “Lord of the Sabbath” (Mark 2:28), and God calls the Sabbath “my holy day”
  (Isaiah 58:13).

[Q] “Wouldn’t Sunday be appropriate since Jesus rose that day?” The resurrection
is central, and the Bible gives us clear memorials for it (baptism). But there
is no biblical authorization to alter the day God blessed at Creation. Ascension
and crucifixion are likewise vital, yet God did not institute weekly memorial
days for them.

## 7) How Did Sunday Observance Arise Historically?

- Prophecy foretold a power would “think to change times and laws” (Daniel
  7:25).
- Early centuries show tension and gradual shift:
  - Christians (Jew and Gentile) are found attending synagogue/assembly on
    Sabbaths (Acts 13:42-44; 16:13; 17:2; 18:4,11).
  - Over time, some Christians gathered on the first day in honor of the
    resurrection alongside Sabbath-keeping.
- Civil and ecclesiastical steps:
  - A.D. 321: Constantine’s Sunday edict mandated rest in cities on “the
    venerable day of the Sun.”
  - A.D. 363/364: Council of Laodicea (Canon 29) discouraged Sabbath rest
    (“Judaizing”) and promoted Sunday. These are historical developments, not
    apostolic commands.

[DYK🔎] In dozens of languages (e.g., Spanish sábado, Italian sabato, Russian
суббота), the word for Saturday still derives from “Sabbath,” preserving ancient
recognition of the seventh day.

## 8) Is the Sabbath Binding on Christians?

- The New Testament upholds the commandments as the standard of love (Romans
  13:8-10; 1 John 5:2-3).
- James 2:8-12 treats the Decalogue as a unit of moral law by which we will be
  judged.
- Revelation presents a last-day people who “keep the commandments of God and
  the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12; cf. 12:17).

[Q] “Did Paul say all days are alike (Romans 14:5-6)?” The context is eating and
fasting preferences (Romans 14:2-6). Paul deals with disputable matters, not the
Ten Commandments. He never licenses idolatry, dishonor of parents, adultery, or
Sabbath-breaking.

## 9) How Do We Keep the Sabbath? Is it Restrictive?

Principles from Scripture:

- Holy rest and worship:
  - Exodus 20:8-11 — cease from ordinary labor.
  - Isaiah 58:13-14 — turn from personal business and find delight in God.
  - Leviticus 23:3 — “holy convocation” (gathered worship).
  - Luke 4:16; Acts 13, 15, 18 — assembling for Scripture and fellowship.
  - Psalm 92 — a psalm for the Sabbath day (praise, gratitude).
- Works of mercy, necessity, and ministry:
  - Matthew 12:1-12; John 5:17 — relieving suffering, saving life, doing good.
- Guard the gate of commerce:
  - Nehemiah 13:15-22; Jeremiah 17:21-27 — refrain from buying/selling and
    weekday business.
- Prepare before Sabbath:
  - Exodus 16:23-30 — prepare food and tasks ahead when possible, to free the
    day for rest and worship.

What it can look like:

- Welcome the Sabbath at sundown with prayer and song (Genesis 1:5; Mark 1:32).
- Attend corporate worship and Bible study; share testimonies and praise.
- Family worship; nature walks to contemplate the Creator (Psalm 19; Romans
  1:20).
- Acts of compassion: visit the sick, encourage the lonely, practical kindness.
- Unhurried time in Scripture and prayer; teach children Bible stories and God’s
  works.

Is it restrictive?

- God calls it a delight (Isaiah 58:13-14). He frees us from the tyranny of
  endless labor and commerce.
- The Sabbath is not a fence to keep joy out; it is a garden in time where joy
  can grow.

[Q] “I work essential services—what then?” Jesus affirmed works of necessity and
mercy (Matthew 12:11-12). Do what must be done to preserve life and serve
others, while protecting the sacred rest as far as possible and seeking
schedules that honor God.

## 10) Present Truth: Sabbath in Earth’s Final Message

- The first angel calls us to “worship Him who made heaven, earth, sea, and
  springs of water” (Revelation 14:7), echoing the Sabbath commandment wording
  (Exodus 20:11).
- The final conflict centers on worship and obedience (Revelation 13–14). God’s
  remnant are identified as those who keep His commandments and the faith of
  Jesus (Revelation 14:12).
- The Sabbath, as the Creator’s sign, stands as a simple, living confession:
  Jesus is my Maker, Redeemer, and Lord.

[Q] “Isn’t emphasizing the Sabbath legalistic?” Legalism is seeking acceptance
with God through our performance. The Sabbath is the opposite: it teaches us to
stop working to earn, and rest in God’s finished work (Hebrews 4:10), expressing
love through willing obedience (John 14:15).

[DYK🔎] Hebrews 4:10 says the believer “has ceased from his works as God did
from His.” God’s “ceasing” was not idleness but joyful completion and communion.
Sabbath rest celebrates Christ’s finished redemption and anticipates the new
creation.

## Conclusion

Jesus, Lord of the Sabbath, invites His end-time people back to the rest He
blessed at Creation, sealed at Sinai, honored in His life, respected by His
disciples after the cross, and promised for the new earth. The Bible gives no
command to change the day to Sunday; instead, it points to a people who, by
grace, keep God’s commandments and the faith of Jesus.

### Key Takeaways:

1. Truth: The seventh-day Sabbath is a creation ordinance and moral
   command—never abolished or changed by Scripture (Genesis 2:1-3; Exodus
   20:8-11; Matthew 5:17-19; Hebrews 4:9).
2. Application: Keep the Sabbath as a delight—rest from secular work, assemble
   for worship, do good, and deepen communion with God (Isaiah 58:13-14; Matthew
   12:12).
3. Growth: Seek Jesus’ rest daily and honor His holy day weekly; teach it to
   your family; arrange your life to reflect worship of the Creator and Redeemer
   (Deuteronomy 6:6-9; Revelation 14:7,12).

“Blessed is the man… who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps his hand
from doing any evil” (Isaiah 56:2).
