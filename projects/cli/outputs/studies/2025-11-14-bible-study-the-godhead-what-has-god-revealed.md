# Bible Study: The Godhead – What Has God Revealed?

> “The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever…”
> — Deuteronomy 29:29

## Introduction – A Centrist, Scripture-First Approach

Thesis:
The Bible reveals **one God** who is manifested as **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**. These three are distinct in personhood and function, yet united in nature, purpose, and authority. Where Scripture is clear, we may speak with confidence. Where Scripture is silent or mysterious, we must be reverent and cautious.

We will focus on:

1. What does the Bible plainly reveal about:
   - The **oneness** of God?
   - The **Father**, the **Son**, and the **Holy Spirit**?
2. What can we infer (carefully) about their relationship?
3. Is the Holy Spirit a **person**, or simply a power/force?
4. What is the **role and function** of each?

We will try to avoid forcing Trinitarian or anti‑Trinitarian systems onto the text and instead let **Bible language** lead.

## 1. Biblical Foundation: One God, Yet Plurality in God

### 1.1 The Oneness of God

The Bible is emphatic: there is **one God**.

- Deuteronomy 6:4 – _“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD.”_
- Isaiah 45:5 – _“I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me.”_
- 1 Corinthians 8:4, 6 – _“…there is none other God but one… But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things… and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things…”_

So:

- God is **one** – not many competing gods.
- This “oneness” must be held firmly as we explore further.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for “one” in Deuteronomy 6:4 is **’echad**, which can mean a **compound unity**, as in “one flesh” (Genesis 2:24 – husband and wife), or “one cluster of grapes” (Numbers 13:23). It can mean a simple one, or a united one – context decides.

### 1.2 Hints of Plurality in the Old Testament

There are passages where God speaks in **plural** terms:

- Genesis 1:26 – _“Let **us** make man in **our** image…”_
- Genesis 3:22 – _“The man is become as one of **us**…”_
- Genesis 11:7 – _“Let **us** go down, and there confound their language…”_
- Isaiah 6:8 – _“Whom shall I send, and who will go for **us**?”_

These verses do not, by themselves, **define** the nature of the Godhead, but they suggest more than a simple, solitary person.

[Q] **“Could the ‘us’ just be God speaking to angels?”**
Angels do not create or share the divine image as creators. Yet Genesis 1:26–27 says *God* created man in *His* image, not in the image of angels, and no angel is ever placed as co‑creator with God. So while angels may be “present,” the creative “us” appears to be **within the Godhead** itself.

## 2. The Father: Source and Head

### 2.1 The Father as God

The Bible clearly identifies the Father as God:

- John 6:27 – _“…the Father, God…”_
- 1 Corinthians 8:6 – _“…one God, the Father, of whom are all things…”_
- Ephesians 4:6 – _“One God and Father of all, who is above all…”_

Key observations:

- The Father is often presented as the **source** (“of whom are all things” – 1 Corinthians 8:6).
- The Father sends the Son (John 3:16–17; 1 John 4:9–10).
- The Father is often described as the **head** in relational order (1 Corinthians 11:3).

### 2.2 Relation to the Son and Spirit

- The Father **loves** the Son (John 3:35; 5:20).
- The Father **gives** the Spirit (John 14:26; 15:26).

The Father appears as:

- **Origin** (in relational sense) – “of whom are all things” (1 Corinthians 8:6).
- **Sender** of Son and Spirit.
- **Supreme authority**, yet in unity with the Son and Spirit.

---

## 3. The Son (Jesus Christ): Divine, Yet Distinct

### 3.1 Is Jesus Really God?

The New Testament attributes deity to Christ:

- John 1:1–3 – _“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God… All things were made by Him.”_
- John 1:14 – _“The Word was made flesh…”_ (this is Jesus).
- Colossians 2:9 – _“In Him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.”_
- Hebrews 1:8 (quoting the Father about the Son) – _“But unto the Son He saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever…”_

Jesus receives worship that belongs only to God:

- Matthew 14:33 – _“They that were in the ship came and worshipped Him…”_
- John 20:28 – Thomas: _“My Lord and my God.”_ Jesus does not rebuke him.
- Hebrews 1:6 – _“…let all the angels of God worship Him.”_

### 3.2 Jesus Distinct from the Father

- John 1:1 – _“The Word was **with** God, and the Word **was** God.”_
  Distinct (“with”), yet fully divine (“was God”).
- John 17:5 – _“And now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was.”_
- 1 John 2:1 – _“We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.”_
  Two persons: **advocate** and **the one advocated to**.

Jesus speaks of Himself and the Father as **two** witnesses:

- John 8:16–18 – _“…I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent Me… I am one that bear witness of Myself, and the Father that sent Me beareth witness of Me.”_

So:

- The Son is **God**.
- The Son is **distinct** from the Father.
- The Son is **eternal** and **Creator** (Colossians 1:16–17; Hebrews 1:2).

[DYK🔎] Many early Adventist pioneers initially struggled to accept Christ’s full eternal deity because they were reacting against unbiblical versions of the Trinity. Over time, as they studied Scripture more deeply, leading thinkers (and Ellen White’s writings) increasingly affirmed Christ’s full, eternal divinity and true sonship in a way firmly grounded in the Bible.

## 4. The Holy Spirit: Person, Power, or Both?

This is often the most disputed point between Trinitarian and anti‑Trinitarian believers.

### 4.1 The Holy Spirit as Divine

The Holy Spirit bears divine attributes:

- **Omniscient**: 1 Corinthians 2:10–11 – _“…the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.”_
- **Omnipresent**: Psalm 139:7 – _“Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?”_
- **Life‑giver**: Job 33:4 – _“The Spirit of God hath made me…”_; John 6:63.

Lying to the Holy Spirit = lying to God:

- Acts 5:3–4 – _“Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost… thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.”_

The Spirit is placed in parallel with the Father and the Son:

- Matthew 28:19 – _“…baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”_
  One “name”, three titles.

### 4.2 Is the Holy Spirit a Person?

Look at the **personal language** of Jesus about the Spirit:

- John 14:16–17 – _“And I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter, that **He** may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth…”_
- John 14:26 – _“But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, **He** shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance…”_
- John 15:26 – _“…the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, **He** shall testify of Me.”_
- John 16:13–14 – _“Howbeit when **He**, the Spirit of truth, is come, **He** will guide you into all truth… **He** shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak… **He** shall glorify Me…”_

Personal actions of the Spirit:

- **Teaches** (John 14:26)
- **Testifies** (John 15:26)
- **Guides** (John 16:13)
- **Speaks** (Acts 13:2 – _“The Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul…”_)
- **Intercedes** (Romans 8:26–27)
- **Can be grieved** (Ephesians 4:30)

[Q] **“But in Greek, ‘spirit’ (pneuma) is neuter—doesn’t that mean it’s not a person?”**
Grammar alone doesn’t settle theology. Jesus deliberately uses **masculine pronouns** (He, Him) in John 14–16 when speaking of the Spirit. Also, “church” (ekklesia) is feminine in Greek, yet is clearly a body of people. Gender of nouns is grammatical, not ontological.

[Q] **“Could the Spirit just be the ‘presence’ or ‘power’ of God, not a distinct person?”**
The Spirit certainly is God’s presence and power (Luke 1:35; Acts 1:8). But Scripture adds **personal characteristics** and **intentional actions** beyond an impersonal force. An “it” does not speak, teach, guide, intercede, or choose missionaries (Acts 13:2).

### 4.3 Respecting the Spirit’s Chosen Hiddenness

Jesus adds an important limitation to our understanding of the Spirit:

- John 16:13–14 – _“He shall not speak of Himself; but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak… He shall glorify Me…”_

The Spirit does not draw attention to **Himself**, but to **Christ**. This means:

- The Spirit’s role is largely **self‑effacing** – He exalts Jesus, not His own person.
- Scripture gives fewer direct descriptions of the Spirit’s inner being than of the Father or the Son.
- We must accept that there are aspects of the Spirit’s person and operation we are **not meant to fully understand** now. They belong among the “secret things” (Deuteronomy 29:29), and we should be cautious about speculative curiosity.

From a centrist reading, the **simplest** way to honor all the data is:
- The Holy Spirit is **divine** and manifests God’s presence and power.
- The Holy Spirit acts with **personal will** and intelligence.
- The Holy Spirit is therefore best understood as a **divine person**, distinct from Father and Son, yet one in purpose and nature, while remaining largely hidden in self‑revelation.

## 5. How Do the Three Relate? What Does Scripture Actually Say?

Without forcing philosophical definitions, we look at the Bible’s own patterns.

### 5.1 Triadic Patterns in Scripture

Repeatedly, Father, Son, and Spirit appear together in a coordinated way:

- Matthew 3:16–17 – At Jesus’ baptism:
  - The **Son** is baptized.
  - The **Spirit** descends like a dove.
  - The **Father’s voice** speaks from heaven.
- Matthew 28:19 – One “name”, three designations: Father, Son, Holy Ghost.
- 2 Corinthians 13:14 – _“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.”_
- Ephesians 4:4–6 – One Spirit (v.4), one Lord (Jesus, v.5), one God and Father (v.6).

These do not explain **how** the three are one, but they show:

- **Three** are consistently recognized.
- All three are associated with divine acts and blessing.

### 5.2 Distinctions in Role and Function

From Scripture:

**The Father**

- **Source**: “Of whom are all things” (1 Corinthians 8:6).
- **Planner**: Ephesians 1:3–5 – He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.
- **Authority**: John 14:28 – _“My Father is greater than I”_ (in role, not in nature).
- **Sender** of Son and Spirit (John 3:16; 14:26).

**The Son**

- **Agent of Creation**: Colossians 1:16 – _“By Him were all things created…”_
- **Revealer of the Father**: John 14:9 – _“He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.”_
- **Redeemer and Mediator**: 1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 7:25.
- **Judge**: John 5:22 – _“The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son.”_

**The Holy Spirit**

- **Convicter**: John 16:8 – _“He will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment.”_
- **Regenerator**: John 3:5–8; Titus 3:5.
- **Sanctifier**: 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2.
- **Teacher and Reminder**: John 14:26.
- **Indwelling presence** of God in the believer: 1 Corinthians 3:16; Romans 8:9–11.

[DYK🔎] Some SDA pioneers described the plan of salvation as:
- **The Father** – the great Source and Originator of all.
- **The Son** – the Mediator through whom all things are done.
- **The Spirit** – the Representative who brings the presence of Father and Son to the believer’s heart.

## 6. Trinitarian vs Anti‑Trinitarian: What Does the Bible Support?

From first principles, we ask: what are the minimal truths we must affirm to be faithful to Scripture, without forcing later philosophical systems into the text?

### 6.1 Non‑Negotiable Biblical Points

1. There is **one God** (Deuteronomy 6:4; Isaiah 45:5; 1 Corinthians 8:4–6).
2. The **Father is God** (many texts).
3. The **Son (Jesus) is God** and is eternal, creator (John 1:1–3; Colossians 1:16–17; Hebrews 1:8–10).
4. The **Holy Spirit is God** (Acts 5:3–4; 1 Corinthians 2:10–11) and acts personally.
5. The Father, Son, and Spirit are **distinct** in person and role (John 14–17; Matthew 3:16–17).
6. The three act in **sovereign unity** in creation and redemption.

Any model—Trinitarian or anti‑Trinitarian—that denies or diminishes any of these clear points is departing from biblical evidence.

### 6.2 Common Extremes

**Certain anti‑Trinitarian views** often:
- Reduce Christ to a created being (contradicting John 1:1–3; Hebrews 1).
- Make the Spirit an impersonal force only (contradicting John 14–16; Acts 13:2).

**Certain traditional Trinitarian explanations** sometimes:
- Use non‑biblical terminology (like “co‑eternal consubstantial persons” in metaphysical detail) that go beyond Scripture.
- Philosophize about inner “substance” in ways Scripture does not detail.

A centrist, Scripture‑first position could be summarized like this:

- We affirm **full deity** of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- We affirm **distinction of persons** and **unity of God**.
- We affirm **economy of roles** (different functions in salvation).
- We are cautious about going **beyond** what is written (1 Corinthians 4:6), especially in speculative metaphysics and in trying to map out the Holy Spirit’s inner nature, since He “does not speak of Himself.”

[Q] **“So are we supposed to use the word ‘Trinity’ or not?”**
The word is not in Scripture, just as “investigative judgment” or “millennium” aren’t. The key is not the label, but whether the concept we hold matches **biblical data**. A humble approach is: use terms only insofar as they help convey what Scripture clearly teaches, and avoid building doctrine on the word itself.

## 7. Practical Application: Why the Godhead Matters

This is not mere theory. Understanding the Godhead in a biblical way leads to:

### 7.1 Assurance of Salvation

- The **Father** wants to save us (John 3:16).
- The **Son** accomplished our salvation (Romans 5:8; John 19:30).
- The **Spirit** applies salvation to our hearts (Titus 3:5–6; Romans 8:1–4).

We see that all Heaven is involved in our rescue. There is no division in the Godhead about saving sinners.

### 7.2 Prayer and Worship

- We pray **to the Father**, **in the name of the Son**, **through the Holy Spirit** (Ephesians 2:18; John 16:23–24; Romans 8:26).
- We worship the **one God**, acknowledging Father, Son, and Spirit (Revelation 5 shows worship to the Father and the Lamb).

### 7.3 Sanctification

- The Father disciplines and loves us as children (Hebrews 12:6–10).
- The Son is our example and High Priest (Hebrews 4:14–16).
- The Spirit writes God’s law in our hearts (Hebrews 10:15–16; Ezekiel 36:26–27).

This truth calls us to:

1. **Trust** the Father’s heart.
2. **Follow** the Son’s example and accept His mediation.
3. **Yield** to the Holy Spirit’s voice, conviction, and leading, while reverently accepting that we will not fully understand His inner being in this life.

---

## 8. Summary & Centrist Conclusions

### Key Takeaways

1. **One God, Three Personally Distinct**
   - The Bible affirms **one God**, while revealing Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as distinct in person and united in nature and purpose.

2. **Father, Son, Spirit – All Fully Divine**
   - Father is God.
   - Son is God, eternal Creator, worthy of worship.
   - Spirit is God, with personal will, mind, and action, yet choosing not to “speak of Himself,” keeping aspects of His person veiled from us.

3. **Different Roles in Harmony**
   - Father – Source, Planner, Sender.
   - Son – Revealer, Redeemer, Mediator, Judge.
   - Spirit – Indweller, Convicter, Teacher, Sanctifier.

4. **Holy Spirit: More Than a Force**
   - The Spirit is best understood, from Scripture, as a **divine person** who can be grieved, who teaches, speaks, guides, and intercedes, while remaining largely self‑effacing and not fully revealed to human understanding.

5. **Humility Where God is Silent**
   - We accept that some aspects of the Godhead, and especially the inner mystery of the Spirit, remain “secret things” (Deuteronomy 29:29). We should avoid speculative theories that go beyond the biblical record.
