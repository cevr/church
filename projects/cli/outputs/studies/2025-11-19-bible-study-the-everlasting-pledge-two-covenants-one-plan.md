# Bible Study: The Everlasting Pledge—Two Covenants, One Plan

## 1. Biblical Foundation: The Nature of the Covenants

Many Bible students view the "Old Covenant" and "New Covenant" merely as time periods—the Old Testament being a time of law and works, and the New Testament being a time of grace and freedom. However, when we let Scripture interpret Scripture, a different picture emerges.

**Thesis:** God’s plan for saving man has never changed. The "New Covenant" (salvation by grace through faith in God's promise) is actually the *original* and *everlasting* covenant. The "Old Covenant" represents humanity's failed attempt to save itself through works and the flesh.

### Key Text
> *"And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."* — **Genesis 3:15**

Here, immediately after the fall of man, God establishes the covenant of grace. Notice who does the work: The Seed (Christ) will crush the serpent. Adam and Eve simply had to believe the promise.

[DYK🔎] **Did You Know?** Theologians call Genesis 3:15 the *Protoevangelium*, which is Latin for "First Gospel." Before a single lamb was sacrificed or a single law written on stone, the Gospel of the "New Covenant" was preached to Adam and Eve.

## 2. Historical Context: The Tale of Two Methods

Throughout history, these two covenants have run parallel. One is the covenant of "God does it" (Grace/New), and the other is the covenant of "Man does it" (Works/Old).

### Cain and Abel: The First Visible Distinction
*   **Abel (The New Covenant):** Brought a lamb (Gen 4:4). He recognized he was a sinner and needed a substitute. He relied on *God’s provision*.
*   **Cain (The Old Covenant):** Brought the "fruit of the ground" (Gen 4:3). This represents human effort, tilling the cursed ground, and offering God the work of his own hands.

[Q] **"But didn't the Old Covenant begin at Sinai with Moses?"**
While the *national* covenant with Israel was ratified at Sinai (Exodus 19/24), the *principle* of the Old Covenant (seeking righteousness by works) has existed since the Fall. Paul tells us in Galatians 3:8 that the Gospel was preached to Abraham long before Moses. Therefore, the method of salvation (Grace) predates the giving of the Law at Sinai.

## 3. Biblical Development: Flesh vs. Promise

The clearest biblical illustration of these two covenants is found in the history of Abraham, specifically regarding his two sons. The Apostle Paul explicitly uses this history as an allegory for the covenants in Galatians 4.

### Sarah and Hagar (Galatians 4:22-31)

1.  **The Promise (Sarah/Isaac):** God promised Abraham a son. It seemed impossible because Sarah was barren. This required total faith in God's supernatural power to bring life out of a dead womb.
    *   *This is the New Covenant:* We are dead in trespasses, and only God can birth righteousness in us.

2.  **The Flesh (Hagar/Ishmael):** Abraham and Sarah got tired of waiting. They decided to help God out by using Hagar (human devising).
    *   *This is the Old Covenant:* Trying to fulfill God's promises through human strength and worldly methods.

> *"But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise."* — **Galatians 4:23**

### Saul and David: The King We Want vs. The King God Provides

We see this pattern repeated later in Israel's monarchy.

*   **King Saul (The Old Covenant/Man's Choice):** The people demanded a king "like all the nations" (1 Samuel 8:5). Saul was tall, strong, and looked the part. He represents the arm of flesh and human desire. His reign ended in failure because it was based on human wisdom.
*   **King David (The New Covenant/God's Choice):** David was the least likely choice—a shepherd boy. But he was God's anointed. He represents Christ (the Son of David). He did not seize the throne; he waited for God to give it to him.

[DYK🔎] **Did You Know?** The name "Jerusalem" (City of Peace) was originally the stronghold of the Jebusites. David conquered it and made it the center of worship. Just as David (God's Anointed) established the true kingdom where Saul failed, Christ establishes true peace in the heart where our human efforts fail.

## 4. The Tragedy at Sinai

If God's plan was always grace, what happened at Mount Sinai?

When God brought Israel out of Egypt, He reminded them of His grace: *"I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself"* (Exodus 19:4).

However, notice the people's response to God's law:
> *"And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken **we will do**."* — **Exodus 19:8**

This was a pledge of the Old Covenant. They presumed that they, in their own strength, could obey God's perfect law. They did not ask for a new heart; they relied on their own resolve. Within 40 days, they broke that covenant by worshipping the Golden Calf.

**The lesson:** The Law is holy, just, and good (Romans 7:12), but when sinful man tries to keep it using his own power (the Old Covenant), it results in death and bondage.

## 5. The New Covenant Realized

The "New Covenant" is not the abolition of the Law, but the *location* of the Law changing.

> *"But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, **I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts**; and will be their God, and they shall be my people."* — **Jeremiah 31:33**

| Feature | Old Covenant (Man's Attempt) | New Covenant (God's Promise) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reliance** | "We will do" (Ex 19:8) | "I [God] will do" (Ezek 36:27) |
| **Location of Law** | Tables of Stone | Tables of the Heart |
| **Result** | Bondage / Condemnation | Freedom / Justification |
| **Mediator** | Moses (Imperfect) | Jesus (Perfect) |

[Q] **"Does the New Covenant do away with the Ten Commandments?"**
Absolutely not. If a king writes his laws in a book, they are binding. If he writes them in the hearts of his subjects so that they *love* to obey him, has he abolished the law? No, he has established it! The New Covenant provides the power (The Holy Spirit) to live the life the Law requires.

## Conclusion & Application

The Bible presents one consistent plan of salvation: God doing for man what man cannot do for himself.

1.  **Understanding:** The "Old Covenant" is the experience of trying to earn salvation or please God through your own power. It ends in frustration (Romans 7).
2.  **Response:** The "New Covenant" is the experience of resting in Christ's finished work and allowing Him to write His character upon your heart (Romans 8).
3.  **Growth:** We must cease "helping God" like Abraham with Hagar, or "choosing Saul" like Israel. We must submit to the operation of God.

**Practical Thought:** Are you living in the Old Covenant or the New? When you sin, do you promise God, "I'll do better next time" (Old Covenant), or do you pray, "Lord, I cannot do this; please live out Your life through me" (New Covenant)?

> *"Now the God of peace... through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight..."* — **Hebrews 13:20-21**
