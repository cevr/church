# Bible Study: The Whole Person, Sin, and the State of the Dead

## Introduction: A Clear Thesis

Thesis: Scripture teaches that humans are a unified, living being made by God
from dust and divine breath; sin corrupts the inner life (the “heart”) and
brings death; at death consciousness ceases as the breath returns to God and the
body to dust; the believer’s hope is not an immortal disembodied soul but the
resurrection to immortality at Christ’s return.

This study unfolds progressively: Creation and the holistic nature of man → The
Bible’s vocabulary of the inner person → The entrance and effect of sin on the
“heart” → What actually happens at death → The believer’s hope → Practical life
and a warning about spiritualism → Common questions and historical notes.

[DYK🔎] The Bible never uses the phrases “immortal soul” or “undying soul.”
Immortality is attributed to God alone (1 Timothy 6:16) and is gifted to the
redeemed at the resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:51-54).

## 1) Biblical Foundation: How God Made Us (Holistic Anthropology)

- Genesis 2:7: “The LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
  into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”
  - Dust (material) + Breath of life (God’s life-giving power) = living soul (a
    whole, conscious person).
  - The text says man became a soul; it does not say man received a soul as a
    detachable part.
- Job 33:4: “The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives
  me life.”
- Ecclesiastes 12:7: At death “the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the
  spirit [breath] returns to God who gave it.” The Giver reclaims the
  life-principle; conscious life ceases.
- Psalm 104:29; Job 34:14-15: When God takes away breath/spirit (ruach),
  creatures die and return to dust.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for “soul” (nephesh) most often means “life,” “person,”
or “creature.” Animals are called nephesh chayyah—“living souls/creatures”—just
like Adam (Genesis 1:20-21; 2:19). The Hebrew “spirit” (ruach) means “breath,”
“wind,” or “life-giving power,” not an inherently conscious ghost.

## 2) The Bible’s Vocabulary of the Inner Person

- Heart (Heb. lev; Gk. kardia)
  - The control center of thought, will, motives, and trust (Proverbs 4:23;
    Romans 10:10).
  - Also the seat of love and obedience (Deuteronomy 6:5; Psalm 51:10; Matthew
    12:34).
  - God’s promise: a new heart and Spirit (Ezekiel 36:26-27; Hebrews 8:10).

- Soul (Heb. nephesh; Gk. psyche)
  - Often means “life,” “self,” or “person” (e.g., Acts 27:37 “276 souls”—i.e.,
    people; Joshua 2:13).
  - Souls die (Ezekiel 18:4, 20). Hence “soul” in Scripture is not inherently
    immortal.

- Spirit (Heb. ruach; Gk. pneuma)
  - God’s life-breath/energizing power (Genesis 2:7; Job 27:3).
  - Returns to God at death (Ecclesiastes 12:7); not a conscious entity floating
    independently.

[DYK🔎] Hebrew thinking is holistic. “Heart,” “soul,” and “spirit” overlap and
describe the same person from different angles (mind, life, vitality)—not
separable, immortal parts.

## 3) The Entrance and Effects of Sin: What Went Wrong

- Genesis 3; Romans 5:12: Through sin, death entered the world and spread to
  all.
- Romans 6:23: “The wages of sin is death.”
- Ephesians 2:1-3: We are “dead in trespasses and sins,” enslaved to fleshly
  desires.
- Jeremiah 17:9: “The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
  wicked.”
- Mark 7:21-23: Evil actions proceed from within—from the heart.

The core problem of sin is not merely behavior but a corrupted inner person
(“heart”), the biblical control center of thought, choice, desire, and trust.

## 4) What Happens at Death?

- Cessation of conscious activity:
  - Ecclesiastes 9:5-6,10: “The dead know not any thing… their love, their
    hatred… is now perished… there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor
    wisdom, in the grave.”
  - Psalm 146:4: At death, one’s thoughts perish.
  - Psalm 115:17; 6:5: The dead do not praise God; no remembrance in the grave.
- Return to elements/life-principle:
  - Body returns to dust; breath/spirit returns to God (Ecclesiastes 12:7).
- Death as sleep:
  - John 11:11-14: Jesus calls death “sleep.”
  - Daniel 12:2: “Many… that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake.”
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:13-16: Those who “sleep in Jesus” will be raised at His
    coming.

[DYK🔎] Scripture repeatedly uses “sleep” for death. Kings “slept with their
fathers,” a Hebrew idiom that anticipates a future awakening by God (1 Kings and
2 Chronicles consistently).

## 5) The Christian Hope: Resurrection and Immortality in Christ

- John 5:28-29; 6:39-40: The dead are raised at the “last day.”
- 1 Corinthians 15:20-23, 51-54: At Christ’s return, mortality “puts on
  immortality.”
- 2 Timothy 1:10: Christ “brought life and immortality to light through the
  gospel.”
- Revelation 1:18: Jesus holds the keys of death and Hades (the grave).

Our hope is not an immortal soul surviving death, but the sure resurrection of
the whole person by the power of Christ.

[DYK🔎] Many early Protestant voices challenged the Greek idea of the soul’s
natural immortality. William Tyndale argued that the true Christian hope is the
resurrection, and Martin Luther at times spoke of death as an unconscious
“sleep” until the day of Christ.

## 6) Practical Christian Living: Heart Renewal, Holiness, and Hope

This truth calls us to:

1. Guard the heart: “Keep your heart with all diligence” (Proverbs 4:23). Seek
   the new heart promised in the new covenant (Ezekiel 36:26-27; Hebrews 8:10).
2. Present the body: Honor God in your body and spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20;
   Romans 12:1). We are whole persons; holiness involves lifestyle, health, and
   habits.
3. Live by the Spirit: Walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit (Romans
   8:5-14). Victory over sin begins with inner renewal.
4. Grieve with hope: Comfort one another with the promise of the resurrection (1
   Thessalonians 4:13-18).
5. Saturate the mind with Scripture: Renew the mind daily (Romans 12:2; Psalm
   119:11) so that God’s Word, not tradition or culture, shapes your view of
   life and death.

## 7) Spiritualism: Why It Is Dangerous

- Biblical prohibitions:
  - Deuteronomy 18:9-13 forbids consulting mediums, necromancers, or those with
    familiar spirits—these practices are “abomination to the LORD.”
  - Isaiah 8:19-20 warns against seeking the dead and calls us back to “the law
    and the testimony.”
- Nature of the deception:
  - Since the dead “know not any thing” (Ecclesiastes 9:5), apparitions or
    messages from “the dead” are not from departed loved ones but deceiving
    spirits (2 Corinthians 11:14-15; 1 Timothy 4:1).
  - End-time warning: “Spirits of devils, working miracles” gather the world to
    the final conflict (Revelation 16:13-14; Matthew 24:24; 2 Thessalonians
    2:9-10).
- Case study:
  - Saul at Endor (1 Samuel 28): God had refused to answer Saul; consulting a
    medium directly violated God’s word. The “Samuel” apparition contradicts the
    Bible’s teaching on death and God’s methods, revealing demonic
    impersonation.
- Present truth application:
  - Modern spiritualism appears through channeling, “angel” messages, near-death
    claims, and even religious miracles that deny Scripture. The safeguard is
    clear: test all by the Word (Isaiah 8:20; Revelation 13:13-14).

[DYK🔎] Isaiah says mediums “chirp and mutter” (Isaiah 8:19). The Hebrew term
for “familiar spirit” (’ob) is linked with hollow sounds—reminding us that
spiritualist phenomena are counterfeit voices, not the living God.

## 8) Common Questions

[Q] “What about the thief on the cross—didn’t Jesus say, ‘Today you will be with
Me in paradise’?” (Luke 23:43)

- Greek manuscripts were written without commas. The phrase may be punctuated,
  “Truly I say to you today, you will be with Me in Paradise,” emphasizing the
  promise given that day. Jesus Himself did not go to Paradise that Friday (see
  John 20:17 on Sunday: “I have not yet ascended”). The thief’s hope (like ours)
  is secure in Christ, realized at the resurrection.

[DYK🔎] Ancient Greek lacked modern punctuation. Commas were added centuries
later by editors and translators.

[Q] “The rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16) looks like conscious life after death.”

- It functions as a parable using familiar imagery to rebuke the Pharisees’ love
  of money (Luke 16:14-15) and to warn that Scripture is sufficient for
  repentance (Luke 16:29-31). Taking every detail literally would clash with
  plain texts about the dead knowing nothing (Ecclesiastes 9:5-6) and being
  unable to cross great gulfs after death. Like other parables, it uses story
  elements to make a moral/theological point.

[Q] “Does 2 Corinthians 5:6-8 teach immediate presence with the Lord after
death?”

- Paul contrasts our mortal “tent” with being “clothed” with immortality (2
  Corinthians 5:1-4). He desires not nakedness (disembodied existence) but to be
  clothed with the immortal body—fulfilled at the resurrection (1 Corinthians
  15:51-54). From the believer’s perspective, death’s sleep is unconscious; the
  next conscious moment is Christ’s presence at His coming.

[Q] “What about ‘souls under the altar’ in Revelation 6:9-11?”

- Revelation is symbolic. Like Abel’s blood “crying” from the ground (Genesis
  4:10), the martyrs’ “souls” cry for justice. White robes (vindication) are
  given; they “rest” until the full number of martyrs is complete—pointing to
  delayed vindication, not conscious life in heaven before resurrection.

[Q] “Didn’t Saul speak with Samuel’s spirit at Endor?” (1 Samuel 28)

- God had already refused to answer Saul by prophets or dreams (1 Samuel 28:6).
  Scripture forbids consulting the dead (Deuteronomy 18:10-12). The apparition
  contradicts God’s means and the Bible’s teaching on death, revealing a
  deceptive manifestation. The state of the dead elsewhere rules out genuine
  contact with departed saints.

[Q] “Moses and Elijah at the Transfiguration—doesn’t that prove disembodied
souls?” (Matthew 17:1-9)

- Elijah was translated without seeing death (2 Kings 2:11). Jude 9 points to a
  special resurrection of Moses, and Jesus Himself calls the event a “vision”
  (Matthew 17:9). The scene anticipates the kingdom and the resurrection glory,
  not disembodied existence.

[Q] “What about ‘spirit, soul, and body’ in 1 Thessalonians 5:23?”

- Paul is praying for holistic sanctification. The terms overlap to emphasize
  total consecration, not to define three separable, immortal components.
  Elsewhere “soul” simply means “life/person” and “spirit” the life-breath or
  inner disposition.

## 9) Historical and Present-Truth Notes

- Background: Greek philosophy (Plato) popularized the idea of the soul’s
  inherent immortality, influencing later Christian tradition.
- Significance: Scripture’s Hebraic frame is holistic and resurrection-centered.
  The gospel’s promise is life from the dead through Christ.
- Present Truth: In a world fascinated with near-death tales, paranormal media,
  and “messages from beyond,” Scripture anchors us: the dead sleep; Christ
  returns; the resurrection restores the whole person; deceptions must be
  resisted by the plain Word (Isaiah 8:20). Adventist pioneers and Ellen G.
  White repeatedly warned that spiritualism will play a major role in end-time
  deception and that our safety is in “It is written” (cf. The Great
  Controversy).

## Conclusion

God formed us as unified beings—breath and body—made for life with Him. Sin
corrupted our hearts and brought death, but Christ conquered death and
guarantees resurrection life. Until He comes, the dead rest unconsciously. Our
call now is heart-deep repentance, Spirit-empowered holiness, vigilant
resistance to spiritualistic deception, and steadfast hope in the resurrection.

### Key Takeaways:

1. Truth: Humans are living souls—whole persons—not owners of immortal,
   separable souls (Genesis 2:7; Ezekiel 18:4).
2. Application: Seek a new heart, guard your inner life, and live wholly for God
   (Proverbs 4:23; Ezekiel 36:26-27; Romans 12:1-2).
3. Growth: Fix your hope on Christ’s return and the resurrection; comfort others
   with this hope; reject spiritualism by testing all things by Scripture (1
   Thessalonians 4:13-18; Isaiah 8:20; Deuteronomy 18:9-13).

“Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
changed… and this mortal must put on immortality.” (1 Corinthians 15:51-54)

==================== Review Checklist (for your study and sharing)

- Creation equation: Dust + breath = living soul (Genesis 2:7; Psalm 104:29-30;
  Job 33:4).
- Sin’s effect: Death enters; the heart is corrupted (Romans 5:12; Jeremiah
  17:9; Mark 7:21-23; Ephesians 2:1-3).
- Terms clarified:
  - Heart = inner control center (Proverbs 4:23; Ezekiel 36:26).
  - Soul = life/person; not inherently immortal (Ezekiel 18:4, 20; Acts 27:37).
  - Spirit = life-breath from God; not a conscious ghost (Ecclesiastes 12:7; Job
    34:14-15).
- Death’s state: Unconscious sleep; no praise or knowledge (Ecclesiastes
  9:5-6,10; Psalm 146:4; John 11:11-14).
- Hope: Resurrection at Christ’s return; immortality then bestowed (John
  5:28-29; 1 Corinthians 15:51-54; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17).
- Spiritualism: Forbidden by God; empowered by deceiving spirits; special
  end-time danger (Deuteronomy 18:9-13; Isaiah 8:19-20; Revelation 16:13-14;
  Matthew 24:24).
- Objections addressed: Luke 23:43; Luke 16; 2 Corinthians 5:6-8; Revelation
  6:9-11; 1 Samuel 28; Matthew 17:1-9; 1 Thessalonians 5:23.
- Practical response: Guard the heart; pursue holiness; comfort the grieving;
  avoid and expose spiritualism by the Word.
