# Bible Study: The Harvest of the Spirit—The Former and Latter Rain

## Introduction: God’s Agricultural Metaphor

Throughout Scripture, God often uses the natural world to explain spiritual realities. To understand the work of the Holy Spirit in the plan of salvation, we must look to the harvest cycle of ancient Israel. The prophets Joel, Hosea, and Zechariah used the terms "former rain" and "latter rain" to describe the outpouring of God’s Spirit.

Understanding this distinction is not merely academic; it is a vital "Present Truth" for those living in the final days of earth's history. It answers the question: *How will the gospel work be finished, and how will God's people be prepared to stand when Jesus returns?*

**Key Text:**
> _"Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month."_ — **Joel 2:23**

## Section 1: The Agricultural Context

To interpret the Bible correctly, we must first understand what these terms meant to the people who heard them. In Palestine, there were two critical rainy seasons essential for the harvest.

1.  **The Former (Early) Rain:** This fell in the autumn (October/November) at seed-sowing time. Its purpose was to germinate the seed and help it take root. Without this, there would be no life.
2.  **The Latter Rain:** This fell in the spring (March/April) just before the harvest. Its purpose was to ripen the grain, preparing it for the sickle.

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for "former rain" is *moreh*, which can also be translated as "teacher" or "teaching." This suggests a beautiful connection: just as the rain prepares the soil, the teaching of the Word prepares the heart for the Holy Spirit.

### Spiritual Application
- **The Former Rain** represents the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the beginning of the Christian dispensation (Pentecost) and, individually, at the beginning of our Christian walk (Conversion).
- **The Latter Rain** represents the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit to finish God’s work on earth and to ripen the character of the believer for heaven.

## Section 2: The Individual Experience (Personal Application)

Before we apply these prophecies to the church as a whole, we must apply them to the individual heart. The work of grace is progressive; we cannot reach the harvest without first passing through the seasons of growth.

> _"For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear."_ — **Mark 4:28**

### The Personal Former Rain
This is the work of the Holy Spirit at conversion and during the early stages of sanctification. Just as the autumn rain caused the seed to germinate, the Spirit breaks up the "fallow ground" of our hearts (Hosea 10:12). It brings:
*   Conviction of sin.
*   The new birth.
*   Daily growth in the knowledge of Christ.

If we neglect this daily "moisture"—prayer, study, and obedience—the spiritual plant withers.

### The Personal Latter Rain
This is the spiritual maturity required for the final harvest. As the believer grows in grace, the image of Christ is reproduced in the character. The personal latter rain is the "settling" into the truth so that the believer cannot be moved. It is the preparation to receive the seal of God.

[Q] **"Can I skip the daily growth and just wait for the final outpouring?"**

**Response:** No. In the natural world, if the early rain does not do its work, the latter rain brings no benefit to the seed; there is nothing to ripen. Spiritually, if we do not make use of the Spirit's power today to overcome pride, selfishness, and sin, the "Latter Rain" will not transform us. It will fall upon us as water on a rock, slipping away while we remain unchanged. The Latter Rain *ripens* the fruit; it does not *create* it.

## Section 3: The Historical Fulfillment (The Corporate Early Rain)

The prophecy of the "former rain" saw its primary historical fulfillment for the church on the Day of Pentecost.

> _"But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me..."_ — **Acts 1:8**

When the disciples emptied themselves of pride and sought God in unity, the Spirit was poured out. The result?
*   The gospel seed germinated rapidly.
*   3,000 were converted in a day (Acts 2:41).
*   The Christian church was established.

However, the church, like the individual, cannot survive on the experience of the past. The momentum of Pentecost launched the church, but a final power is needed to complete the commission.

## Section 4: The Prophetic Promise (The Corporate Latter Rain)

Just as the early rain caused the seed to spring up, the latter rain is given to bring the harvest to maturity. We believe, based on prophetic chronology, that we are living in the time when we should be asking for this final outpouring.

> _"Ask ye of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain; so the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field."_ — **Zechariah 10:1**

### The Purpose of the Latter Rain:
1.  **To Finish the Work:** Just as Pentecost began the work, the Latter Rain will finish it. It empowers the "Loud Cry" of the angel in Revelation 18:1, enlightening the whole earth with God's glory.
2.  **To Ripen Character:** It seals the saints, settling them into the truth so intellectually and spiritually that they cannot be shaken by the coming delusions.
3.  **To Strengthen for the Crisis:** It provides the spiritual stamina to stand through the "time of trouble" (Daniel 12:1) without a Mediator after probation closes.

> _"Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain."_ — **James 5:7**

## Section 5: Prerequisites for Receiving the Rain

This is the most practical and urgent part of the study. God does not pour clean water into unclean vessels. We cannot expect the Latter Rain to fix character flaws we have neglected to address.

### 1. The Vessel Must Be Clean (Repentance)
> _"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord."_ — **Acts 3:19**

Note the order: Repentance and conversion come *before* the refreshing (Latter Rain). We must be gaining victory over every besetting sin now.

### 2. Total Unity and Removal of Dissension
At Pentecost, they were "all with one accord" (Acts 2:1). Division, gossip, and strife drive the Spirit away. The Latter Rain requires a people united in truth and love.

### 3. Active Labor for Souls
The rain is given to produce a harvest, not just to make the stalks feel good. The Spirit is given to those who are working for the salvation of others.

[DYK🔎] In the Sanctuary service, the High Priest could not enter the Most Holy Place until he was cleansed. Today, as Christ ministers in the heavenly Sanctuary, we must afflict our souls and cleanse our hearts of all defilement to receive His seal.

[Q] **"Will the Latter Rain make me holy so I don't have to struggle with sin anymore?"**

**Response:** This is a dangerous misconception. The Latter Rain does not *make* you holy; it *seals* you in the holiness you have already attained through the grace of Christ. The ripening sun/rain does not change a thornbush into wheat; it only ripens what is already there. If we are not Christ-like *now* (under the former rain), the Latter Rain will only find us as tares, not wheat.

## Section 6: The Present Truth Application

Why has the harvest been delayed? Why is the church still here? It is not because God is unwilling to give the rain, but because the grain is not yet ripe.

The prophet John saw the harvest of the earth:
> _"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap... for the harvest of the earth is ripe."_ — **Revelation 14:15**

The Greek word for "ripe" here effectively means "dried" or fully withered of self. When the character of Christ is perfectly reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His own.

### Signs We Are Near:
- The "shaking" of the nations.
- The fulfillment of the prophecies of Daniel and Revelation.
- The pressing need for a power that exceeds human logic to finish the gospel commission.

## Conclusion

The promise of the Latter Rain is the hope of the church. It is the power that will trigger the final events of history. But we must not sit idly by, waiting for a sensational emotional experience in the future.

### Key Takeaways:
1.  **Preparation:** We must cherish the "Early Rain" daily—studying the Word, praying, and overcoming sin in our personal walk.
2.  **Purpose:** The Spirit is given for service, to ripen the harvest for Jesus' return.
3.  **Urgency:** Now is the time to empty our hearts of self so there is room for the Holy Spirit to fill us completely.

**Final Thought:**
> _"For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring."_ — **Isaiah 44:3**

Are you thirsty? Only the thirsty will be filled. Let us plead for the showers of grace today.
