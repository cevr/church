# Bible Study: The Gifts of the Holy Spirit

_(What they are, what they are not, and how they relate to the gift of tongues)_

---

## 1. Biblical Foundation: What Are the Gifts of the Holy Spirit?

**Thesis**: The gifts of the Holy Spirit are God-given abilities entrusted to
believers for the building up of Christ’s body (the church), not for
self-exaltation or as a badge of spiritual superiority. They are diverse,
distributed as the Spirit wills, and no single gift is given to all.

### Key Passages

1. **Romans 12:4–8** – Practical service gifts
   - Prophecy
   - Ministry (service)
   - Teaching
   - Exhortation (encouragement)
   - Giving
   - Ruling/leading
   - Showing mercy

2. **1 Corinthians 12:4–11, 27–31** – Miraculous and spiritual insight gifts
   - Word of wisdom
   - Word of knowledge
   - Faith (special trust in God for great things)
   - Gifts of healing
   - Working of miracles
   - Prophecy
   - Discerning of spirits
   - Divers kinds of tongues
   - Interpretation of tongues

3. **Ephesians 4:11–13** – Leadership/office gifts
   - Apostles
   - Prophets
   - Evangelists
   - Pastors
   - Teachers

_All these are bestowed by the same Spirit for one purpose:_

> “But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man **to profit
> withal**.”
> — 1 Corinthians 12:7

**Core idea**: Gifts are for **edification**, not entertainment; for
**service**, not status.

[DYK🔎] The Bible lists are not identical in each passage. That’s a strong hint
that the point is not “memorize one fixed list” but “understand that the Spirit
supplies whatever gifts are needed for the mission and health of the church at
any time.”

## 2. Are the Gifts Themselves a Sign We Have the Holy Spirit?

Let’s start simple and then deepen.

### Level 1: Simple

- Gifts are **evidence** that the Spirit is working in the church.
- But possessing a gift is **not proof of personal conversion**.

Jesus warned plainly:

> “Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not **prophesied in thy
> name?** and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
> wonderful works?
> And then will I profess unto them, **I never knew you**: depart from me, ye
> that work iniquity.”
> — Matthew 7:22–23

They had gifts (or at least powerful religious experiences), but **no
relationship**.

### Level 2: Distinguishing Gifts and Fruit

The **true sign** that we are under the control of the Holy Spirit is the
**fruit of the Spirit**, not primarily the gifts:

> “But the fruit of the Spirit is **love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness,
> goodness, faith, meekness, temperance**…”
> — Galatians 5:22–23

- **Gifts = what we can do in ministry.**
- **Fruit = what we are in character.**

It is possible to:

- Have gifts without fruit (Matthew 7:22–23).
- But **impossible** to have the fruit without the Spirit (Romans 8:9).

So:

- **Signs of truly having the Holy Spirit** = repentance (Acts 2:37–38),
  obedience to God’s word (Acts 5:32), Christlike character (Galatians 5:22–23),
  love for truth (2 Thessalonians 2:10).
- **Gifts** are tools God gives to such people, as He sees best.

[Q] **“So are gifts irrelevant to knowing if the Spirit is present?”**
Not irrelevant—but secondary. Gifts show the Spirit is active to bless **the
church’s mission**. Fruit shows the Spirit is ruling **the heart**. We must not
reverse the order.

## 3. Do We Need All the Gifts? Does Every Believer Have the Same Gifts?

### Clear Biblical Answer

Paul settles this very directly with a series of rhetorical questions:

> “Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of
> miracles?
> Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?”
> — 1 Corinthians 12:29–30

The implied answer in Greek and in context is: **No** to every question.

Paul’s main analogy:

> “For as the body is one, and hath many members…so also is Christ.”
> — 1 Corinthians 12:12
> “If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were
> hearing, where were the smelling?”
> — 1 Corinthians 12:17

**Key points:**

- The church is **one body** with **many members** (1 Corinthians 12:12).
- God **“hath set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased
  him.”** (1 Corinthians 12:18).
- Not everyone receives the same gift; if they did, the body would be deformed.

So:

- We do **not** need all gifts individually.
- The **church corporately** needs the **full variety** of gifts.
- You only need to be faithful with **the gift(s) you personally receive**
  (Matthew 25:14–30).

[DYK🔎] In the parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14–30), all three servants had
_different_ amounts, but only one was condemned—the one who **did nothing** with
what he had. The problem is not having “only one gift”, but failing to use it.

## 4. The Gift of Tongues: What It Is (Biblically) and What It Is Not

Now we narrow in on tongues, using the same “progressive” pattern—from clear
basics to more detail.

### 4.1. First Occurrence: Acts 2 and the Reversal of Babel

**Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1–9)**

- Humanity united in **rebellion** against God.
- God **confused their language** so they could not understand each other
  (Genesis 11:7).
- Result: **scattering** and division; communication breakdown.

**Pentecost (Acts 2:1–12)**

- The disciples “were all with one accord in one place” (Acts 2:1) – united in
  **obedience** and prayer.
- The Spirit descended, and:

> “They were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to **speak with other
> tongues**, as the Spirit gave them utterance.”
> — Acts 2:4

Crucial detail:

> “Every man heard them speak in **his own language**.”
> — Acts 2:6
> “How hear we every man in **our own tongue, wherein we were born?**”
> — Acts 2:8

So at Pentecost:

- The **curse of confusion** at Babel was **partially reversed**.
- Where Babel brought **confusion and scattering**, tongues at Pentecost brought
  **understanding and gathering** into the gospel.
- The gift of tongues was not random noise but **understandable human
  languages** miraculously spoken by those who had not learned them.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word for “tongue” (glōssa) is used both for the organ and for
**a language**—just like in English we speak of “mother tongue.” In Acts 2 it
clearly means **real languages**.

### 4.2. What the Gift of Tongues Is (Biblical Definition)

Combine Acts 2 and 1 Corinthians 12–14:

- A **supernatural ability** given by the Holy Spirit
- To speak in a **real language** that the speaker has not learned naturally
- For the purpose of communicating the **gospel and truth**
- For the **edification** of those listening.

Paul’s summary principle:

> “Except ye utter by the tongue **words easy to be understood**, how shall it
> be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.”
> — 1 Corinthians 14:9

### 4.3. What the Gift of Tongues Is Not

From Scripture:

1. **Not nonsensical babbling**
   - Paul insists repeatedly on **understanding**:
     - “I had rather speak **five words with my understanding**…than ten
       thousand words in an unknown tongue.” (1 Corinthians 14:19)
     - “If I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that
       speaketh a barbarian…” (1 Corinthians 14:11)
   - The Spirit does not produce **meaningless sound**; He is the “Spirit of
     truth” (John 16:13).

2. **Not a sign of superior spirituality**
   - 1 Corinthians 1:7 shows the Corinthian church “came behind in no gift,” yet
     1 Corinthians is one long correction of their problems (divisions,
     immorality, lawsuits, disorder, pride).
   - Gifts do not equal maturity. Corinth had **many gifts** but very mixed
     character.

3. **Not a universal sign of having the Holy Spirit**
   - Paul asks: “Do all speak with tongues?” (1 Corinthians 12:30) – answer:
     **No**.
   - The greatest is **love**, not tongues (1 Corinthians 13:1–3, 8).
   - The Spirit may or may not give a particular gift depending on the needs of
     the work, not as a universal badge.

4. **Not meant to bypass the mind**
   - “I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray **with the understanding
     also**: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing **with the
     understanding also**.” (1 Corinthians 14:15)
   - Genuine spiritual experience does not ask us to **turn off** the mind.

[Q] **“But what about ‘unknown tongue’ in 1 Corinthians 14?”**
The word “unknown” is in italics in the KJV, meaning it was **added by
translators** to make the English flow. Paul is simply talking about a **foreign
language** not understood by the local congregation. That’s why he insists on
**interpretation** (1 Corinthians 14:27–28).

## 5. The Purpose and Regulation of Tongues in the Church

### Purpose

- **Sign for unbelievers** (especially those who speak another language):
  > “Wherefore tongues are for a sign, **not to them that believe, but to them
  > that believe not**…”
  > — 1 Corinthians 14:22
- **Practical missionary aid** to reach people of other tongues more quickly,
  especially where language barriers would hinder the spread of the gospel.

### Paul’s Rules (1 Corinthians 14)

These show how careful, orderly, and practical the true gift is:

1. In public worship, if anyone speaks in a foreign tongue:
   - Let it be **by two, or at the most by three**, each in turn. (v. 27)
   - There must be an **interpreter**. (v. 27)
   - If none interpret, **keep silence in the church**. (v. 28)

2. Edification is the test:
   - “Let all things be done unto **edifying**.” (v. 26)

3. Prophecy is usually **more useful in the local church** than tongues:
   - “He that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and
     comfort.” (v. 3)
   - “Greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues,
     **except he interpret**.” (v. 5)

[DYK🔎] If modern practice followed Paul’s simple rules—no more than 2–3, in
turn, always interpreted, and evaluated for edification—most so‑called “tongues”
meetings today would look very different, and much of the confusion would
vanish.

## 6. Progressive View of Tongues: From Babel to Final Mission

Let’s step back and see the **big storyline**:

1. **Babel (Genesis 11)**
   - Human pride → one rebellious project → God introduces **many languages** →
     confusion and scattering.

2. **Israel’s mission**
   - Israel was to be a light to the nations (Isaiah 42:6; 49:6), but often
     failed. Language barriers remained a reality.

3. **Pentecost (Acts 2)**
   - With Christ’s sacrifice complete and His priestly ministry begun in heaven,
     the Spirit is poured out.
   - Gift of tongues lets the apostles instantly reach a **multi-national
     audience** gathered in Jerusalem.

4. **Ongoing mission (Acts and onward)**
   - The early church continues to cross linguistic and cultural barriers (Acts
     8–10, 13 and forward).
   - The gift of tongues is one tool among many to advance the gospel quickly.

5. **Final proclamation (Revelation 14:6–7)**
   - The everlasting gospel goes to **“every nation, and kindred, and tongue,
     and people.”**
   - The Spirit may again specially empower language bridging, but the primary
     sign of God’s end-time people is **keeping the commandments of God and the
     faith of Jesus** (Revelation 14:12), not possession of a specific gift.

So tongues is one way God **pushes back the curse of Babel**, restoring
understanding for the sake of salvation. But the final measure of God’s people
is obedience and faith, not language gifts.

## 7. Practical Application: How Should We Relate to the Gifts Today?

### 7.1. Attitude Toward All Gifts

This truth calls us to:

1. **Desire gifts in love, not envy**
   - “Covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent
     way.” (1 Corinthians 12:31)
   - That “more excellent way” is the way of **love** (1 Corinthians 13).

2. **Value all parts of the body**
   - Even “less visible” gifts (helps, mercy, administration, quiet
     faithfulness) are precious to God (1 Corinthians 12:22–25).

3. **Test all manifestations by Scripture**
   - “To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word,
     it is because there is no light in them.” (Isaiah 8:20)
   - Emotional impact or apparent power is not enough; it must harmonize with
     God’s word and character.

### 7.2. Attitude Toward Tongues Specifically

- Be grateful if God gives a real language ability for mission.
- Refuse to accept anything that:
  - Bypasses the **mind**.
  - Cannot be **understood** or **interpreted**.
  - Is used as a **test of salvation** or spiritual rank.
- Keep Christ central; the Spirit’s role is to **glorify Christ** (John 16:14),
  not to draw attention to spectacular displays for their own sake.

[Q] **“If I don’t have tongues, am I missing something essential?”**
No. The essential evidence of the Spirit is:

- New birth (John 3:3–5)
- Victory over sin (Romans 8:13–14)
- Love, joy, peace, and the rest of the fruit (Galatians 5:22–23)
- Obedient faith in Christ and His commandments (John 14:15–17; Acts 5:32)

If you have these, you have what is most essential. Any gift, including tongues,
is secondary and subject to God’s wise choice.

## 8. Summary and Key Takeaways

1. **What are the gifts of the Spirit?**
   - God-given abilities (varied and complementary) to build up the church and
     advance the gospel (Romans 12; 1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4).

2. **Are gifts a sign we have the Holy Spirit?**
   - They are a sign that the Spirit is **working**, but not a guarantee of
     personal conversion.
   - The **fruit** of the Spirit and an obedient, Christlike life are the
     clearest signs of truly having the Spirit.

3. **Do we need all the gifts?**
   - No individual has all gifts. The **body** needs the diversity; each member
     needs to faithfully use what God has given.

4. **Gift of tongues – what it is and what it isn’t**
   - **Is**: A miraculous ability to speak real, human languages not previously
     learned, for the purpose of proclaiming God’s truth and overcoming language
     barriers. A partial **reversal of Babel’s confusion**.
   - **Is not**: Nonsensical babbling; a bypassing of the mind; a universal sign
     of the Holy Spirit; or a measure of spiritual superiority.

5. **How should we respond?**
   - Seek the Giver more than the gifts.
   - Welcome and encourage all biblically sound gifts in the church.
   - Measure all by Scripture, by edification, and by the character of Christ.

_Final encouragement:_

> “Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may
> prophesy.”
> — 1 Corinthians 14:1
