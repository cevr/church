# Bible Study: The Word Made Flesh—Christ Our Brother and Our Pattern

## Introduction: The Mystery of Godliness

The central pillar of the Christian faith is the Incarnation—God becoming man. But to truly understand the magnitude of Christ's sacrifice and the hope of our salvation, we must ask: *What kind of man did He become?* Did He take the unfallen nature of Adam in Eden, or did He descend to take the nature of Abraham and David—flesh bearing the results of four thousand years of sin, yet remaining without sin?

This study explores the beautiful truth that Jesus took our actual human nature to fight our battle, establishing a pathway for us to overcome as He overcame.

### Key Biblical Foundation

- **John 1:14**: *"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us..."*
- **Romans 8:3**: *"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the **likeness of sinful flesh**, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh."*
- **Hebrews 2:14**: *"Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself **likewise took part of the same**..."*

[DYK🔎] The Greek word used for "likeness" in Romans 8:3 is *homoiōma*. It doesn't mean "fake" or "phantom." It implies a real resemblance. Just as Philippians 2:7 says He was made in the "likeness" of men (meaning He really was a man), Romans 8:3 implies He really took the flesh that needs redeeming.

## Section 1: Identifying with the Fallen Race

To be the Savior of mankind, Christ had to reach man where he was. A ladder that stops halfway down a precipice cannot save the man at the bottom. The Bible teaches that Jesus bypassed the nature of angels and even the unfallen nature of Adam to reach us in our degradation.

### The Seed of Abraham
The book of Hebrews is precise about Christ's lineage and nature:

> *"For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren..."* (Hebrews 2:16-17)

If Jesus had come in the nature of unfallen Adam, He would not have been "like unto his brethren," for we are not like unfallen Adam. We possess hereditary weaknesses and frailty. To save us, He entered into the great family of humanity.

[Q] **"If Jesus took 'sinful flesh,' doesn't that make Him a sinner?"**
This is a crucial distinction! **Sin is a choice, not just a physical condition.** Having "sinful flesh" means possessing a physical nature with the *capacity* and *tendency* to be tempted, but Jesus never yielded to those tendencies. He was "without sin" (Hebrews 4:15). He carried the infirmities of the flesh (hunger, weariness, the capacity for pain) but never allowed the flesh to dictate His actions. He remained the spotless Lamb of God in a marred vessel.

## Section 2: Tempted in All Points

The reality of Christ's victory depends on the reality of His temptation. If Jesus did not possess a nature capable of being tempted by human struggles, then His victory is merely a divine pageant, not a moral conquest.

### The Internal Struggle
James 1:14 tells us that *"every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed."*

For Jesus to be *"tempted in all points like as we are"* (Hebrews 4:15), He had to feel the clamoring of the human flesh. He had to feel the desire to preserve Himself, the desire to avoid pain, and the physical pull of appetite. The difference between Jesus and us is that **He never once surrendered the will to the flesh.**

- **The Wilderness Test (Matthew 4)**: He was tempted on appetite (flesh), presumption (spirit/mind), and power (pride). He met these not as God using divine prerogatives, but as a Man relying on the Word of God.

[DYK🔎] In the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus prayed, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42). This proves Jesus had a human will that naturally shrank from the cross. If He had no human nature that desired self-preservation, there would have been no submission to make. His sacrifice was a conscious, painful choice to deny His human will in favor of the Divine will.

## Section 3: The Two Natures & The New Birth

Here lies the heart of the gospel message for the believer. How did Jesus resist the clamor of the flesh? He possessed a **Divine Nature**—the Spirit of God without measure (John 3:34).

The formula for Christ's victory was:
**Fallen Human Flesh + Divine Spirit/Nature = Absolute Victory over Sin.**

### The Promise to the Believer
This is where the "nature of Christ" becomes "Present Truth" for us. We are told that through His promises, we may become *"partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust"* (2 Peter 1:4).

When a Christian is "born again" (John 3:3-5), they receive the Holy Spirit. We are placed in the exact same position Christ was in during His earthly life:
1. We still have **fallen flesh** (we wait for the redemption of the body at the resurrection - Romans 8:23).
2. We receive a **new nature** (the Divine Spirit within).

> *"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live."* (Romans 8:13)

Jesus is the "Captain of our salvation" (Hebrews 2:10). He went first. He showed that a man, filled with the Spirit of God, can live in sinful flesh and yet keep the Law of God perfectly.

[Q] **"Is it really possible for us to overcome as He overcame?"**
Jesus Himself says so. In Revelation 3:21, He promises: *"To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."* He would not ask us to do something impossible. He provides the same Spirit that sustained Him to sustain us.

## Section 4: Why This Matters (The Atonement)

If Jesus had a nature different from ours—if He was protected from the true power of temptation by a different kind of flesh—then:
1. He is not a fair example for us.
2. He did not legally condemn sin *in the flesh* (Romans 8:3).
3. We could claim that God's law is too hard for humans to keep.

But because He took our nature and won, He vindicated God's character. He proved that the problem isn't the Law, and the problem isn't even the flesh itself—the problem is the separation from God. When humanity is reunited with Divinity (as in Christ, and as in the born-again believer), righteousness is the result.

## Conclusion

The beauty of the Incarnation is not just that God saved us, but *how* He saved us. He did not pull us up with a rope from a distance; He climbed down into the pit, took on our liabilities, and walked the path of obedience to show us the way.

### Key Takeaways:

1.  **Identification**: Jesus took the seed of Abraham—our flesh, with its infirmities and liabilities, yet remained absolutely sinless.
2.  **Power**: He overcame sin not by His own inherent power as the Son of God, but by relying on the Father, using the same Holy Spirit available to us.
3.  **Application**: Being "born again" means receiving the Divine Nature. This gives us the power to resist the flesh, just as Jesus did. We can do all things through Christ who strengthens us.

_**Scripture for Meditation:** "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me." — Galatians 2:20_
