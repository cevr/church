### Introduction (5 min)
- The Universal Question: Why pain, evil, suffering? Where did it start?
- Not random chance, but a cosmic conflict rooted in choices.
- Aim: Trace sin's origin, understand God's character (Love - 1 John 4:8) amidst the controversy, and see His plan for restoration.
- Introduce Central Verse: 1 John 4:8 - God's fundamental nature.

### Main Content Section 1: The Origin - Perfection Marred (10 min)
- Heaven's Initial State: Perfect harmony, governed by love.
- The Highest Created Being: Lucifer, the Covering Cherub (Ezek 28:14).
- The Seed of Rebellion: Pride and Self-Exaltation.
  - Isaiah 14:12-14 - "I will ascend... I will be like the most High."
  - Ezekiel 28:15 - "Thou wast perfect... till iniquity was found in thee."
  - Ezekiel 28:17 - "Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty..."
  - `- [WB]: Lucifer ("Light-bearer") -> Pride (Isa 14:13-14) -> Iniquity Found (Ezek 28:15) -> Satan ("Adversary")`
  - `- [RQ]: What desire replaced love for God in Lucifer's heart? (Isa 14:13-14)`
  - `- [EGW]: 'Sin originated with him who, next to Christ, had been most honored of God and was highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of heaven. Lucifer, “son of the morning,” was first of the covering cherubs...' (PP 35.1)
- Defining Sin: Transgression of God's Law (1 John 3:4).
  - `- [WB]: Sin = Lawlessness (1 John 3:4) = Rebellion against God's Government of Love`
  - `- [EB]: Jude 1:6 (Angels kept not their first estate - consequence of choosing rebellion)`

### Main Content Section 2: The Conflict Spreads - Why Not Immediate Destruction? [*] (12 min)
- War in Heaven: Open conflict erupts.
  - Revelation 12:7-9 - Michael (Christ) and His angels vs. the Dragon (Satan) and his angels.
  - Satan cast out to Earth (Rev 12:9).
  - `- [RQ]: What does this heavenly war reveal about the nature of sin? (It's active opposition to God)`
- Why Didn't God Destroy Satan Instantly?
  - 1. God's Character is Love (1 John 4:8): Love doesn't coerce; forced obedience is worthless.
  - 2. Principle of Free Will: God desires willing allegiance from all creatures (Joshua 24:15).
     - `- [WB]: God's Government = Love + Freedom | Satan's Accusation = God is Tyrannical`
     - `- [Aside]: Imagine the loyal angels. Instant destruction might raise questions: 'Was Satan right? Is God hiding something?' God's way allows truth to be revealed.`
  - 3. Vindication of God's Justice & Law: To destroy Satan would appear to confirm his charges. The universe needed to see the true results of rebellion vs. obedience.
     - `- [RQ]: How does allowing the controversy to unfold ultimately serve to vindicate God's character more fully than immediate destruction would have? (Rom 3:4)`
     - `- [EB]: Romans 3:4 (That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.)`
- The Test on Earth: Transfer of the conflict.
  - Genesis 3:1-6 - Satan tempts Adam and Eve, questioning God's Word and character.
  - Choice: They exercised free will, doubted God, and disobeyed.
  - `- [WB]: Gen 3: Temptation (Doubt God's Word) -> Choice (Disobey) -> Consequence (Sin/Suffering/Separation)`
  - Consequences Introduced: Suffering, toil, death (Gen 3:16-19). Our suffering stems from this initial choice and continued sin.

### Main Content Section 3: The Great Controversy Unfolds - God's Solution (12 min)
- Why Does Sin Continue? The Cosmic Demonstration.
  - God allows sin to run its course to fully reveal its destructive nature (selfishness, suffering, death).
  - This demonstrates the goodness of God's law and the righteousness of His character to the universe.
  - `- [RQ]: How does the state of our world (Rom 8:22) serve as evidence against Satan's claims about God's government?`
  - `- [EGW]: 'God permitted Satan to carry forward his work until the spirit of disaffection ripened into active revolt. It was necessary for his plans to be fully developed, that their true nature and tendency might be seen by all.' (PP 41.3)
  - `- [EB]: Job 1 & 2 (Earth as a theater for the cosmic conflict)`
- God's Active Response: Redemption, Not Abandonment.
  - Immediate Promise: Genesis 3:15 - The Seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head.
  - Ultimate Sacrifice: John 3:16 - God gave His Son, entering our suffering to provide a cure.
     - `- [WB]: The Cross: God's Answer to Sin & Suffering -> Reveals His Love & Justice`
  - Salvation as Restoration & Education: God's plan isn't just forgiveness, but restoring His image in us (2 Cor 3:18).
     - This involves unlearning sin's ways and learning God's ways through His Word and Spirit (Eph 4:22-24, Rom 12:2).
     - `- [RQ]: Seeing God's love at the cross (Rom 5:8), how does this motivate us in the educational process of overcoming sin?`
     - `- [Aside]: Sin is a disease we chose. Christ provides the cure (His life, death, resurrection, mediation). Accepting Him begins the healing process (restoration), requiring our cooperation (education in righteousness).`
     - `- [EB]: Romans 5:8 (God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.)`
- Sin Quarantined: For now, the full display of sin is largely confined to Earth.
- The Final Vindication: Truth Triumphs.
  - Philippians 2:10-11 - Every knee *will* bow, acknowledging Christ's Lordship and God's justice.
  - Revelation 21:4 - Sin, suffering, and death will be eradicated forever.
  - `- [WB]: End Result: God Vindicated -> Sin Eradicated -> Universe Secure (Phil 2:10-11, Rev 21:4)`
  - `- [EB]: Revelation 20:10, 14-15 (The final end of Satan, sin, and unrepentant sinners)`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
- Summary: Sin began with Lucifer's pride, entered Earth through choice, and continues as a demonstration phase in the Great Controversy.
- Suffering is the tragic result of sin, not God's desire. God's character (Love, Justice, Freedom) is central.
- God's Response: Not passive observation, but active redemption through Christ, offering restoration.
- Our Position: We live in the midst of this controversy. Our choices matter.
- The Call: Choose God's side. Accept His sacrifice. Engage in the process of restoration – the 'True Education' of unlearning sin and learning righteousness through His power.
- Final Thought: The question isn't just 'Why suffering?' but 'What is God doing about it?' The Cross is the answer. Will you accept His solution and be restored?
