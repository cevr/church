### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Prayer
- The Age-Old Question: Faith vs. Works? Often misunderstood.
- Introduce Romans 5:3-5 as a key to understanding the _relationship_ through
  character development.
- Frame: God's goal is **restoration** of His image (Gen 1:26-27), an
  **educational process** involving faith, trials, and character.
- Central Proposition: True faith, empowered by Christ within, inevitably
  produces works as evidence of inner transformation and character development,
  leading to hope.

### Main Content Section 1: Foundation: Grace, Faith, and Works (10 min)

- **Salvation's Source:** Grace through Faith
  - Ephesians 2:8-9 - Saved by grace through faith, not of works. Foundational
    truth.
  - [RQ]: If salvation is not _of_ works, what role do they play? (Eph 2:9-10)
- **Faith's Evidence:** Good Works
  - Ephesians 2:10 - Created _unto_ good works. Works are the _purpose_ and
    _result_, not the _means_ of salvation.
  - [WB]: Diagram: GRACE -> FAITH -> SALVATION -> GOOD WORKS (Eph 2:8-10)
  - James 2:17-18, 26 - Faith without works is dead, non-existent.
  - [RQ]: How does James 2 complement Paul's teaching in Ephesians 2? What is
    'dead' faith? (James 2:17-18, 26)
  - [Aside]: Like breathing is evidence of life but doesn't cause life, good
    works are evidence of true faith but don't cause salvation. Faith receives
    life from Christ.
- **Faith's Motive:** Love
  - Galatians 5:6 - The only faith that avails is "faith which worketh by love."
  - [EB]: 1 John 4:19 (We love Him because He first loved us - source of loving
    obedience)

### Main Content Section 2: The Process: Tribulation, Character, Hope [*] (12 min)

- **The Divine Classroom:** Tribulation
  - Romans 5:3a - "...we glory in tribulations also..."
  - [RQ]: Why would Paul 'glory' in hardship? What is God's purpose in allowing
    trials? (Rom 5:3b)
  - [EGW]: 'Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen methods of discipline and
    His appointed conditions of success.' (MH 471.1)
- **The Educational Outcome:** Character Development
  - Romans 5:3b-4 - "knowing that tribulation worketh patience; And patience,
    experience [dokimē - proven character]; and experience, hope..."
  - [WB]: Flowchart: Tribulation -> Patience -> Experience
    (Character/Provenness) -> Hope (Rom 5:3-4)
  - This is God's **educational process** for **restoring** His image.
  - 2 Peter 1:5-8 - Add virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness,
    brotherly kindness, charity. Building character step-by-step.
  - [RQ]: How does this process in Romans 5 mirror the 'adding' of virtues in 2
    Peter 1? What does 'experience' or 'proven character' mean practically? (Rom
    5:3-4, 2 Pet 1:5-8)
  - [EB]: James 1:2-4 (Count trials joy... patience... perfect and entire,
    wanting nothing - link to character perfection)
  - [EB]: Hebrews 12:11 (Chastening yields peaceable fruit of righteousness -
    educational aspect)
- **The Result:** Hope
  - Romans 5:4b - "...and experience, hope..."
  - This hope isn't wishful thinking; it's confident expectation born from
    experiencing God's faithfulness _through_ trials and seeing character
    develop.

### Main Content Section 3: The Power Source: Christ Within (12 min)

- **The Source of Enduring Hope:** God's Love via the Spirit
  - Romans 5:5 - "And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed
    abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us."
  - The hope generated through character isn't self-made; it's rooted in God's
    love poured into us.
  - [RQ]: How does the Holy Spirit's work (Rom 5:5) connect the character
    development (v. 4) to the hope? (Rom 5:4-5)
- **The Indwelling Secret:** Christ in You
  - Colossians 1:27 - "...Christ in you, the hope of glory."
  - This is the core reality: Christ Himself, dwelling in the believer by the
    Spirit, IS the hope and the power for transformation.
  - [WB]: CHRIST IN YOU (Col 1:27) = HOPE (Rom 5:4-5) = POWER FOR CHARACTER
    (Restoration)
  - [EGW]: 'Christ abiding in the soul is a transforming power, and His presence
    will be revealed in the character.' (RH, Aug 15, 1893, par. 8)
  - [Aside]: Trying to develop character without Christ is like trying to power
    a device without plugging it in. He is the source of life and transformation
    (John 15:5).
- **Living the Reality:** Faith Working by Love
  - Galatians 2:20 - "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not
    I, but Christ liveth in me..."
  - This indwelling Christ empowers the "faith which worketh by love" (Gal 5:6).
  - [RQ]: How does understanding 'Christ in you' practically change how we face
    trials and pursue character development (our 'True Education')? (Col 1:27,
    Gal 2:20)
  - [EB]: John 15:4-5 (Abide in Me... without Me ye can do nothing - fruit/works
    depend on connection)
  - [EB]: Revelation 14:12 (Patience of the saints... keep commandments... faith
    _of_ Jesus - character needed for final generation, empowered by His faith
    within)

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** True biblical faith is not passive assent but active trust in
  Christ, leading to salvation by grace. This faith, when genuine, embraces
  God's **educational process** through trials (Rom 5:3-4), resulting in
  **character restoration** (provenness). The power for this transformation and
  the resulting hope comes from **Christ dwelling within** by the Holy Spirit
  (Col 1:27, Rom 5:5). Works are the natural fruit, the evidence of this inner
  reality (Eph 2:10, James 2). This is faith _that works_ by love.
- **Relevance:** In these last days, understanding and experiencing this reality
  is crucial for developing the character needed to stand firm (Rev 14:12) and
  reflect God's image fully.
- **Appeal:** Embrace the trials as God's classroom. Surrender daily to allow
  Christ to dwell richly within you (Eph 3:17). Cooperate with His
  **restorative, educational** work. Let your faith be evidenced by a
  transformed character, rooted in His love, giving you a hope that does not
  disappoint.
- Closing Prayer
