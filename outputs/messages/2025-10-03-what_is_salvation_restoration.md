### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- The Universal Question: What does it mean to be saved?
- Common Answers: Forgiveness? Heaven? Fire escape?
- Introduce Central Verse: Matthew 1:21 - What does "save His people _from_
  their sins" truly mean? **(RQ)**
- Purpose: To explore the biblical depth of salvation – not just forgiveness,
  but transformation and restoration.
- [Write on board: Salvation = ?]

### Section 1: Common Misconceptions vs. Biblical Purpose (10 min)

- **Misconception 1: Salvation is ONLY forgiveness.**
  - Necessary starting point, but not the end goal (Psalm 51:1-2, 10 - Blot
    out... create a clean heart).
  - Danger: Cheap grace? License to continue in sin? **(RQ)** (Rom 6:1-2)
- **Misconception 2: Salvation is freedom TO sin (liberty = license).**
  - Contrast with biblical liberty: Freedom _from_ sin's power (John 8:34-36).
  - **Titus 2:11-14:** Grace appears... teaching us what?
    - [Write on board: Grace Teaches (Titus 2:11-14)]
    - Deny ungodliness & worldly lusts.
    - Live soberly, righteously, godly _in this present world_.
    - Purify a people _zealous for good works_.
  - Grace empowers obedience, doesn't excuse disobedience.
- **Biblical Purpose Stated:** Matthew 1:21 - Salvation _from_ sin itself, not
  just its penalty.
  - [Update board: Salvation = Freedom FROM Sin (Matt 1:21)]
  - **John 8:11:** Jesus' words to the woman caught in adultery: "Go, and sin no
    more."
    - Forgiveness offered, but linked to a changed life.
    - Is this command realistic without divine power? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Salvation as Restoration to God's Image [*] (12 min)

- **The Original Design:**
  - **Genesis 1:26-27:** Created in God's image.
    - What does this image entail? (Character, righteousness, relationship)
    - [Whiteboard: God's Image (Gen 1:26-27) -> Character]
  - Sin marred this image (Rom 3:23 - Fall short of the glory/character of God).
- **The Goal of Redemption:** Restoration of that image.
  - Not just legal pardon, but moral transformation.
  - Colossians 3:9-10: Put off the old man... put on the new man, renewed...
    after the image of Him that created him.
  - [Analogy: A shattered mirror - forgiveness cleans the pieces, restoration
    puts the image back together.]
  - **Romans 8:3-4:** God sent His Son... that the righteousness of the law
    might be fulfilled _in_ us.
    - Not just _for_ us (justification), but _in_ us
      (sanctification/restoration).
    - [Whiteboard: Law fulfilled FOR us (Justification) + IN us
      (Restoration/Sanctification) - Rom 8:3-4]
- **Practical Restoration:**
  - How does God restore His image in us daily? **(RQ)** (2 Cor 3:18 -
    Beholding... changed into the same image)
  - Requires cooperation: Yielding to the Spirit, choosing obedience through His
    power.
  - [Aside: Our daily choices are like brushstrokes on the canvas of our
    character. Are we letting the Master Artist restore His image, or are we
    smudging the picture with self-will?]

### Section 3: The Law's Role in Restoration (12 min)

- **If salvation is restoration, what is the standard?**
  - The Law reveals God's character (the image we are restored to).
  - Psalm 19:7 - The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.
  - [Whiteboard: Law = God's Character = Standard for Restoration (Ps 19:7)]
- **The Law is Not the Enemy:**
  - It diagnoses the problem (sin) (Rom 3:20, Rom 7:7).
  - It shows the path of righteousness, the 'shape' of the restored image.
  - [Metaphor: The law is like the blueprint for the restoration project. It
    shows what the finished building should look like.]
- **Faith and the Law:**
  - **Romans 3:31:** Does faith abolish the law?
    - [Write on board: Faith Establishes Law (Rom 3:31)]
    - How? **(RQ)** Faith connects us to Christ, who empowers us to live in
      harmony with the law (Rom 8:4).
    - True faith leads to love for God's standard (Psalm 119:97 - O how love I
      thy law!).
- **Living the Restored Life:**
  - Obedience flows from a changed heart, empowered by grace (Ezek 36:26-27 -
    New heart... cause you to walk in my statutes).
  - It's evidence of salvation, not the means of earning it.
  - [Aside: Think of God's law like the banks of a river. They don't impede the
    flow; they channel the life-giving water purposefully. True freedom is found
    within God's loving boundaries.]
  - Practical Steps: Daily surrender, prayer for power (1 Peter 5:7), study of
    the Word (the blueprint), choosing God's way moment by moment.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Salvation isn't just forgiveness or a ticket to heaven. It's God's
  amazing plan to save us _from_ our sins (Matt 1:21) and restore us fully to
  His image (Gen 1:27, Col 3:10).
- The Law is our friend: It reveals God's character and the beauty of the life
  He wants to restore in us.
- Grace (Titus 2:11-14) is the power source for this transformation.
- **The Invitation:**
  - Do you desire more than just forgiveness? Do you long for freedom _from_
    sin's power? **(RQ)**
  - Embrace the true meaning of salvation – a daily process of restoration by
    faith in Christ.
  - Invitation to accept Christ not only as Savior _from penalty_ but as Lord
    who saves _from sin itself_.
  - Commit to cooperating with Him in the restoration process this week.
- Final Prayer
