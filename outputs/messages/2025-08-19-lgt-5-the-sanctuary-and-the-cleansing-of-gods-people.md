### Introduction (5 min)

-   God's plan of salvation is not haphazard; it follows a divine blueprint.
-   Exodus 25:8-9 - God commanded a sanctuary to be built, "according to all that I shew thee, after the pattern."
-   [RQ]: If the earthly was a pattern, what was it a pattern *of*? (Heb 8:5)
-   This pattern reveals the entire process of salvation, from the cross to the final eradication of sin.
-   Introducing our central text, Daniel 8:14 - A time prophecy pointing to the final phase of this plan: a "cleansing."
-   [WB]: Title: The Sanctuary: God's Blueprint for Restoration

### Main Content Section 1: The Earthly Pattern (10 min)

-   **The Two-Phase Ministry:**
    -   Daily Service: Transfer of confessed sin *into* the sanctuary through blood. (Leviticus 4:27-31)
    -   Yearly Service (Day of Atonement): Final removal and cleansing of all accumulated sin *from* the sanctuary. (Leviticus 16:16, 20)
    -   [EB]: Leviticus 16:8-10, 21-22 (The two goats: Jehovah's goat for atonement, Azazel/scapegoat for final removal of sin, prefiguring Satan's final punishment).
-   [WB]: Simple Diagram: Courtyard (Altar - Cross) -> Holy Place (Daily Ministry) -> Most Holy Place (Yearly Ministry - Judgment)
-   **The People's Role on the Day of Atonement:**
    -   Leviticus 16:29-30 - A command to "afflict your souls."
    -   [RQ]: What does it mean to "afflict the soul"? Was this just about feeling sad, or was it about deep heart-searching, repentance, and putting away sin? (cf. Isaiah 58:3-7)
    -   This was a day of judgment. Those who did not participate were "cut off." (Lev 23:29)
    -   [Aside]: This earthly service was a visual lesson. Sin is serious, requires a substitute, and must ultimately be dealt with and cleansed from our lives, not just forgiven and forgotten.

### Main Content Section 2: The Heavenly Ministry & Prophecy [*] (12 min)

-   **The Heavenly Reality:**
    -   Hebrews 8:1-2, 5 - Christ is our High Priest in the "true tabernacle," the heavenly sanctuary.
    -   Hebrews 9:23-24 - "It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices."
-   **The Prophetic Timing:**
    -   Daniel 8:14 - "Unto 2300 days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
    -   [EB]: Daniel 9:25 (Provides the starting date for the 2300-day prophecy: 457 B.C., the decree to restore and build Jerusalem).
    -   The cleansing is the antitypical Day of Atonement, a work of judgment.
    -   [WB]: Timeline: 457 B.C. --------------(2300 Years)------------> A.D. 1844
    -   Since 1844, we have been living in the antitypical Day of Atonement.
-   **The Investigative Judgment:**
    -   Revelation 11:19 - John sees the temple in heaven opened, and the Ark of the Covenant is visible. This signifies a shift into the Most Holy Place ministry.
    -   1 Peter 4:17 - "For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God."
    -   [RQ]: Why an "investigative" judgment? To inform God? No, but to demonstrate to the universe the justice and mercy of His decisions for who will be saved.
    -   [EGW]: "As the books of record are opened in the judgment, the lives of all who have believed on Jesus come in review before God... When any have sins remaining upon the books of record, unrepented of and unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book of life..." (GC 483.1)
    -   [EB]: 1 John 2:1 (Assurance: "we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.")

### Main Content Section 3: The Cleansing of the Soul Temple (12 min)

-   **The Heavenly Work and the Earthly Response:**
    -   The cleansing of records in heaven corresponds to a work of cleansing in the lives of God's people on earth.
    -   [EGW]: "While the investigative judgment is going forward in heaven, while the sins of penitent believers are being removed from the sanctuary, there is to be a special work of purification, of putting away of sin, among God’s people upon earth." (GC 425.1)
    -   Malachi 3:1-3 - The Lord comes to His temple to "purify the sons of Levi... that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness."
    -   [RQ]: Who are the priests today? (1 Peter 2:9) This purification is for us.
    -   [WB]: Draw Link: Heavenly Sanctuary Cleansed (Dan 8:14) <---> Earthly Soul Temple Cleansed (Mal 3:3)
-   **True Education: Unlearning Sin, Learning Righteousness:**
    -   This is the practical application of the sanctuary message. It calls us to cooperate with Christ in the work of character restoration.
    -   [EB]: Revelation 3:18-21 (Laodicean message is a call for this very purification and preparation).
    -   2 Corinthians 7:1 - "let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
    -   This is an educational process of identifying and, through Christ's power, overcoming every defect of character.
    -   [WB]: Simple Drawing: A heart with dark spots labeled 'sin.' An arrow labeled 'Christ's Power/Blood' points to it. Another arrow points to a clean heart labeled 'His Image.'
    -   [Aside]: Think of it like a meticulous restoration of a priceless work of art. God, the Master Artist, is painstakingly removing every stain and flaw of sin to restore His original masterpiece—His image in us. This requires our consent and cooperation.
-   **Actionable Steps for Character Cleansing:**
    -   **Unlearn:** Self-reliance, cherished sins, worldly ways of thinking (Romans 12:2).
    -   **Learn:** Total dependence on Christ's righteousness, moment-by-moment surrender, study of the Word to know God's will.
    -   This process prepares a people to stand, reflecting the character of Christ fully. (Rev 14:12)

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   The Sanctuary message is not one of fear, but of incredible hope and urgency.
-   Hebrews 4:15-16 - We have a High Priest who is touched with the feeling of our infirmities. He invites us to come boldly to the throne of grace.
-   The judgment is not about condemnation for the believer, but about vindication and final cleansing.
-   The question today is the same as on the ancient Day of Atonement: Are we "afflicting our souls"? Are we actively cooperating with our High Priest in the cleansing of our soul temple?
-   The work is soon to close. Let us surrender all, that Christ may complete His work of restoration in us, making us fit for heaven.
-   [EB]: Revelation 22:11-12 ("He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me...") - This points to the close of probation, making the present work of cleansing urgent.
