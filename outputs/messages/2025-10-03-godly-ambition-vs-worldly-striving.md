## I. Introduction: The Drive Within (5 min)

- Hook: Universal drive: achieve, build, make a mark. Ambition = powerful force.
- **(RQ)** Is this drive inherently good or bad? How does Scripture guide it?
- Problem: 'Ambition' often negative (selfish). Yet, inaction discouraged.
  Biblical balance?
- Central Verse Intro: Matthew 6:33 - The key filter. Redirects _what_ we seek.
  `[Write on board: Ambition -> ? -> Filter: Matt 6:33]`
- Outline Preview: Examine worldly vs. godly ambition via Scripture; learn
  cultivation.
- Goal: Discern the difference; embrace God-honoring ambition (Kingdom-focused).

## II. Section 1: Worldly Ambition Examined (10 min)

- Biblical Case Studies (Focus: Motivation & Outcome):
  - Tower of Babel (Gen 11:4): "make us a name." Goal: Human glory,
    self-sufficiency, unity _apart_ from God. Outcome: Confusion, scattering (v.
    7-8).
    `[Aside: Interesting how the desire "to make a name" echoes through history, even today in branding and legacy building. God's concern wasn't the building itself, but the *motive* of self-glorification apart from Him.]`
  - Simon Magus (Acts 8:18-20): Tried to _buy_ spiritual power. Goal:
    Influence/status via wrong means, for self. Outcome: Sharp rebuke, warning
    (v. 20-23).
  - Diotrephes (3 John 1:9): "loves to have the preeminence." Goal: Personal
    control, position over God's people. Outcome: Rejection of apostles,
    division (v. 10).
- Identifying Characteristics (Derived from Cases):
  - Motivation: Self (glory, power, wealth, status, recognition).
    `[Write on board: Worldly Ambition -> SELF (Glory, Power, Status)]`
  - Methods: Often competitive, manipulative, ignores ethics/God's will.
  - Focus: Earthly, temporary results.
- Scriptural Assessment:
  - Vanity, futility (Eccl 2:11).
  - Leads away from God.
- **(RQ)** How do these motivations (making a name, seeking preeminence, buying
  influence) appear today?
- Brief Concept: Like building on sand (ref Matt 7:26-27) - impressive exterior,
  faulty foundation.
- Core Point: Self-centered ambition is ultimately futile and spiritually
  damaging.

## III. Section 2: Godly Ambition Defined (12 min) [*]

- Biblical Case Studies (Focus: Motivation & Goal):
  - Paul (Phil 3:12-14): "I press toward the mark..." Goal: Spiritual maturity,
    God's high calling in Christ. Motivation: Knowing Christ (v. 8-10).
    `[Aside: Remember Paul's background! From zealous persecutor (Acts 8:3) to passionately pursuing Christ (Phil 3). God truly redirects ambition when we surrender to Him.]`
  - Nehemiah (Neh 2:3-5, 17-18): Burdened for Jerusalem. Goal: Rebuild _for
    God's honor_, rally people to God's work. Motivation: God's mission, concern
    for His people/reputation.
  - Jesus (John 4:34): "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me..." Goal:
    Fulfill Father's will perfectly. Motivation: Complete obedience and love for
    the Father.
- Identifying Characteristics (Derived from Cases):
  - Motivation: God's glory, His will, love for Him & others, advancing His
    kingdom. `[Write on board: Godly Ambition -> GOD (Glory, Will, Service)]`
  - Methods: Prayerful dependence, ethical means, collaboration, faithfulness,
    service (1 Pet 4:10-11).
  - Focus: Eternal impact, spiritual growth, blessing others, honoring God.
- Source & Nature:
  - Not self-generated; response to God's call, empowered by Spirit (Phil 2:13 -
    "God...works in you both to will and to do").
  - Grows via relationship with Christ, Word study.
  - **(RQ)** How does understanding God's love/sacrifice (Rom 5:8) reorient our
    desires toward Him?
- Brief Analogy: Channeling a river (drive/talents) through God's design (His
  will/Word) to serve/build His kingdom.
- Core Point: Godly ambition = Spirit-led desire using _all_ for God's purposes
  & glory.

## IV. Section 3: Cultivating Godly Ambition (12 min)

- Need/Question: World promotes self-advancement. How to actively reorient our
  drive toward God's kingdom?
- Biblical Principle: Matthew 6:33 - The divine priority. Seek _first_: 1) God's
  Kingdom (His rule, His agenda) 2) His Righteousness (His character, His way of
  living).
  `[Write on board: Matt 6:33 -> Seek FIRST: 1. God's Kingdom 2. His Righteousness]`
- Bridging to Practice (Exploring Matt 6:33):
  - Not passivity, but _active seeking_ of the _right things_. Transforms _how_
    & _why_ we strive.
  - **(RQ)** What does 'seeking His kingdom' look like in daily choices (job,
    time, money, relationships)? How does it change priorities?
  - **(RQ)** What does 'seeking His righteousness' mean for our character,
    integrity, interactions? (Ref Micah 6:8).
- Actionable Steps (Derived from Matt 6:33 & related principles):
  - 1.  Pray for Purified Motives: Ask God to align desires with His (Ps
        139:23-24). "Lord, help me seek **Your** kingdom first."
  - 2.  Immerse in God's Priorities: Study Scripture to know what God values (2
        Tim 2:15). Let His Word define "success."
  - 3.  Prioritize Service over Status: Use gifts to serve/build up others (Gal
        5:13; Mark 10:43-45). Focus on contribution, not position.
        `[Write on board: Actions: Pray (Motives), Study (Priorities), Serve (Others)]`
- Invitation: Evaluate your driving ambitions this week. Commit one area to
  consciously seeking God's kingdom/righteousness first.

## V. Conclusion & Invitation (6 min)

- Recap: Worldly ambition -> Self -> Vanity. Godly ambition -> God/Others ->
  Purpose. (Ref Whiteboard).
- Centrality of Matt 6:33: Profound simplicity - Prioritize God. Ambitions find
  right place/power.
- **(RQ)** Revisit Phil 3:14 - What "prize" are **you** pressing toward? Is it
  God's high calling?
- Eternal Perspective: Focus on faithfulness & eternal value, not just earthly
  results (2 Cor 4:17-18).
- Gentle Invitation: Don't suppress God-given drive; **redeem** it. Channel
  energy/talents toward His kingdom & righteousness. Ask Him to open your eyes
  (Closing Hymn theme).
- Final Thought: True achievement = aligning life with God's eternal purposes.
  Strive for **that**.
