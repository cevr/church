### Introduction (5 min)
- [WB]: Write “GREAT CONTROVERSY” – circle it
- [RQ]: Why does Revelation 12 alone call Satan “accuser” five times?
- [Aside]: Imagine a courtroom where the entire universe is the jury; God is on trial.

### 1. Where and When Did the Conflict Begin? (10 min)
- Ezekiel 28:12-15 – Lucifer “perfect in beauty” in Eden, the garden of God
  - [WB]: Draw timeline: “Eden of God” → “Fall” → “Cross” → “1844” → “Final Generation”
  - [EGW]: ‘Satan’s rebellion was to be a lesson to the universe through all coming ages.’ (GC 499.3)
- Isaiah 14:12-15 – Five “I wills” reveal root issue: self-exaltation vs. God’s law
  - [RQ]: How do the “I wills” mirror modern self-help slogans?
  - [EB]: Jude 6 (Angels who kept not first estate)

### 2. The Accusations – What Is Satan Really Saying? (12 min) [*]
- Job 1:9-11 – “Doth Job fear God for nought?”
  - [WB]: Two columns: “Satan’s Claim” vs. “God’s Answer”
  - [RQ]: If Satan wins this case, what happens to God’s throne?
- Revelation 12:10 – “Accuser of the brethren… day and night”
  - [EGW]: ‘Satan declared that it was impossible for the sons and daughters of Adam to keep the law of God.’ (1SM 341.2)
- [Aside]: Like a prosecuting attorney filing endless motions; the universe is watching how God responds.

### 3. The Heavenly Courtroom – How God Answers (12 min) [*]
- Job 1:6-12 – Divine council convenes; Satan has limited access
  - [WB]: Sketch Sanctuary: Courtyard → Holy Place → Most Holy Place
- Daniel 7:9-10 – Judgment scene; books opened
  - [EB]: Hebrews 9:23-24 (Heavenly sanctuary needs cleansing)
- 2 Corinthians 5:19 – “God was in Christ, reconciling...”
  - [RQ]: How does the cross answer BOTH justice and mercy?
- [EB]: Revelation 14:6-7 – First Angel’s message ties judgment hour to worship

### 4. Our Part in the Final Verdict (10 min)
- Revelation 12:11 – “They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony”
  - [WB]: List “Blood” + “Word” + “Loving not life unto death”
- [EGW]: ‘The last generation of men is called to give a final demonstration of the power of the gospel.’ (7BC 974.3)
- Actionable steps in the “True Education” of restoration:
  1. Unlearn: self-justifying excuses (Isa 14:13-14)
  2. Learn: Christ’s humility (Phil 2:5-8)
  3. Live: testimony that vindicates God’s character (Rev 12:11)
- [RQ]: If the universe is still watching, what does my daily character say about God’s law?

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
- [WB]: Draw empty cross → filled sanctuary → crown
- Summarize: Satan’s accusations → Christ’s vindication → our cooperation in final generation
- Gentle appeal: Choose today which side you will strengthen in the cosmic court.
