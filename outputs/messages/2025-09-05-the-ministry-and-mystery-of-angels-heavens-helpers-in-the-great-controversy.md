  - [WB]: Draw: Old Man (Eph 4:22) -> Beholding Word (Col 3:16) -> New Man (Eph 4:24) — Angels aid the process (Heb 1:14)
  - [Aside]: Firewalls protect systems by rules; godly habits (Word, prayer, obedience) form spiritual firewalls that block intrusions and keep Heaven’s connection stable.
- Action Steps (Education for Restoration)
  - Based on James 4:7-8; Psalm 34:13-14; Philippians 4:8:
    1) Unlearn: Compromise with known sin; unfiltered media/occult curiosity; anger-pride pathways. (Eph 4:27; Ps 34:13)
    2) Learn/Apply: Daily surrender and Scripture response to temptation (Matt 4:10), praise and gratitude routine (Ps 22:3), thought curation (Phil 4:8), intercessory prayer (Acts 12:5).
    - [WB]: Action Board: Submit • Resist • Replace • Praise • Pray (Jas 4:7-8; Phil 4:8)
  - Promise of Protection
    - Psalm 91:11-12 — Commissioned protection within God’s ways

Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
- Summary:
  - Angels are created, mighty, and sent to aid our salvation (Heb 1:14; Ps 103:20).
  - Two legions labor: holy angels strengthen truth; evil angels push deception (Rev 12:9; Eph 6:12; 2 Cor 11:14).
  - Conditions matter: obedience, prayer, praise, and the Word strengthen Heaven’s encampment (Ps 34:7; Jas 4:7; Ps 22:3).
  - In the judgment-hour, angels witness and assist Heaven’s restoring work (Dan 7:10; Zech 3:1-5).
- Invitation:
  - [RQ]: Will you align your daily habits with Heaven’s helpers and reject every doorway that gives place to the enemy? (Eph 4:27; Jas 4:7)
  - Response: Choose a specific “unlearn” and “learn” step this week to cooperate with Heaven’s education for character restoration.
- Encouragement:
  - [EGW]: “All the hosts of Satan cannot force the weakest soul to sin.” (DA 490.1)
  - Assurance: “The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear Him, and delivereth them.” (Ps 34:7)
