Introduction (6 min)
- Frame the issue: “bare minimum” spirituality vs God’s call to “all your might” (Eccl 9:10; Deut 6:5)
  - Jeremiah 48:10 — God’s work not done “deceitfully” (carelessly, half-heartedly)
  - [WB]: Write: “Bare Minimum” ≠ “All” (Deut 6:5; Eccl 9:10)
  - [RQ]: If God is worthy of all our heart, how can minimal effort represent true love? (Deut 6:5)
- Laodicea named: not cold/hot, but lukewarm (Rev 3:16)
  - [WB]: Thermometer: COLD — LUKEWARM — HOT (Rev 3:16)
- Key thesis: God demands wholehearted excellence; minimal religion carries real consequences (Col 3:23-24; Rev 3:16-19; Jer 48:10)
  - [Aside]: A plant given “bare minimum” water survives but never flowers; God seeks fruit, not mere survival (John 15:8).

Section 1 (6 min) — God’s Standard: Wholehearted Service (Biblical Foundation)
- Colossians 3:23-24 — “Do it heartily… unto the Lord”
  - Key Truth for Restoration: Excellence = motive and might devoted to Christ as Master.
  - [WB]: Key Term: HEARTILY = “from the soul” (Col 3:23)
  - [RQ]: If Christ is the true Boss, what changes on Monday? (Col 3:23-24)
  - [EGW]: “The greatest want of the world is the want of men… who will stand for the right though the heavens fall.” (Ed 57.3)
- Ecclesiastes 9:10 — With all thy might
  - Application: No divided energy in sacred or secular; all is sacred under God (1 Cor 10:31)
  - 1 Corinthians 10:31 — “Whether therefore ye eat, or drink… do all to the glory of God.”
- Deuteronomy 6:5 — Love with “all”
  - Formation: Love fuels diligence; education of the heart produces whole-souled service (Rom 5:5)
  - [WB]: Draw: LOVE (Deut 6:5) -> DILIGENCE (2 Pet 1:5) -> FRUIT (2 Pet 1:8)
- Based on Col 3:23-24, steps (education for restoration):
  - 1. Unlearn: Working for eye-service, minimal compliance (Col 3:22)
  - 2. Learn/Apply: Work as worship; set Christ as Supervisor (pray-task-pray cycle)
  - [WB]: Action Steps: Unlearn “eye-service”; Learn “as to the Lord” (Col 3:22-23)
  - [EB]: Romans 12:11 (Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord)

Section 2 (6 min) — The Peril of Minimum Religion [*] (Examples & Consequences)
- Revelation 3:16-19 — Lukewarm rejected; counsel to buy gold, white raiment, eyesalve
  - [WB]: Draw: GOLD (faith + love) – RAIMENT (Christ’s righteousness) – EYESALVE (spiritual discernment) (Rev 3:18)
  - Scripture anchors for Rev 3:18 symbols:
    - Gold = faith: 1 Peter 1:7 — “Trial of your faith… more precious than of gold”; Galatians 5:6 — “faith which worketh by love.”
    - White raiment = righteousness: Revelation 19:8 — “fine linen… is the righteousness of saints”; Isaiah 61:10 — “garments of salvation… robe of righteousness.”
    - Eyesalve = spiritual discernment/illumination: Ephesians 1:17-18 — “eyes of your understanding being enlightened”; 1 Corinthians 2:14-15 — spiritual man discerns.
  - [RQ]: What does “be zealous therefore, and repent” practically demand today? (Rev 3:19)
  - [EGW]: “Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of Himself in His church.” (COL 69.1)
- Matthew 25:14-30 — The one-talent servant
  - Key observation: Fear + inertia = buried trust; minimal effort judged as “wicked and slothful”
  - Consequence: Loss of talent; outer darkness; heaven measures faithfulness, not capacity
  - [RQ]: What “hole” have I buried my entrusted gift in? (Matt 25:25)
- Genesis 4:3-7 — Cain’s offering (convenience vs obedience)
  - Key: Partial compliance (fruit) vs obedient faith (firstlings + blood)
  - Consequence: No respect upon Cain’s offering; sin desires mastery
  - 1 Samuel 15:22-23 — “To obey is better than sacrifice… rebellion… is as witchcraft.”
- Malachi 1:6-8 — Blemished offerings
  - God’s question: “Offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased?”
  - [RQ]: If we wouldn’t offer it to a boss, why to the King? (Mal 1:8)
- Based on Rev 3 and Matt 25, steps:
  - 1. Unlearn: Safe mediocrity; procrastination cloaked as prudence
  - 2. Learn/Apply: Immediate, faithful use of entrusted gifts; zealous repentance
  - [Aside]: In aviation, “minimums” exist for safety, not to fly sloppy. In discipleship, “minimums” warn, but love goes beyond to excellence in obedience.
  - [EB]: Luke 12:47-48 (Greater light, greater accountability)

Section 3 (7 min) — Excellence as End-Time Preparation [*] (Education for Restoration)
- 2 Peter 1:5-8 — “Giving all diligence… add” (growth ladder)
  - Principle: Restoration by education—active adding, not passive drifting
  - Fruit: Not barren nor unfruitful in knowledge of Christ
  - [WB]: Ladder: Faith -> Virtue -> Knowledge -> Temperance -> Patience -> Godliness -> Brotherly kindness -> Charity (2 Pet 1:5-7)
  - [RQ]: Which rung am I resisting to “add” right now? (2 Pet 1:5-7)
- Hebrews 12:1-2 — Lay aside weights; run with patience; looking unto Jesus
  - Excellence strategy: Remove “weights” (non-sin hindrances) + sins; fix gaze on Jesus
  - [EB]: 1 Corinthians 3:13 (Work tried by fire—quality revealed)
- Revelation 14:12 — Patience of the saints; keep commandments; faith of Jesus
  - Final Generation: Obedient excellence under pressure; faith that works by love
  - [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (Heavenly sanctuary cleansing—IJ urgency for character readiness)
  - [EB]: Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 (Every work brought into judgment—wholeheartedness matters)
- Based on 2 Pet 1 and Heb 12, steps:
  - 1. Unlearn: Drift-learning; “good enough” spiritual routines
  - 2. Learn/Apply: Daily “add” discipline (plan one rung), remove one weight, pursue one obedience today
  - Micro-rhythms: Morning consecration (Rom 12:1), targeted obedience, evening review (Ps 139:23-24)
  - [WB]: “Daily Add One + Drop One” Plan (2 Pet 1:5-7; Heb 12:1-2)

Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
- Summation (verse thread):
  - Col 3:23-24 — Serve Christ with all your might
  - Rev 3:19 — Be zealous and repent; buy gold, raiment, eyesalve
  - 2 Pet 1:5-8 — Diligently add—avoid barrenness
- Final calls:
  - [RQ]: What single “weight” will you lay aside today? What single “virtue” will you add? (Heb 12:1; 2 Pet 1:5)
  - Invitation: Choose excellence for Christ—no more bare minimums; entire surrender for restoration
  - [WB]: Commitment: “No lukewarm: 100% to Jesus” (Col 3:23; Rev 3:16-19)
- Prayer focus: Zealous repentance (Rev 3:19), wholehearted service (Eccl 9:10), steady adding (2 Pet 1:5-8), readiness for the hour (Dan 8:14; Rev 14:12)
