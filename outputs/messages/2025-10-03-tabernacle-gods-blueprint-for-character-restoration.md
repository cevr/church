### Introduction (6 min)

- Exodus 25:8 - God's stated purpose: dwelling with His people
- [WB]: "TABERNACLE = Blueprint for Character Restoration" (Exod 25:8)
- [RQ]: What does it mean that the God of infinite holiness desires to dwell with fallen humanity? (Exod 25:8)
- Theme: The tabernacle's construction reveals God's pattern for restoring His image in sinful hearts
- Connection to restoration: Just as God gave exact specifications for the physical sanctuary, He provides clear instruction for rebuilding His image in us
- Roadmap: Willing heart (foundation), Obedient life (mark), Glory-filled character (result)

### The Foundation: A Willing Heart's Sacrifice and Devotion (12 min)

#### God Initiates, We Respond

- Exodus 25:8 - "let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them"
- [WB]: "God's Initiative: 'That I may DWELL among them'" (Exod 25:8)
- Key truth: God doesn't wait for our perfection—He provides the way and invites willing cooperation
- [RQ]: According to this verse, whose desire comes first—God's to dwell with us, or ours to have Him? (Exod 25:8)

#### The Willing Heart Demonstrates Sacrifice

- Exodus 35:21-22 - "every one whose heart stirred him up...came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold"
- [WB]: "Willing Heart = COSTLY SACRIFICE" (Exod 35:21-22)
- Truth: They gave their precious jewelry—what was costly and dear to them
- This wasn't giving leftovers; this was genuine sacrifice of treasured possessions
- [Aside]: Like releasing grip on what we value most—time, comfort, pride, cherished sins. God's restoration work requires we willingly place our treasures on His altar, trusting His work is worth more than what we surrender.
- [RQ]: What "precious jewelry" of your life—habits, relationships, ambitions—is God asking you to willingly sacrifice for His indwelling? (Exod 35:22)
- [EB]: Mark 10:21-22 (Rich young ruler unwilling to sacrifice his treasure)

#### The Willing Heart Demonstrates Devotion

- Exodus 36:5-7 - "The people bring much more than enough...So the people were restrained from bringing. For the stuff they had was sufficient"
- [WB]: "Willing Heart = OVERFLOWING DEVOTION" (Exod 36:5-7)
- Truth: Their giving didn't stop at "enough"—they gave until restrained
- This reveals hearts fully devoted, not calculating minimum acceptable offering
- Connection to education/restoration: God seeks this same devotion in our character development—not grudging minimum compliance, but eager, overflowing cooperation with His transforming work
- [EGW]: "Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first requisites in preparing a dwelling place for the Most High." (PP 343.3)
- [RQ]: Does our cooperation with God's sanctifying work reflect "just enough" or overflowing devotion? (Exod 36:5-7)
- [EB]: 2 Corinthians 8:1-5 (Macedonian churches' devotion beyond their ability)

#### Summary: The Educational Foundation

- Romans 12:1 - "present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service"
- [WB]: "Foundation for Restoration: WILLING + SACRIFICIAL + DEVOTED" (Rom 12:1)
- Truth: This willing, sacrificial, devoted heart provides the foundation upon which God builds His dwelling place within us
- This is the starting point of True Education—willingness to unlearn attachment to worldly treasures and learn the value of being God's temple

### The Mark: Obedience as Evidence of God's Indwelling (13 min) [*]

#### The Sabbath Sign of Sanctification

- Exodus 31:13 - "it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you"
- [WB]: "SABBATH = SIGN that GOD SANCTIFIES" (Exod 31:13)
- Truth: The Sabbath isn't merely a command to keep—it's a visible sign to the world that God is actively sanctifying us
- This sign marks us as those in whom God dwells and works His restorative education
- [RQ]: How does our faithful Sabbath observance serve as evidence to others that God is dwelling within and sanctifying us? (Exod 31:13)
- [EB]: Ezekiel 20:12, 20 (Sabbath as perpetual sign between God and His people)

#### Exact Obedience: Proof of Divine Presence

- Exodus 39:42-43 - "According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work...as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them"
- [WB]: "EXACT OBEDIENCE = PROOF of God's Spirit Within" (Exod 39:42-43)
- Key insight: Their precise obedience wasn't mere human willpower—it was evidence that God's Spirit was actively working within them
- Connection to education: This is the learning side of restoration—accurately following God's revealed will because His Spirit teaches and empowers us
- [RQ]: What does Israel's exact obedience to God's specifications teach us about how the Holy Spirit works in our sanctification? (Exod 39:42-43)

#### Obedience Makes God's Dwelling Visible

- 1 John 3:24 - "he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us"
- [WB]: "KEEPING Commandments = VISIBLE MARK of God's Indwelling" (1 John 3:24)
- Truth: Our loyal obedience becomes the visible mark that identifies us as God's dwelling place
- Just as the glory cloud visibly marked the tabernacle as God's dwelling, our character obedience visibly marks us as His temples
- [EB]: John 14:15, 21 (Love demonstrated through obedience; obedience results in manifestation)
- [RQ]: In what practical ways does our obedience serve as a "mark" that reveals to the world that God dwells within us? (1 John 3:24)

#### The Mind Renewal Process

- Romans 12:2 - "be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God"
- [WB]: "Mind Renewal → Proves God's Will → MARKS Us as His" (Rom 12:2)
- Truth: Sanctification is God's educational process—unlearning conformity to the world's ways, learning His perfect will, proving it through our transformed choices
- This mental transformation becomes visible through our obedient choices—the mark of God's indwelling
- [EB]: Colossians 3:9-10 (Put off old man, renewed in knowledge after image of Creator)

### The Result: Glory-Filled Character (8 min)

#### The Glory Fills the Prepared Temple

- Exodus 40:34-35 - "Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle"
- [WB]: "Willing Heart → Marked Obedience → GLORY FILLS" (Exod 40:34-35)
- [EGW]: "With deep emotion the people beheld the token that the work of their hands was accepted...they murmured low, earnest words of gratitude that God had condescended to abide with them." (PP 349.2)
- Truth: When the preparation is complete—willing sacrifice, devoted cooperation, exact obedience—God's glory fills the dwelling He has been building
- This is the goal of True Education: a character so fully prepared through the unlearning of sin and learning of righteousness that God's glory can fully inhabit it
- [RQ]: How does this vision of God's glory filling the completed tabernacle shape our understanding of what God desires to accomplish in our character? (Exod 40:34-35)

#### Christ: The Perfect Example

- John 1:14 - "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth"
- [WB]: "Christ = Perfect MARK of God Dwelling in Humanity" (John 1:14)
- Greek connection: "dwelt" = literally "tabernacled"
- Truth: Christ's life was the perfect demonstration of God dwelling fully in human flesh—willing sacrifice, complete devotion, exact obedience, glory-filled character
- He is both our pattern and our power for this same restoration
- [EB]: Philippians 2:6-8 (Christ's willing sacrifice and obedient devotion unto death)
- [RQ]: How does Christ's perfect example of God "tabernacling" in humanity give us hope for our own character restoration? (John 1:14)

#### The Ultimate Purpose: Eternal Dwelling

- 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord"
- [WB]: "Beholding His Glory → Changed to His Image → From Glory to Glory" (2 Cor 3:18)
- Truth: The entire restoration process—willing heart, marked obedience, glory-filled character—is preparing us to dwell eternally with God, fully restored to His image
- This is why character preparation matters urgently in these last days—God is completing His sanctuary work in His people

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

#### Summary of the Blueprint

- God's pattern revealed: Willing, sacrificial, devoted heart → Marked by exact obedience → Filled with His glory
- [WB]: "The MARK of God's Temple: LOYAL OBEDIENCE" (Exod 31:13, 1 John 3:24)
- This isn't merely outward conformity—it's the visible evidence that God's Spirit dwells within, actively sanctifying and restoring His image in us

#### The Character Focus

- Our obedience to God's commands—especially the sign of the Sabbath—becomes the visible mark to the world that we are His dwelling place
- This mark is being formed through True Education: unlearning the world's ways, learning God's ways, proving His perfect will through transformed choices

#### The Urgent Appeal
