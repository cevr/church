### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with the scene: Jesus tested by the lawyer (Matthew 22:35-36).
- The question: "Which is the _great_ commandment in the law?" (v. 36)
  - Context: Rabbinic debates often tried to prioritize or summarize the 613
    laws.
- Jesus' profound answer cuts through complexity (Matthew 22:37-40).
  - **(RQ)** Why did Jesus choose _these_ two commandments? What makes them
    'great'?
- Thesis: These two commandments aren't just rules; they are the _foundation_
  and _summary_ of God's entire revealed will for humanity, rooted in His
  character of love.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matthew 22:37-40 - The Two Great Commandments]`

### Section 1: The Question & The Source (8 min)

- **The Need:** Understanding the _core principle_ behind God's law, often
  missed in focusing on individual rules.
- **Biblical Principle (Deut 6:4-5):** The foundation starts with God Himself
  and our relationship to Him.
  - "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord" (v. 4) - Unity, sovereignty.
  - "And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
    soul, and with all thy might." (v. 5)
  - `[Whiteboard: Deut 6:5 - LOVE GOD - Heart, Soul, Might]`
  - This wasn't new; Jesus quoted the foundational Shema prayer.
- **Biblical Principle (Lev 19:18):** The second commandment also has deep OT
  roots.
  - Context: Part of the holiness code, practical laws for community living.
  - "...thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the Lord." (v. 18b)
  - `[Whiteboard: Lev 19:18 - LOVE NEIGHBOR as thyself]`
  - ** (RQ)** Why link loving neighbor directly to "I am the Lord"? (Connects
    horizontal duty to vertical relationship).
- Jesus connects these two, previously often seen as distinct categories, as
  inseparable.

### Section 2: Commandment 1 - Loving God Wholly (8 min) [*]

- **Unpacking Matthew 22:37:** "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
  heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind."
  - **Heart:** Affections, inner being, core desires (Prov 4:23).
  - **Soul:** Life force, entire person, conscious self (Gen 2:7).
  - **Mind:** Intellect, understanding, thoughts (Rom 12:2).
  - `[Whiteboard: ALL = Heart (Affections) + Soul (Life) + Mind (Intellect)]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** What does loving God with _everything_ look like?
  - Not just emotion, but conscious choice and commitment.
  - Prioritizing Him in decisions, time, resources (Matt 6:33).
  - Seeking to understand His Word and will (Psalm 119:97).
  - Obedience flowing from love, not just duty (John 14:15).
  - `[Analogy (from Deut 6:5 'might'): Like investing all your strength/resources into what you value most.]`
- **Actionable Steps (derived from the verse's totality):**
  1.  Daily dedicate time for prayer/study (Mind/Heart).
  2.  Consciously choose thoughts honoring God (Mind).
  3.  Align actions/priorities with His known will (Soul/Might).
- **Obstacle:** Distractions, divided affections (James 1:8). **Solution:**
  Prayer for undivided heart (Psalm 86:11).

### Section 3: Commandment 2 - Loving Neighbor Practically (12 min)

- **Unpacking Matthew 22:39:** "And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love
  thy neighbour as thyself."
  - "Like unto it": Equal importance, inseparable from the first.
  - "Neighbor": Who is my neighbor? (Luke 10:29-37 - Parable of Good Samaritan).
    Anyone in need we can help.
  - "As thyself": The standard - genuine care for their well-being, mirroring
    our natural self-concern.
    - Not selfish love, but recognizing their value as God's creation.
    - `[Whiteboard: LOVE NEIGHBOR (Anyone in need) AS THYSELF (Genuine care/value)]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** How does this love manifest?
  - **1 John 4:20-21:** Love for God is _proven_ by love for brother/neighbor.
    - "If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar..."
      (v. 20)
    - `[Write Question (from 1 John 4:20): How can our actions towards others reveal the truth about our love for God?]`
  - Practical kindness, fairness, compassion, forgiveness (Eph 4:32).
  - Seeking their highest good, including spiritual well-being (Gal 6:10).
  - `[Aside: Our interactions in church, at work, online – these are all opportunities to live out Lev 19:18 & Matt 22:39. It's like a daily test of whether our vertical claim matches our horizontal reality.]`
- **Actionable Steps (derived from Lev 19:18, Luke 10, 1 John 4):**
  1.  Identify one person this week to show practical kindness (Good Samaritan
      principle).
  2.  Practice active listening and empathy in conversations (Reflecting value).
  3.  Pray for someone you find difficult to love (Seeking God's perspective).

### Section 4: The Hinge - Law, Prophets, and Love (6 min) [*]

- **Unpacking Matthew 22:40:** "On these two commandments hang all the law and
  the prophets."
  - "Hang": Like a door on hinges. The entire OT revelation depends on and
    points to these principles.
  - `[Draw simple diagram: Hinge (Love God/Neighbor) supporting Door (Law & Prophets)]`
  - The Law (first 5 books) and Prophets (rest of OT) explained _how_ to love
    God and neighbor in specific contexts.
- **Biblical Principle (Romans 13:8-10):** Love fulfills the law's _intent_.
  - Listing commandments (adultery, killing, stealing...) then summarizing:
    "...it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy
    neighbour as thyself." (v. 9)
  - "Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of
    the law." (v. 10)
  - ** (RQ)** Does this mean the specific commandments don't matter anymore?
    (No, it means love is the _motivation_ and _goal_ behind them. True love
    _won't_ violate them).
- **Connecting to Character:** God's law is a transcript of His character, which
  is love (1 John 4:8 - "God is love"). Obedience motivated by love restores
  God's image in us.
  - `[Whiteboard: Law = God's Character = LOVE -> Obedience from Love = Restoration]`
- `[Aside: Sometimes we focus so much on the 'don'ts' of the law that we miss the overarching 'do' – actively love. It's like focusing on the fence posts and ignoring the beautiful garden they protect and define.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Jesus simplified the complex – it all comes down to Love.
  - Love for God (Vertical - Deut 6:5, Matt 22:37).
  - Love for Neighbor (Horizontal - Lev 19:18, Matt 22:39).
  - These are the foundation upon which everything else rests (Matt 22:40, Rom
    13:10).
- **The Source of Love:** We can only love because He first loved us (1 John
  4:19).
  - True love (agape) is a fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22), not just human
    effort.
- **Practical Significance:** This isn't just theology; it's the blueprint for
  relationships, community, and reflecting Christ.
  - It addresses the core need for connection (with God) and community (with
    others).
- **Invitation:**
  - ** (RQ)** Are you trying to live the Christian life based on rules, or
    rooted in love for God that overflows to others?
  - Commit today to ask God for a deeper experience of His love, empowering you
    to fulfill these two great commandments.
  - Choose one actionable step from today's study to implement this week,
    relying on His strength.
- Final Prayer: Ask for the Holy Spirit to pour God's love into our hearts (Rom
  5:5) so we can truly live out these foundational commands.
