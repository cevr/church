### **Introduction (5 min)**

-   Start with a question: Is God's law a set of arbitrary rules, or is it a revelation of who He is?
-   The great controversy began with an attack on God's law and His character. Satan claimed the law was restrictive and couldn't be kept.
-   This study explores the law not as a burden, but as the foundation of God's government and the framework for our restoration.
-   [RQ]: Why would a government of perfect love *require* a foundation of unchanging law? (Ex 20)
-   Thesis: The law is a transcript of God's character, and our relationship to it reveals our relationship to Him.

### **Main Section 1: The Eternal Transcript (12 min)**

-   **The Law Given at Sinai: A Foundation for Relationship**
    -   Exodus 20:1-2 - God introduces Himself first as Redeemer ("brought thee out of... bondage"). The law is given to a people already saved.
    -   Exodus 20:3-17 - A quick overview of the two tables: Duty to God (1-4) and Duty to Man (5-10).
    -   [Aside]: A nation's constitution isn't a burden; it's the framework that protects freedom and defines the nation's values. God's law is the constitution of His eternal kingdom, designed for our happiness and protection.

-   **The Law's Divine Attributes: A Reflection of God**
    -   Psalm 19:7-9 - Unpack the descriptors of the law.
        -   `Perfect, converting the soul`: The law is the standard for the educational process of restoration.
        -   `Sure, making wise the simple`: It is a reliable guide.
        -   `Right, rejoicing the heart`: True joy is found within its boundaries.
        -   `Pure, enlightening the eyes`: It reveals truth and error.
    -   [WB]: Two Columns: **Law's Attributes (Ps 19)** -> **God's Character**
        -   Perfect -> He is Perfect (Matt 5:48)
        -   Holy -> He is Holy (Lev 19:2)
        -   Just -> He is Just (Deut 32:4)
        -   Good -> He is Good (Ps 34:8)
    -   [EGW]: "The law of God is as sacred as God Himself. It is a revelation of His will, a transcript of His character, the expression of divine love and wisdom." (PP 52.2)
    -   [EB]: Daniel 7:25 (Prophetic context for the historical attack on God's law by the "little horn" power).

### **Main Section 2: Christ, the Law's Vindicator [*] (12 min)**

-   **Christ Did Not Abolish, He Magnified**
    -   Matthew 5:17 - "Think not that I am come to destroy the law... but to fulfil."
    -   [WB]: "Fulfill" (Gk. *pleroo*) = To fill up, to bring to full expression, to live out its true meaning.
    -   [RQ]: If Christ perfectly kept the law, what does His life *teach* us about the law's true spiritual meaning beyond just the words? (Matt 5:17-19)
    -   Matthew 5:21-22, 27-28 - Christ applies the law to the thoughts and intents of the heart, restoring its spiritual depth. This is *True Education* in the principles of the kingdom.
    -   [EB]: Isaiah 42:21 ("He will magnify the law, and make it honourable.") - A Messianic prophecy Christ fulfilled.

-   **The Law Established by Faith**
    -   Romans 3:31 - "Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law."
    -   Faith in Christ leads to a transformation that brings us *into* harmony with the law, not freedom *from* it.
    -   Romans 7:12, 14 - "Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good... the law is spiritual."
    -   [Aside]: The law is like a mirror (James 1:23-25). It shows us the dirt on our face (sin) but cannot clean it. For that, we need the water and soap (Christ's blood and Spirit). It reveals our need for a Savior.

### **Main Section 3: The Law in the Heart and in the End (10 min)**

-   **The New Covenant Promise: An Internalized Standard**
    -   Jeremiah 31:33 - "But this shall be the covenant... I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts."
    -   This is the ultimate goal of salvation: the restoration of God's image and principles within us, not just as an external code.
    -   [WB]: Diagram: Stone Tablets (Old) -> Cross -> Heart (New Covenant - Jer 31:33) = Character Restoration
    -   [EB]: Romans 8:3-4 (What the law couldn't do—provide power—God did by sending Christ, so the law's righteousness is fulfilled *in* us who walk after the Spirit).

-   **The Final Test: A People Identified by the Law**
    -   Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus."
    -   This is the identifying mark of God's remnant people in the final crisis.
    -   [RQ]: According to Revelation 14:12, why is keeping the commandments linked so closely with having the faith *of* Jesus, not just faith *in* Jesus?
    -   The "faith of Jesus" is a saving faith that produces obedience. It is the very faith He lived by.
    -   [EB]: James 2:10-12 (The law is a unified whole, and it is the "law of liberty" by which we will be judged, connecting it to the Investigative Judgment).
    -   [EB]: Deuteronomy 6:5-9 (The law was always intended to be a part of life and education, written on the heart and mind).

### **Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)**

-   Summary: The law is not an abolished relic. It is a perfect transcript of God's character, the foundation of His government, magnified by Christ, and the sign of His end-time people.
-   Satan’s lie is that the law is a burden. God’s truth is that it is the framework for liberty and love.
-   The critical question is not "Can I keep the law?" but "Will I allow Christ to live out His law-abiding life in me?" (Gal 2:20).
-   This is the essence of True Education: unlearning our selfish ways and learning His ways, allowing His Spirit to write His principles on our hearts.
-   Appeal: Surrender your heart to Christ today. Invite Him to fulfill His new covenant promise in you—to replace your resistance with a love for His law and to restore His perfect character in you, preparing you for His soon return. (John 14:15).
