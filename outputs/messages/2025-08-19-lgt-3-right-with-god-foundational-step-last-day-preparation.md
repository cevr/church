### **Introduction (5 min) - The Universal Problem & Divine Solution**
-   The starting point of all humanity: Romans 3:23 – "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
    -   [WB]: ALL HAVE SINNED (Rom 3:23) -> SEPARATION (Isa 59:2)
    -   [RQ]: What does it mean to "come short of the glory of God"? (Reflects loss of His character/image, Gen 1:27).
-   The great question of the ages: How can a sinful man be right with a holy God? (Job 9:2)
-   Human attempts fail: Trying to bridge the gap with our own works (legalism).
    -   [Aside]: It's like trying to pay a billion-dollar debt with a handful of pennies. Our best efforts are utterly insufficient and tainted by sin (Isa 64:6).
-   God's divine answer is not a process we follow, but a Person we receive: Jesus Christ.
-   This study lays the foundation: Justification by Faith. It is the legal groundwork for the entire educational process of restoring God's image in us.

### **Main Content 1 (12 min) - God's Righteousness: A Gift Received (Romans 3)**
-   **The Need:** The Law reveals our sinfulness, it cannot remove it.
    -   Romans 3:20 - "...by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin."
    -   [WB]: Law = Mirror. It shows the dirt; it cannot wash it away.
    -   [EB]: James 2:10 (To break one point of the law is to be guilty of all).
-   **The Biblical Principle:** A new righteousness is revealed.
    -   Romans 3:21-22 - "But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested... even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe."
    -   [RQ]: If this righteousness is "without the law," where does it come from? (v. 22 - It is God's own righteousness, received through faith).
    -   [EGW]: "What is justification by faith? It is the work of God in laying the glory of man in the dust, and doing for man that which it is not in his power to do for himself." (Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, 456.2)
-   **The Mechanism of Justification:**
    -   Romans 3:24-26 - A free gift, through redemption, by His blood.
    -   **Freely by His Grace (v. 24):** Unearned, undeserved.
    -   **Through Redemption (v. 24):** A price was paid to buy us back.
        -   [EB]: 1 Peter 1:18-19 (Redeemed not with silver/gold, but with the precious blood of Christ).
    -   **Propitiation (v. 25):** His sacrifice satisfies the justice of God's law.
    -   [WB]: Justification = God declares the believing sinner "Not Guilty" + Credits Christ's perfect record to their account.
-   **Actionable Step (Unlearning):**
    -   Based on Rom 3:20, we must *unlearn* the tendency to measure our standing with God by our performance. Our standing is based solely on Christ's performance.

### **Main Content 2 (12 min) - The Personal Reality: A Life Exchanged [*] (Galatians 2)**
-   **The Need:** Moving from intellectual assent to personal reality.
    -   Galatians 2:16 - "...a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ..."
    -   Paul repeats this three times for emphasis. The early church struggled with this; so do we.
    -   [EB]: Acts 15:1, 5 (The Jerusalem council addressed the error of mixing works/circumcision with salvation).
-   **The Biblical Principle:** Identification with Christ's death and resurrection.
    -   Galatians 2:20 - "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me..."
    -   [WB]: Draw: OLD SELF (nailed to cross) -> NEW LIFE (Christ living within).
    -   [RQ]: What does it mean practically to be "crucified with Christ"? (It's a daily surrender of self, our will, our plans). This is the death that precedes restoration.
-   **The Fuel for the New Life:**
    -   Galatians 2:20b - "...and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
    -   It's not just faith *in* Christ, but the very faith *of* Christ working in us.
-   **Bridging to Practice (Learning):**
    -   The Christian life is not "try harder," but "trust deeper."
    -   [Aside]: Imagine trying to power a modern home with candles. It's exhausting and ineffective. When you connect to the power grid, the power is external, immense, and flows through the house. Christ living in us is connecting to the divine power source.
    -   **Actionable Step:** Begin each day with the prayer of Galatians 2:20 - surrendering the "I" and asking Christ to live His life through you. This is a core lesson in the curriculum of True Education.

### **Main Content 3 (10 min) - The Practical Result: A Life Transformed (Ephesians 2)**
-   **The Principle Restated:** The simple Gospel equation.
    -   Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
    -   [WB]: GRACE (Source) + FAITH (Channel) = SALVATION (Gift). Not of WORKS (Result).
    -   [RQ]: Why does Paul stress "lest any man should boast"? (To ensure all glory goes to God; self-righteousness is the opposite of restoration).
-   **The Purpose of Salvation:** Justification is the gateway, not the destination.
    -   Ephesians 2:10 - "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
    -   [EB]: 2 Corinthians 5:17 (Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature...).
-   **Bridging to Character Restoration:**
    -   Justification is our legal title to heaven. Sanctification (the "good works") is our fitness for heaven.
    -   God doesn't just pardon us; He begins a process of *re-creation* ("workmanship"). This is the restoration of His image.
    -   These "good works" are not legalistic drudgery, but the natural fruit of a heart changed by grace (cf. Matt 7:17-18).
-   **Actionable Step (Application):**
    -   View your daily duties, acts of service, and obedience not as ways to *earn* salvation, but as opportunities to *walk in* the purpose for which you were saved. It is practical training in the school of Christ.

### **Conclusion & Appeal (6 min) - The Only Foundation for Sanctification**
-   **Summary of Truth:**
    -   The Law diagnoses the problem of sin (Rom 3:20).
    -   The Gospel provides the solution: Justification by faith in Christ's righteousness (Rom 3:24).
    -   This is a personal reality where we die to self and Christ lives in us (Gal 2:20).
    -   This new life inevitably produces the fruit of good works, fulfilling God's purpose of restoration (Eph 2:10).
-   **Connection to Last Days:**
    -   Any attempt at character perfection or overcoming sin for the last days that does not begin with a clear understanding and acceptance of justification is **doomed to become legalism.**
    -   The Investigative Judgment does not re-evaluate Christ's sacrifice; it examines the genuineness of the faith of those who claim it. True faith works (Gal 5:6).
    -   [RQ]: Can a house be built without a foundation? Can a Christ-like character be formed without first being made right with God through Christ?
-   **The Appeal:**
    -   Have you ceased from your own works and rested entirely on the finished work of Jesus Christ?
    -   Today, accept the verdict of "Not Guilty" that heaven offers. Let this be the foundation upon which the Holy Spirit can begin the glorious educational work of restoring the Father's image in you, preparing you for His soon return.
