### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Common view: Eternal conscious torment. Source? Tradition vs. Scripture.
- Our goal: Examine what the Bible *actually* says about the final fate of the wicked.
- Importance: Understanding God's true character â€“ Justice and Love.
- Central Question: Does God preserve wickedness eternally, or eradicate it?
- Introduce Central Verse: Malachi 4:1 - Sets the stage for destruction.

### Main Content Section 1: The Biblical Language of Destruction (10 min)
- **Point 1: Clear Scriptural Terms for Finality**
    - Malachi 4:1 - "burn them up," "leave them neither root nor branch."
        - [RQ]: What does "neither root nor branch" imply about existence? (Mal 4:1)
    - Malachi 4:3 - Wicked shall be "ashes under the soles of your feet."
        - [WB]: Fire -> Stubble -> Ashes (Mal 4:1, 3) = Complete Consumption
    - Matthew 10:28 - Fear Him who can "destroy both soul and body in hell (Gehenna)."
        - [RQ]: What does the word "destroy" (Gk: *apollumi*) typically mean? (Matt 10:28)
        - [WB]: Destroy (Gk: *apollumi*) = Ruin, Render Useless, Kill, Perish (Strong's G622)
    - John 3:16 - The contrast: "everlasting life" vs. "perish."
        - [RQ]: If the righteous receive *life*, what is the logical opposite for those who "perish"? (John 3:16)
        - [EGW]: "How repugnant to every emotion of love and mercy, and even to our sense of justice, is the doctrine that the wicked dead are tormented with fire and brimstone in an eternally burning hell; that for the sins of a brief earthly life they are to suffer torture as long as God shall live." (GC 535.1)
        - [EB]: 2 Thessalonians 1:9 (Everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord)
- **Point 2: The Fate of Satan Himself**
    - Ezekiel 28:18-19 - Prophecy concerning the covering cherub (Satan).
        - "I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth..." (v. 18)
        - "...never shalt thou be any more." (v. 19)
        - [RQ]: If the originator of sin is ultimately turned to ashes and ceases to be, what does this suggest about the fate of sin and unrepentant sinners? (Ezek 28:18-19)
        - [EB]: Isaiah 14:12-20 (Lucifer's fall and ultimate end described)

### Main Content Section 2: Unpacking Difficult Texts & God's Character [*] (12 min)
- **Point 1: Understanding "Forever" and "Everlasting"**
    - Context is key. Does "forever" always mean endless duration?
    - 1 Samuel 1:22, 28 - Hannah lends Samuel to the Lord "for ever." Meaning: As long as he lives.
    - Jude 7 - Sodom & Gomorrah suffer vengeance of "eternal fire."
        - [RQ]: Are Sodom and Gomorrah still burning today? What does "eternal" signify here? (Jude 7) (Answer: Eternal consequences/results, not process).
        - [WB]: Eternal Fire (Jude 7) = Fire with *Eternal Results* (Destruction)
    - Matthew 25:41 - "Everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels."
        - The *source* (God's presence) and *results* (destruction) are everlasting, not necessarily the conscious suffering in the flames.
        - [EB]: Isaiah 33:14-15 (Who can dwell with everlasting burnings? The righteous.)
- **Point 2: The "Smoke of Their Torment"**
    - Revelation 14:9-11 - Worshipers of the beast tormented "with fire and brimstone." Smoke ascends "for ever and ever."
        - [RQ]: Does smoke ascending mean the *source* (the tormented person) is eternally preserved? (Rev 14:11)
    - Psalm 37:20 - "the wicked shall perish... into smoke shall they consume away."
        - Smoke signifies *complete consumption* and judgment executed.
        - [WB]: Smoke (Ps 37:20) = Evidence of Complete Consumption
    - [EGW]: 'But the infliction of retributive justice upon the wicked is utterly abhorrent to God's character... It is His strange act... God's love is represented in Scripture as the reason why He will destroy sin.' (Manuscript Releases, vol. 12, p. 209 / Reflecting Christ p. 366 - Paraphrased concept, check exact quote/ref if needed for presentation)
    - [Aside]: Think of a large fire consuming a building. The smoke lingers long after the structure is gone, signifying the totality of the destruction. The smoke is the *evidence* of the past event.
- **Point 3: God's Consuming Presence**
    - Hebrews 12:29 - "For our God is a consuming fire."
    - Isaiah 33:14-16 - Sinners fear, but the righteous can dwell with this fire.
        - [RQ]: How can God's presence be life to the righteous but destruction to the wicked? (Isa 33:14-16; Heb 12:29) (Answer: Depends on character - alignment or opposition to God's nature).

### Main Content Section 3: The Great Controversy Resolved & God's Restoration (12 min)
- **Point 1: The Second Death - Final Eradication**
    - Revelation 20:9 - Fire comes down from God out of heaven and "devoured them."
    - Revelation 20:14 - "And death and hell (hades - the grave) were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death."
        - [RQ]: What does it mean for "death" itself to be destroyed? (Rev 20:14) (Answer: Its power and existence end).
        - [WB]: Lake of Fire = Second Death = Final End of Sin/Sinners/Death (Rev 20:14)
    - [EB]: Revelation 2:11 (He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.)
- **Point 2: God's Thoroughness - No More Affliction**
    - Nahum 1:9 - "affliction shall not rise up the second time."
    - Obadiah 1:16 - "...they shall be as though they had not been."
        - [RQ]: How does the idea of eternal torment contradict the promise that affliction (sin and its results) will not rise again? (Nahum 1:9)
        - [EGW]: 'The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love.' (GC 678.2)
- **Point 3: God's Ultimate Plan - Restoration**
    - Acts 3:21 - "...the times of restitution of all things..."
        - [RQ]: Was eternal torment part of God's original creation? How does destroying sin fit the "restitution of all things"? (Acts 3:21; Gen 1-2)
    - Revelation 21:1, 4 - "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
        - [WB]: New Earth (Rev 21:1, 4): NO Death, NO Sorrow, NO Crying, NO Pain = NO Eternal Hell.
        - [Aside]: Imagine the peace of heaven. Could perfect peace exist for the redeemed if they knew loved ones (or anyone) were suffering eternally? God's plan brings *complete* resolution and peace.
        - [EB]: 2 Peter 3:10-13 (Elements melt, new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness)
- **Point 4: Practical Implication - Trusting God's Justice**
    - Understanding God's true character removes fear based on misconceptions.
    - It's part of our 'True Education': Unlearning human/satanic distortions of God, learning His true nature from His Word.
    - This builds trust and motivates loving obedience, not fearful compliance.
    - Focus shifts from avoiding torture to embracing restoration and relationship.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
- Recap: The Bible consistently uses language of destruction, consumption, and cessation of being for the wicked (Mal 4:1, Matt 10:28, Rev 20:14).
- Difficult texts ("forever," "smoke") are clarified by context and other scriptures (Ps 37:20, Jude 7).
- God's character: Just, loving, ultimately restorative. He hates sin, not the sinner, but unrepentant sin must be eradicated for universal peace (Nahum 1:9, Rev 21:4).
- The Great Controversy ends with a clean universe, not an eternal dualism of heaven and hellfire (GC 678).
- Invitation:
    - Choose life (John 3:16). Embrace God's offer of salvation and restoration through Jesus Christ.
    - Study His Word to understand His true character, unlearning errors.
    - Allow Him to educate and transform your character for the restored kingdom where righteousness dwells (2 Pet 3:13).
- Final Prayer.
