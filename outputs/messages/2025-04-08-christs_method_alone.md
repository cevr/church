### Introduction (5 min)

- The Challenge: Reaching a world needing connection, not just information.
- The Divine Blueprint: Christ's method alone brings true success (Concept from
  Ministry of Healing, p. 143).
- Focus: Examining the biblical basis of this method – How did Jesus _actually_
  do it?
- Central Verse Exploration: Matthew 9:35-36
  - Jesus _went about_ - He was present.
  - Teaching, Preaching, Healing - Holistic ministry.
  - Motivation: Compassion for the shepherdless.
    `[Write on board: Compassion (Matt 9:36)]`
- Roadmap: We will trace this method through Scripture: Mingling -> Winning
  Confidence -> Bidding to Follow.

### Section 1: Mingling with Compassion (12 min)

- **What is Mingling?**
  - Intentional presence among people where they are. (Matt 9:35)
  - Driven by genuine compassion, seeing needs. (Matt 9:36)
  - Breaking down social/cultural barriers.
- **Biblical Example 1: Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10)**
  - Jesus entering Jericho, passing through. (v. 1)
  - Seeking out the 'unreachable' - the chief publican. (v. 2-5)
  - Jesus initiates: "Zacchaeus, make haste... today I must abide at thy house."
    (v. 5) `[Write on board: Jesus Initiates (Luke 19:5)]`
  - Result: Joy, transformation, salvation. (v. 6-10)
  - (RQ) How does Jesus' approach here challenge our comfort zones? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Example 2: Woman at the Well (John 4:7-15 - Initial Contact)**
  - Jesus intentionally goes through Samaria. (v. 4)
  - Crosses cultural/religious divides to speak to her. (v. 7, 9)
  - Starts with a common, felt need (water/thirst). (v. 7)
    `[Write on board: Felt Need -> Spiritual Need (John 4)]`
  - (RQ) Are we willing to 'go out of our way' like Jesus did? **(RQ)**
- **Illustration: Building the Bridge**
  - Think of building trust like building a bridge. You wouldn't try to drive
    heavy trucks (the deep truths of the Gospel) over a flimsy, half-built
    structure. Mingling and showing genuine interest (Matt 9:35-36) is like
    laying the strong foundation and building the supports first, preparing the
    way for deeper connection.
- **Practical Mingling Today:**
  - Being present in community (neighbors, work, school).
  - Listening more than speaking initially.
  - Looking for needs with eyes of compassion (inspired by Matt 9:36).

### Section 2: Winning Confidence Through Service (12 min) [*]

- **What is Winning Confidence?**
  - Showing genuine sympathy and care.
  - Ministering to needs (physical, emotional, social).
  - Building trust through selfless action.
- **Biblical Foundation: Jesus' Example (Acts 10:38)**
  - "God anointed Jesus... who went about doing good, and healing..."
    `[Write on board: Doing Good (Acts 10:38)]`
  - His actions validated His words and showed God's character.
- **Biblical Example: Woman at the Well (John 4:16-26 - Deeper Connection)**
  - Jesus gently addresses her deeper life issues (sin). (v. 16-18)
  - He demonstrates supernatural knowledge, building credibility. (v. 19)
  - He shifts to spiritual truth (worship) _after_ establishing connection. (v.
    20-24)
  - Reveals Himself as Messiah _after_ trust is built. (v. 25-26)
- **The Mindset: Christ's Humility (Philippians 2:5-8)**
  - Emptied Himself, took servant form. (v. 7)
    `[Write on board: Servant Mindset (Phil 2:5-8)]`
  - True service requires humility, putting others first.
  - (RQ) Does our service point people to us, or to Christ? **(RQ)**
- **Illustration: Preparing the Soil**
  - Service that wins confidence (Acts 10:38) is like preparing soil before
    planting. You remove the rocks (prejudices, distrust) and weeds
    (indifference) through acts of kindness and meeting needs, making the heart
    receptive to the seed of God's Word. Selfless service softens the ground.
- **Practical Service Today:**
  - Identifying and meeting tangible needs (food, help, listening ear).
  - Consistent kindness and integrity.
  - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]`
  - Earning the right to be heard through genuine care.

### Section 3: Bidding Them to Follow (10 min)

- **The Goal: Discipleship**
  - Mingling and service open the door; the invitation is crucial.
  - Not just belief, but following Jesus.
- **Biblical Example 1: Calling the First Disciples (Mark 1:16-20)**
  - Jesus finds them in their daily lives (by the sea). (v. 16)
  - The clear call: "Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of
    men." (v. 17) `[Write on board: Follow Me -> Become... (Mark 1:17)]`
  - Requires a response: Leaving nets, following Him. (v. 18, 20)
- **Biblical Example 2: Calling Matthew (Matthew 9:9)**
  - Jesus sees Matthew at the tax booth (mingling).
  - Simple, direct command: "Follow me." (v. 9)
  - Immediate response: "And he arose, and followed him." (v. 9)
- **The Nature of the Call:**
  - An invitation to a relationship with Christ.
  - A call to learn His ways and join His mission.
  - Timing is important – often comes _after_ confidence is won.
  - (RQ) Are we clear about the ultimate invitation when we connect with people?
    **(RQ)**
- **Practical Bidding Today:**
  - Inviting people to study the Bible.
  - Sharing personal testimony of following Jesus.
  - Inviting to church, small groups, fellowship.
  - Clearly presenting the Gospel call to repentance and faith.
  - `[Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use opportunities... to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love... like finding a coin... we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Interactions offer open doors for sharing truth.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap: The Divine Sequence**
  - Mingling with Compassion (Matt 9:35-36)
  - Winning Confidence through Service (Acts 10:38, Phil 2:5-8)
  - Bidding Them to Follow Him (Mark 1:17)
  - This isn't just _a_ method, it's _Christ's_ method, rooted in His character
    and example.
- **The Simplicity:** It starts with genuine care and presence, flows into
  service, and culminates in invitation.
  `[Write on board: Care -> Service -> Invitation]`
- **Personal Reflection:**
  - Where can I intentionally mingle this week? **(RQ)**
  - What act of service can I offer to build trust? **(RQ)**
  - Am I ready to gently invite someone closer to Jesus? **(RQ)**
- **Call to Action:**
  - Pray for God to give you His compassion (Matt 9:36).
  - Take one small step this week to practice one aspect of Christ's method.
  - Trust that as you follow His method, He will give the increase.
- **Final Encouragement:** Emulating Christ's method is how we participate in
  His mission of seeking and saving the lost (Luke 19:10).
