### Introduction (5 min)
*   Welcome & Prayer
*   Introduce the concept: Earthly marriage, ordained by God, is a profound illustration of a higher reality – Christ's relationship with His church and the individual believer's journey of sanctification.
*   Central Verse: Ephesians 5:31-32 - The 'great mystery' connects human marriage directly to Christ and the Church.
*   Goal: To explore how the principles of a godly marriage illuminate the process of being made holy (sanctified) and restored into God's image.
*   [RQ]: How often do we consider our relationship with Christ in terms of a marriage covenant? What does that imply?

### Main Content 1: God's Design - Leaving, Cleaving, Oneness (10 min)
*   **Foundation:** Genesis 2:24 - God's original blueprint for marriage.
    *   **Leave:** Forsaking former primary allegiances.
        *   Spiritual Parallel: Leaving the 'world' and the 'old self' (Rom 6:6, Eph 4:22).
        *   [WB]: Diagram: World/Self <--- (Leave) ---> Christ
    *   **Cleave:** Commitment, sticking fast, loyalty.
        *   Spiritual Parallel: Unwavering commitment to Christ (John 15:4-5, Deut 10:20).
        *   [RQ]: What does 'cleaving' to Christ look like practically in a world pulling us away? (Gen 2:24)
    *   **One Flesh:** Deep unity, shared life, purpose, intimacy.
        *   Spiritual Parallel: Becoming 'one spirit' with the Lord (1 Cor 6:17), sharing His mind and purpose (Phil 2:5).
        *   [EB]: Song of Solomon (Illustrates the intimacy and devotion in the divine-human relationship).
*   This divine pattern sets the stage for understanding Christ's relationship with us.

### Main Content 2: The Bridegroom's Love - Sanctification [*] (12 min)
*   **The Husband's Role Model:** Ephesians 5:25-27 - Christ's love for the church.
    *   **Love as Sacrifice:** "Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it" (v. 25).
        *   Parallels: Commitment, Sacrifice in marriage.
        *   [Aside]: Just as a spouse might sacrifice personal desires for the good of the marriage, Christ made the ultimate sacrifice. This sacrificial love is the foundation of our restoration.
        *   [RQ]: How does meditating on Christ's sacrifice motivate our own 'sacrifices' in the sanctification process (e.g., giving up sin)? (Eph 5:25)
    *   **Love as Sanctification:** "That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word" (v. 26).
        *   This is the educational aspect: The Word cleanses, corrects, instructs, transforms.
        *   [WB]: Christ's Love -> Sacrifice (v.25) -> Sanctify/Cleanse (v.26) -> Glorious Church (v.27)
        *   [EGW]: 'The union of Christ with His church is shadowed forth in the marriage relation... As the bridegroom seeks to efface every spot and wrinkle from the person of his chosen, so Christ seeks to purify His church...' (Signs of the Times, Oct 21, 1897).
        *   [EB]: John 17:17 ("Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.")
    *   **Love's Goal:** "That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish" (v. 27).
        *   The goal is complete restoration, character perfection, readiness for eternity.
        *   Connects to the final generation needing to reflect Christ fully (Rev 14:1-5).

### Main Content 3: The Bride's Preparation - Fidelity & Readiness (12 min)
*   **The Bride's Response:** Reflecting the qualities of a godly spouse towards Christ.
    *   **Fidelity & Purity:** 2 Corinthians 11:2 - Paul's desire to present the church as a 'chaste virgin' to Christ.
        *   Requires guarding the heart and mind (Prov 4:23).
        *   Involves 'unlearning' worldly affections and 'learning' heavenly ones.
        *   [RQ]: What compromises our spiritual 'chastity' or fidelity to Christ today? (2 Cor 11:2)
        *   [EB]: James 4:4 (Friendship with the world is enmity with God - spiritual adultery).
    *   **Covenant Faithfulness:** Hosea 2:19-20 - God 'betroths' His people in righteousness, judgment, lovingkindness, mercies, and faithfulness.
        *   These are qualities God imparts AND expects in return.
        *   Understanding God comes through this relationship: "thou shalt know the Lord."
        *   [WB]: Betrothal Qualities (Hos 2:19-20): Righteousness, Judgment, Lovingkindness, Mercies, Faithfulness = Character Restoration.
    *   **Communication & Understanding:** Essential for any relationship, especially the divine.
        *   User's 5 Methods: Prayer, Nature, Bible, Providence, History - avenues to 'know the Lord' (Hos 2:20).
        *   [Aside]: Just as spouses need open communication for understanding and trust, we need constant communion with God through His Word and prayer to understand His will and build loving trust (fidelity).
        *   [EB]: Jeremiah 29:13 ("And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.")
    *   **Readiness & Preparation:** Revelation 19:7-9 - "the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready."
        *   Readiness = Character transformation ("fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints" v. 8).
        *   This is the culmination of the sanctification (restoration/education) process.
        *   Urgency: The Bridegroom is coming soon (Matt 25:1-13).
        *   [EGW]: 'We are nearing the close of this earth's history... Are we preparing to act our part in the scenes that are just before us? ... Are our lamps trimmed and burning?' (Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 98.2)
        *   [EB]: Matthew 22:1-14 (Parable of the Wedding Garment - necessity of imparted righteousness).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
*   Recap: Marriage is God's chosen symbol for the deep, committed, transforming relationship He desires with us.
*   It illustrates the process of sanctification: Christ's sacrificial love initiating cleansing (Eph 5:25-26), and our response of fidelity, learning, and preparation (2 Cor 11:2, Rev 19:7-8).
*   This is the 'True Education' – unlearning sin, learning righteousness, being restored to His image.
*   [RQ]: Seeing our relationship with Christ through the lens of marriage, what aspect needs more commitment or attention in our lives?
*   Appeal: Let us embrace this divine romance. Let us respond to the Bridegroom's love with wholehearted devotion, allowing His Word to wash us, preparing ourselves through His grace to be ready for the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
