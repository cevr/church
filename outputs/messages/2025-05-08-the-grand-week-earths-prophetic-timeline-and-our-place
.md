### Introduction (5 min)
-   The human fascination with time and God's eternal perspective.
-   Scripture reveals patterns that illuminate God's plan.
-   Introducing the concept of a "Grand Week" for earth's history – an idea explored by Bible students.
    -   [RQ]: Has God given us clues about the general timeframe of His work on earth?

### Main Content Section 1: God's Time and Prophetic Patterns (10 min)
-   **God's Measurement of Time:**
    -   2 Peter 3:8 - "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."
        -   [WB]: 2 Peter 3:8 --> 1 Divine "Day" = 1000 Human Years
        -   [RQ]: How does this verse shift our understanding of God's patience and long-range plans? (2 Pet 3:9)
    -   Psalm 90:4 - "For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night."
        -   This isn't about precise calculation for setting dates, but understanding God's grand scale.
    -   [EB]: Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6 (Day-for-a-year principle in specific prophecies – establishes precedent for symbolic time).

-   **The Principle of Divine Patterns:**
    -   God often uses patterns and types in Scripture (e.g., Sanctuary services, feasts).
    -   [Aside]: Think of a blueprint. God, the Master Architect, often uses recurring designs in His vast construction of salvation history. This helps us understand the bigger picture.

### Main Content Section 2: The Creation Week Model [*] (10 min)
-   **The Original Week – A Divine Blueprint:**
    -   Genesis 1:1-2:3 - The literal seven-day creation.
        -   Six days of work, forming and filling.
        -   Genesis 2:1-3 - The seventh day sanctified and blessed as a day of rest.
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Creation Week: 6 Days Work + 1 Day Rest (Sabbath)
    -   [RQ]: Why did God establish a weekly cycle ending in rest? What might this foreshadow? (Heb 4:4)

-   **Earth's History as a "Great Week":**
    -   The idea: 6 "days" (6000 years) of human toil and sin, followed by a 1 "day" (1000-year) "Sabbath" rest.
    -   [EGW]: "The great controversy between Christ and Satan, that has been carried forward for nearly six thousand years, is soon to close; and the wicked one redoubles his efforts to defeat the work of Christ in man's behalf and to fasten souls in his snares." (GC 518.1)
        -   This suggests a general timeframe understood by pioneers.
    -   [EB]: Hosea 6:1-2 ("After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up...") - Some see millennial/resurrection patterns, though interpretations vary. This is more illustrative of pattern-thinking.

### Main Content Section 3: The Millennial Sabbath Rest (12 min)
-   **The 6000 Years of Toil and the Great Controversy:**
    -   Human history since the Fall: characterized by sin, suffering, and Satan's rebellion.
    -   Romans 8:22 - "For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now."
    -   [RQ]: If the "days" of creation work were followed by rest, what might follow the "6000 years" of earth's travail?

-   **The Thousand-Year "Sabbath" in Heaven:**
    -   Revelation 20:4-6 - Saints reign with Christ for a thousand years.
        -   [WB]: Earth's "Week": ~6000 yrs (Sin/Toil) --> Second Coming --> 1000 yrs (Heavenly Rest/Reign with Christ)
        -   This occurs *after* the Second Coming, for the redeemed in heaven.
        -   During this time, earth is desolate (Jer 4:23-27; Rev 20:1-3).
    -   Hebrews 4:9 - "There remaineth therefore a rest (Sabbatismos - a Sabbath-keeping) to the people of God."
        -   The weekly Sabbath points to this ultimate, eternal rest.
    -   [EB]: Isaiah 24:1-6, 21-22 (Earth desolate during a period, judgment on high ones/kings).

-   **The Purpose of the Millennium:**
    -   Rest for the saints, review of God's judgments (1 Cor 6:2-3).
    -   Vindication of God's character in the Great Controversy.
    -   [EGW]: "During the thousand years between the first and the second resurrection the judgment of the wicked takes place... In union with Christ they judge the wicked, comparing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case according to the deeds done in the body." (GC 660.3, 661.1)

### Main Content Section 4: Living in the "Evening" of Time (12 min)
-   **Recognizing the Signs – Approaching the "Sabbath":**
    -   Matthew 24:32-33 - "Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors."
    -   The "nearly six thousand years" understanding implies we are in the closing period of earth's history before Christ's return.
    -   [RQ]: If we are living in what appears to be the "Friday evening" of earth's history, how should this impact our priorities? (Luke 21:28, 34-36)
    -   [WB]: "Friday Evening" of Earth's History? --> Urgency: Preparation, Mission, Character.

-   **The Call to Readiness – True Education for Eternity:**
    -   2 Peter 3:10-14 - Exhortation to holy conduct and godliness in light of the coming day of the Lord.
    -   This is not about date-setting, but about character preparation.
    -   **Restoration of God's Image:** The primary work now is to cooperate with the Holy Spirit in having Christ's character formed in us (Gal 4:19; 2 Cor 3:18). This is True Education.
        -   Unlearning sin and error, learning truth and righteousness.
    -   [Aside]: Imagine preparing for a long-awaited, glorious Sabbath. We wouldn't leave preparations to the last minute. Spiritually, we are called to prepare our hearts now for the eternal rest.
    -   [EB]: Revelation 14:6-12 (The Three Angels' Messages – God's final call of mercy and warning, preparing a people).
    -   [EB]: Daniel 12:1-4 (Time of trouble, deliverance, resurrection, sealing, knowledge increased at time of end).

-   **Our Role in These Closing Moments:**
    -   Faithfulness in present duty (Matt 24:45-46).
    -   Proclaiming the everlasting gospel in the context of Christ's soon return.
    -   Living as citizens of the coming kingdom.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   The "Grand Week" concept, while not a rigid dogma, provides a powerful framework for understanding our place in prophetic time.
-   The overwhelming evidence points to the soon return of Jesus.
-   The most critical question: Are we ready for the great "Sabbath" rest?
    -   This readiness comes through faith in Christ and the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit – the True Education that restores God's image in us.
-   Invitation to commit to a life of watchfulness, prayer, and earnest preparation, looking forward to the eternal rest with Christ.
    -   Hebrews 4:11 - "Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief."
