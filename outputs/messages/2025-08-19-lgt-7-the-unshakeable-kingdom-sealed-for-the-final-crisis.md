### Introduction (5 min)
-   Overview of final events: not to inspire fear, but understanding and preparation.
-   God’s character is one of love and protection for His people. He reveals the end from the beginning (Isaiah 46:10).
-   The final crisis is a culmination of the Great Controversy.
-   [RQ]: If God has foretold these events, what must be His purpose for us in studying them? (Amos 3:7)
-   Our focus: God's process of securing His people *before* the final storm breaks. This is an educational process of becoming fit for heaven.
-   [WB]: Timeline: TODAY -> Sealing -> Close of Probation -> Time of Trouble -> Second Coming

### Main Content Section 1: The Seal of the Living God (12 min)
-   **What is the Sealing Work?**
    -   Revelation 7:1-3 - Angels hold back the winds of strife until God's people are sealed.
    -   [RQ]: What does this "holding back" imply about God's mercy and timing?
    -   The seal is not an outward mark, but a "settling into the truth, both intellectually and spiritually, so they cannot be moved."
    -   [EGW]: 'The seal of the living God is placed upon those who consciously keep the Sabbath of the Lord.' (SDA BC 7:970.6) - This connects to character and allegiance.
    -   [WB]: Two Columns: Seal of God vs. Mark of the Beast
        -   Seal: Forehead (Mind, Allegiance), God's Law (Sabbath), Worship Creator (Rev 14:7)
        -   Mark: Forehead/Hand (Mind/Actions), Man's Law, Worship Beast (Rev 14:9)
-   **The Character of the Sealed**
    -   Ephesians 4:30 - We are sealed by the Holy Spirit. This is a present-tense work.
    -   This sealing process is the restoration of God's image in the soul. It is the result of True Education.
    -   [Aside]: A king's seal on a document contained his name, title, and territory, validating its authority. God's seal (the Sabbath) contains His name (Creator), title (Lord), and territory (heaven and earth - Ex 20:8-11), authenticating His law and our allegiance to Him.
    -   [EB]: 2 Timothy 2:19 (The foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his.)
    -   Ezekiel 9:4 - The mark/seal is placed on those who "sigh and cry for all the abominations."
    -   [RQ]: What does this emotional response tell us about the character of the sealed? Are they in harmony with God's view of sin?
    -   This shows a complete separation from sin and a full alignment with God's will. This is the goal of our education.

### Main Content Section 2: The Unalterable Decree [*] (10 min)
-   **The Close of Probation**
    -   Revelation 22:11 - "He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... he that is righteous, let him be righteous still."
    -   This marks the end of Christ's mediatorial work in the heavenly sanctuary.
    -   [WB]: Draw Sanctuary -> Christ moves from Most Holy Place -> Probation Closes (Dan 8:14, Heb 9:24-28).
    -   [RQ]: What does it mean for a person's case to be decided for eternity? What does this imply about the importance of our choices today?
    -   [EB]: Genesis 6:3 ("My spirit shall not always strive with man...") - A principle seen throughout history.
    -   [EB]: Luke 13:24-25 (The master of the house has risen up and shut the door).
-   **The Separation Begins**
    -   Ezekiel 9:5-6 - After the sealing, the command is given to slay those without the mark.
    -   This is a type, a local illustration of a final, worldwide reality.
    -   The separation is based on the character developed during the time of probation.
    -   [EGW]: 'When the decree goes forth and the stamp is impressed, their character will remain pure and spotless for eternity.' (5T 216.1)
    -   This is the reality for the final generation: to stand in the sight of a holy God without a mediator, relying solely on the character formed through a life of faith and obedience.

### Main Content Section 3: Standing Through the Time of Trouble (12 min)
-   **The Great Test Begins**
    -   Daniel 12:1 - Michael stands up (probation closes), and then comes "a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation."
    -   [RQ]: Why would God allow His sealed, faithful people to go through such a severe trial? (1 Peter 1:7)
    -   This is not a time of purification from sin (that work is done), but of perfecting faith and vindicating God.
    -   [Aside]: Like gold tested in a furnace, the trial doesn't create the gold's quality, it reveals and proves it. The time of trouble reveals the character God has already sealed in His people.
    -   [EB]: Jeremiah 30:7 (The time of Jacob's trouble).
-   **The Source of Their Strength**
    -   They must stand by faith alone, feeling as though they are forsaken (like Christ on the cross).
    -   Their educational journey has taught them to trust God's character and promises, even when circumstances seem to deny them.
    -   [WB]: Foundation for Survival:
        -   1. Settled into Truth (Sealed)
        -   2. Character Reflects Christ (Righteous Still)
        -   3. Faith in God's Promises (Isa 43:2, Ps 91)
    -   [RQ]: How does unlearning reliance on feelings and learning to rely on "It is written" prepare us for this time? (Matt 4:4)
    -   [EB]: Job 13:15 ("Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.") - The ultimate expression of faith required.
-   **God’s Ultimate Deliverance**
    -   Daniel 12:1b - "...and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book."
    -   The trial is severe, but deliverance is certain.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   Recap the sequence: God mercifully holds back destruction for the **Sealing**—an educational work of character restoration. This culminates in the **Close of Probation**, an unchangeable verdict. What follows is the **Time of Trouble**, a final test of faith for those already sealed.
-   The critical question is not "Can I survive the time of trouble?" but "Am I participating in the sealing work today?"
-   This sealing is the process of unlearning self-reliance and worldly thinking, and learning absolute dependence on Christ. It's about letting His Spirit restore His image in us.
-   [RQ]: Are you allowing the Holy Spirit to seal you today? Are you consciously choosing to "sigh and cry" over sin in your life and in the world, and to align your character with His?
-   Appeal: Let us not grieve the Holy Spirit (Eph 4:30). Let us submit to His educational work of restoration now, so that when Michael stands up, our characters are settled in righteousness, sealed for eternity.
