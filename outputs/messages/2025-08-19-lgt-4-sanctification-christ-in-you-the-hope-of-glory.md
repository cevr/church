### Introduction: Justification vs. Sanctification (5 min)

-   Defining our terms: Justification and Sanctification.
    -   Justification: Our legal standing. Declared righteous. A one-time event upon accepting Christ. (Rom 5:1)
    -   Sanctification: Our actual condition. Made righteous. The work of a lifetime. (1 Thess 5:23)
    -   [WB]: Two Columns: **Justification** (Legal, Declared Righteous, For Us) vs. **Sanctification** (Moral, Made Righteous, In Us)
-   The central mystery revealed: Colossians 1:27.
    -   The "mystery" isn't complicated; it's Christ *IN* you. This is the engine of sanctification.
    -   [RQ]: What does "hope of glory" mean? Is it just a future event, or does it have present reality according to this verse?
-   [EB]: Genesis 1:26-27 (The "glory" is the restoration of the image of God in which we were created).

### Main Content 1: The Divine Method of Sanctification (12 min)

-   **Christ's Parable of Connection: The Vine and the Branches.**
    -   Read John 15:1-8.
    -   Jesus is the source, we are the conduits. (John 15:1, 5)
    -   The core command: "Abide in me." (John 15:4)
    -   [WB]: Simple Diagram: **VINE (Jesus)** --> **BRANCH (Believer)** --> **FRUIT (Character/Holiness)**
    -   [RQ]: What does it practically mean to "abide"? Is it a feeling or a conscious choice of dependence? (John 15:7, 10)
    -   The result of abiding: Much fruit. (John 15:5) This is not self-effort.
    -   The result of disconnection: "Ye can do nothing." (John 15:5b) Utter helplessness in sanctification without Christ.
-   **The Process of Pruning.**
    -   The Father's role as the "husbandman" or gardener. (John 15:1-2)
    -   Pruning (trials, conviction of sin) is not punishment, but preparation for greater fruitfulness.
    -   [Aside]: A skilled gardener cuts a vine back severely, not to harm it, but because they know its potential. The cuts look harsh, but they are essential for a healthy harvest. God's pruning in our lives serves the same loving, restorative purpose.
    -   [EB]: Hebrews 12:11 (Chastening yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness).

### Main Content 2: God's Will and Our Transformation [*] (12 min)

-   **The Express Will of God.**
    -   1 Thessalonians 4:3 - "For this is the will of God, even your sanctification..."
    -   This is not a suggestion or a lofty ideal; it is the central purpose of God's plan for us after justification.
    -   [RQ]: If this is God's will, why is the process often a struggle? (ref. Gal 5:17 - flesh vs. Spirit).
    -   [EGW]: "Sanctification is not the work of a moment, an hour, a day, but of a lifetime. It is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the result of constantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ." (AA 560.2)
-   **The Educational Process of Transformation.**
    -   2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with open face beholding... are changed into the same image..."
    -   How does this change happen? By "beholding."
    -   [WB]: Beholding Christ (in Word/Prayer) --> Changed into His Image (Character Restoration).
    -   This is "True Education": unlearning the world's ways by focusing our minds on Christ's character and truth.
    -   [RQ]: What are we "beholding" daily? Social media? The news? How does that shape our image vs. beholding Christ?
    -   [EB]: Romans 12:2 (Be not conformed, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind).

### Main Content 3: The Urgent Necessity of Holiness (10 min)

-   **A Non-Negotiable Requirement.**
    -   Hebrews 12:14 - "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord."
    -   This is not about earning salvation, but the necessary character fitness for heaven.
    -   [RQ]: How does this verse square with salvation by grace alone? (ref. Eph 2:8-10 - we are saved *unto* good works).
    -   [Aside]: An astronaut must train and wear a special suit to survive in space. It doesn't earn them the trip, but it's the necessary preparation to exist in that new environment. Holiness is the atmosphere of heaven.
-   **The Final Generation Context.**
    -   This call to holiness has special significance for those living in the time of the end.
    -   The work of the Investigative Judgment in the heavenly sanctuary calls for a corresponding work of purification and character perfection in God's people on earth.
    -   [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (The cleansing of the Sanctuary is linked to a people being cleansed and sealed).
    -   [EB]: Revelation 14:12 - "Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus." This describes the fruit of sanctification in the last generation.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Recap: The Source and Goal.**
    -   The *method* is not trying harder, but abiding deeper. (John 15:4)
    -   The *power* is not our own, but "Christ in you." (Col 1:27)
    -   The *goal* is the restoration of God's image in us, a character fit for eternity. (2 Cor 3:18)
    -   The *urgency* is that without this completed work, we cannot stand in His presence. (Heb 12:14)
-   **The Educational Choice.**
    -   Sanctification is a daily choice to submit to God's educational process.
    -   It is a choice to disconnect from the world's influence and abide in Christ, the True Vine.
    -   [WB]: Our Choice: **Abide & Bear Fruit** OR **Disconnect & Wither** (John 15:5-6).
-   **Appeal.**
    -   [RQ]: Is your Christian life one of frustrating self-effort or restful abiding?
    -   The invitation is to stop striving and start surrendering. To let the Vine do the work through the branch.
    -   Let us pray for a deeper experience of "Christ in you," the only power that sanctifies, the only true "hope of glory."
