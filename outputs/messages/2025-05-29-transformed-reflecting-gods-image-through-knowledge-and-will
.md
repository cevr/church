## Introduction (5 min)

- The ultimate goal: Transformation into Christ's image (2 Cor 3:18).
  - This is salvation: restoration of God's image.
- Two essential components for this divine "re-education" and restoration:
  - Divine Knowledge: Understanding God and His standard.
  - Human Will: Cooperating with God's transforming power.
- [RQ]: What does it truly mean to be "transformed," and why is it so central to
  our faith? (Rom 12:2)
- [WB]: Title: Transformed! (2 Cor 3:18) | Knowledge + Will = Restoration

## Main Content Section 1: The Divine Blueprint & The Need for Restoration (10 min)

- **God's Original Design: Made in His Image**
  - Genesis 1:26-27 – "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness."
  - [WB]: Diagram: God -> Image (Gen 1:26) = Original Perfection (Physical,
    Mental, Spiritual)
  - [RQ]: What aspects of God's character do you think were reflected in Adam
    and Eve before sin? (Gen 1:27)
- **The Marring of the Image: Sin's Impact**
  - Romans 3:23 – "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
  - **Understanding God's Glory as His Character:**
    - Exodus 33:18-19 – Moses asked to see God's glory; God showed His character
      (goodness, mercy, gracious).
    - Exodus 34:6-7 – "The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious,
      longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, Keeping mercy for
      thousands, forgiving iniquity..."
    - John 1:14 – "And the Word was made flesh...full of grace and truth" -
      Christ revealed the Father's glory/character.
    - [WB]: God's Glory = His Character (Ex 34:6-7) = Mercy, Grace, Truth,
      Justice, Love
  - **How We Give God Glory:**
    - 1 Corinthians 10:31 – "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever
      ye do, do all to the glory of God."
    - Matthew 5:16 – "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
      good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
    - We give God glory by reflecting His character in our lives.
  - [EB]: Genesis 3:1-7 (The Fall – distortion of knowledge, misuse of will)
  - Sin introduced ignorance, selfishness, and a will bent away from God.
  - This necessitates a process of restoration and re-education.
- **The Promise of Restoration**
  - 2 Corinthians 5:17 – "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new
    creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
  - This new creation is a restoration of the original design.

## Main Content Section 2: Knowledge – The Foundation of Transformation [*] (15 min)

- **The Critical Role of Knowledge**

  - Hosea 4:6 – "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge..."
  - **Wisdom as the Principal Thing:**
    - Proverbs 4:7 – "Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and
      with all thy getting get understanding."
    - Proverbs 9:10 – "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
      knowledge of the holy is understanding."
    - [WB]: Wisdom = Principal Thing (Prov 4:7) | Fear of LORD = Beginning (Prov
      9:10)
  - [RQ]: If lack of knowledge leads to destruction, what does the pursuit of
    true knowledge lead to? (John 17:3)
  - [EGW]: "True education means more than the pursual of a certain course of
    study. It means more than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to
    do with the whole being, and with the whole period of existence possible to
    man. It is the harmonious development of the physical, the mental, and the
    spiritual powers." (Ed 13.1)
  - [EB]: Proverbs 2:6 (For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh
    knowledge and understanding.)

- **A. Knowledge of God: The Standard for Restoration**

  - John 17:3 – "And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
    true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent."
  - **Christ as the Wisdom of God:**
    - 1 Corinthians 1:24 – "But unto them which are called, both Jews and
      Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God."
    - Colossians 2:3 – "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and
      knowledge."
  - To be restored to His image, we must know what that image is.
    - His character: love, justice, mercy, purity (Exodus 34:6-7).
    - His ways: how He acts, speaks, thinks (Isaiah 55:8-9).
  - [WB]: KNOWLEDGE OF GOD (John 17:3) -> Character, Ways, Law (Ps 119:104)
  - [RQ]: How does studying Christ's life provide the clearest knowledge of
    God's character? (Heb 1:3)
  - [EB]: Daniel 9:22 (And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O
    Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.) – Divine
    aid in gaining knowledge.

- **B. Christ's Knowledge: The Perfect Example of Justification and
  Restoration**

  - **Isaiah 53:11** – "By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
    many; for he shall bear their iniquities."
    - Christ's perfect knowledge of the Father enabled Him to justify (make
      righteous) many.
    - His knowledge was not merely intellectual, but experiential and practical.
  - **Christ's Teaching Ministry: Restoring Knowledge and Will**
    - Matthew 9:35 – "And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching
      in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing
      every sickness and every disease among the people."
    - **Teaching = Restoring true knowledge** of God and His kingdom.
    - **Healing = Restoring the will and capacity** to choose righteousness.
    - [WB]: Christ's Ministry: TEACHING (Knowledge) + HEALING (Will/Capacity) =
      Complete Restoration
  - **The Word Made Flesh:**
    - John 1:14 – Christ embodied perfect knowledge and demonstrated perfect
      will submission.
    - He is both our example and our enabler in the restoration process.
  - [RQ]: How did Christ's perfect knowledge of the Father, combined with His
    perfect will submission, enable Him to be our perfect substitute and
    example? (Phil 2:5-8)

- **C. Knowledge of Self: The Starting Point for Application**

  - Psalm 139:23-24 – "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
    thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way
    everlasting."
  - We need an objective understanding of our current state.
    - Where do we fall short of God's standard? (Rom 7:18-24)
    - What specific areas need transformation? (e.g., thoughts, words, actions,
      habits).
  - [WB]: KNOWLEDGE OF SELF (Ps 139:23-24) -> Current State vs. Divine Standard
  - [Aside]: Like a patient needing a doctor's diagnosis. We must know where the
    "disease" of sin affects us to apply the "balm of Gilead" (Christ's grace
    and truth) effectively. (Jer 8:22)
  - [RQ]: Why is honest self-assessment, guided by the Holy Spirit and God's
    Word, crucial for the educational process of restoration? (Heb 4:12)
  - [EB]: Hebrews 4:12 (For the word of God is quick, and powerful...a discerner
    of the thoughts and intents of the heart.)

- **D. Renewing the Mind: The Process of Acquiring Knowledge**
  - Romans 12:2 – "...be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye
    may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
  - This "renewing" is an educational process: unlearning error, learning truth.
  - [WB]: Renewing Mind (Rom 12:2) = Unlearn Error + Learn Truth
  - Contemplating holy living, studying Scripture, prayer.
  - **The Fear of the Lord as Foundation:**
    - Psalm 111:10 – "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
      understanding have all they that do his commandments."
    - True knowledge begins with proper reverence for God.

## Main Content Section 3: The Will – Cooperating in Transformation (12 min)

- **The Indispensable Role of the Will**

  - Knowledge alone is insufficient; the will must be engaged.
  - Philippians 2:13 – "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to
    do of his good pleasure."
    - God works in us, but our will must cooperate. He doesn't force.
  - [RQ]: How does God work to influence our will without violating our freedom
    of choice? (Rev 3:20)
  - [EGW]: "The will is the governing power in the nature of man, bringing all
    the other faculties under its sway. The will is not the taste or the
    inclination, but it is the deciding power, which works in the children of
    men unto obedience to God, or unto disobedience." (CH 60.2 or 5T 513.2)

- **"Putting Off" and "Putting On": The Action of a Surrendered Will**

  - Ephesians 4:22-24 – "That ye put off concerning the former conversation the
    old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; And be renewed
    in the spirit of your mind; And that ye put on the new man, which after God
    is created in righteousness and true holiness."
  - [WB]: Draw: Old Man (Eph 4:22) -> CROSS (Gal 2:20) -> New Man (Eph 4:24)
  - This is a daily choice, an act of the will, empowered by God.
    - Unlearning: "Put off" sinful habits, thoughts, attitudes.
    - Learning/Applying: "Put on" Christ-like virtues.
  - [RQ]: What does "putting off the old man" look like practically in our daily
    educational journey towards restoration? (Col 3:5-9)
  - [EB]: John 8:32 (And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
    free – freedom from sin's dominion comes through applying known truth).

- **From Hearers to Doers: The Will in Action**
  - James 1:22-25 – "But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only,
    deceiving your own selves."
  - True transformation is evidenced by action, by obedience born of a
    surrendered will.
  - [Aside]: Knowledge is the map, the will is the engine that moves us along
    the path of restoration. Both are needed to reach the destination: God's
    image.
  - [RQ]: How does consistent action based on God's Word solidify the
    unlearning/learning process in our character development? (Matt 7:24-27)
  - [EGW]: "God requires the training of the mental faculties. He designs that
    His servants shall possess more intelligence and clearer discernment than
    the worldling, and He is displeased with those who are too careless or too
    indolent to become efficient, well-informed workmen." (CSW 22.3) – Implies
    effort of will in acquiring knowledge and skill.

## Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Transformation into God's image (2 Cor 3:18) is God's plan for our
  restoration.
  - Requires:
    - **Knowledge:** Of God's perfect character (our divine pattern) and our own
      need (our starting point).
    - **Will:** Surrendered to God, actively choosing to "put off" and "put on,"
      to "unlearn" and "learn."
- **Christ as Our Perfect Example:** Like Christ, whose knowledge justified many
  (Isa 53:11), we too must pursue knowledge and wisdom as the principal thing
  (Prov 4:7).
- This is the essence of "True Education" – a lifelong process of character
  development, fitting us for eternity.
- [WB]: Image of God (Restored) = Knowledge (God/Self) + Will (Cooperation) ->
  Character Fit for Heaven
- **The Urgency:** We live in solemn times. The work of character perfection,
  reflecting Christ fully, is paramount. (Rev 14:12, Matt 24:44)
  - [RQ]: Knowing Christ's soon return, how does this understanding of
    transformation through knowledge and will impact your daily priorities?
- **Invitation:**
  - Commit to diligently seeking knowledge of God and self through His Word.
  - Choose daily to surrender your will to His transforming power.
  - Embrace this divine educational process to be changed "from glory to glory."
    (2 Cor 3:18)
  - Like Christ, let your knowledge and surrendered will work together to
    reflect God's character and give Him glory.
  - Let us cooperate with God in the restoration of His image within us,
    preparing to meet Him in peace.
