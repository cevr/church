### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce Topic: Investigative Judgment (IJ) & Assurance - often seen as conflicting.
- Core Question: Can we have genuine assurance of salvation while believing in the IJ?
- Define Terms Briefly:
    - IJ: Pre-Advent judgment examining lives of professed believers (based on Dan 8:14).
    - Assurance: Confident trust in God's saving power and our relationship with Him.
- Central Verse Introduction: 1 John 2:1 - Our hope rests in our Advocate, Jesus Christ.

### Section 1: Understanding the Investigative Judgment (12 min)
- **Biblical Foundation:**
    - Daniel 8:14 - Prophetic timing points to Sanctuary "cleansing" starting 1844.
    - Daniel 7:9-10, 22 - Judgment scene: books opened, judgment given *to* the saints (vindication).
    - Hebrews 8:1-2; 9:24 - Christ ministers in the *Heavenly* Sanctuary.
- **Purpose of the IJ:**
    - Vindication of God's character before the universe.
    - Examination of the records (Book of Life, Book of Remembrance, Book of Sin) of all who have professed faith in God.
    - Determines who has genuinely accepted Christ, overcome sin through His power, and developed characters fit for heaven (reflecting His image).
    - Revelation 22:11-12 - Decision precedes the Second Coming ("He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me").
    - `[WB]: Timeline: Cross -> Ascension -> Heavenly Ministry -> 1844 (Dan 8:14) -> IJ -> Close of Probation -> Second Coming`
    - `[RQ]: Why is a judgment necessary *before* Christ returns, according to Daniel 7:22 and Revelation 22:12? (To determine who receives the reward)`
    - `[EB]: Malachi 3:1-3 (Refiner's fire, purifying sons of Levi - judgment purifies God's people)`
- **Focus of Investigation:**
    - Character, not just profession.
    - Alignment with God's Law (James 2:12) as the standard.
    - Genuineness of faith demonstrated by works/obedience (Rev 14:12).

### Section 2: Salvation as Character Restoration (10 min)
- **What is Salvation?**
    - More than forgiveness: Restoration of God's image lost at the Fall (Gen 1:27).
    - 2 Corinthians 3:18 - Changed into His image "from glory to glory".
    - Colossians 1:27 - "Christ in you, the hope of glory." The indwelling Christ transforms.
- **The Process: True Education**
    - Romans 12:2 - Transformed by the *renewing* of the mind (unlearning error, learning truth).
    - Ephesians 4:22-24 - Putting off the "old man" (sinful nature/habits) and putting on the "new man" (Christ-like character). This is an active educational process requiring cooperation.
    - `[WB]: Salvation = Forgiveness (Justification) + Transformation (Sanctification/Restoration of Image - 2 Cor 3:18)`
    - `[EGW]: 'The very image of God is to be reproduced in humanity. The honor of God, the honor of Christ, is involved in the perfection of the character of His people.' (DA 671.4)`
    - `[RQ]: How does viewing salvation as character restoration (an educational process) change our understanding of what the IJ examines? (It examines the fruit/result of this process, cf. Matt 7:21-23)`
    - `[EB]: Galatians 2:20 (Crucified with Christ, He lives in me - the mechanism of transformation)`

### Section 3: Assurance in the Context of Judgment [*] (12 min)
- **What Assurance is NOT:**
    - Presumption: Guarantee of future salvation regardless of choices (Matt 24:13 - "He that shall endure unto the end...").
    - `[EGW]: 'Those who accept the Saviour, however sincere their conversion, should never be taught to say or to feel that they are saved... Those who accept Christ, and in their first confidence say, I am saved, are in danger of trusting to themselves.' (FLB 55.3)`
    - License to Sin: Ignoring God's standard because we feel "saved" (Rom 6:1-2).
- **What True Assurance IS:** (1 John 5:13)
    - **Assurance in Christ's Power & Advocacy:**
        - Hebrews 7:25 - He is able to save completely those who come to God by Him.
        - `[EB]: Jude 24 (He is able to keep you from falling and present you faultless)`
        - 1 John 2:1-2 - We have an Advocate, Jesus Christ the Righteous. Our hope is in His merit, not our own.
    - **Assurance of Present Standing (Conditional):**
        - John 15:4-6 - Assurance comes from *abiding* in Christ NOW. This requires active connection and dependence.
        - 2 Corinthians 13:5 - Command to examine ourselves: Are we *currently* "in the faith"? This implies assurance is linked to present reality.
        - 1 John 1:7 - If we walk in the light... fellowship... blood cleanses. Assurance linked to present obedience.
        - Revelation 14:12 - The saints are identified by endurance, keeping commandments, and faith *of* Jesus (His faith dwelling in them).
        - `[EB]: Revelation 3:5 (He that overcometh... will I not blot out his name from the book of life)`
    - **Assurance of God's Help & Christ's Victory:**
        - John 16:33 - "Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world." His victory enables ours.
        - Philippians 1:6 - He who began a good work *will* perform it *if* we cooperate.
        - `[EB]: Philippians 2:12-13 (Work out salvation... God works in you - divine/human cooperation is key)`
    - `[WB]: Assurance Triangle: 1. Christ's Power/Advocacy (Heb 7:25, 1 Jn 2:1) 2. Our Abiding/Obedience (John 15:4, Rev 14:12) 3. Holy Spirit's Witness (Rom 8:16 - *if* walking in Spirit)`
    - `[Aside]: Assurance isn't a guarantee we *won't* fall; it's confidence in Christ's power to *keep* us and restore us *if* we choose to abide and cooperate daily. Like holding onto a lifeline in a storm – assurance comes from the strength of the line (Christ) and our active grip (faith expressing itself in obedience).`
    - `[RQ]: According to 1 John 2:3-6, what is the tangible evidence that we 'know Him' and can have assurance? (Keeping His commandments, walking as He walked).`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
- **Summary:**
    - The IJ is a solemn reality, focused on the genuineness of our relationship with Christ, evidenced by character transformation (restoration).
    - Salvation is this restoration process – an education in righteousness.
    - True assurance isn't presumption about the future, but confidence in:
        - Christ's perfect advocacy and power (1 John 2:1).
        - Our present connection to Him through abiding faith and obedience (John 15:4, 2 Cor 13:5).
- **The Daily Choice:**
    - Joshua 24:15 - Choose *this day* whom you will serve. Assurance is maintained through daily surrender and cooperation with God's Spirit.
    - Engage in the "True Education": Daily Bible study, prayer, unlearning sin, practicing righteousness.
- **Urgency:**
    - The IJ is ongoing in heaven now. Time is short.
    - Amos 4:12 - "Prepare to meet thy God." Preparation is character readiness.
- **Final Appeal:**
    - Don't fear the judgment; fear separation from Christ.
    - Examine yourselves (2 Cor 13:5). Are you abiding today?
    - Cling to Jesus, our Advocate (1 John 2:1). Trust His power to work in you (Phil 2:13), restoring His image, making you ready.
    - Embrace the assurance found only in a living, obedient relationship with Him.
