### Introduction (5 min)
- **The Great Controversy Context:** Setting the stage - cosmic conflict over God's character and law.
- **The Sanctuary Connection:** Earthly type (Lev 16 - Day of Atonement) points to Heavenly reality (Heb 8-9).
  - `- [WB]: Simple Diagram: Earthly Sanctuary (Courtyard -> Holy -> Most Holy) -> Heavenly Sanctuary (Christ's Ministry)`
- **Defining Investigative Judgment (IJ):** Pre-Advent judgment beginning in 1844 (Dan 8:14), examining the records of professed believers before Christ's return.
  - `- [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.)`
- **Purpose of Study:** To understand the IJ biblically, see its connection to the Gospel, and grasp its relevance for us today as part of God's restorative plan.
  - `- [RQ]: Why would a loving God need to investigate the lives of His people before Jesus returns?`

### Main Content Section 1: Christ the Investigator (7 min) - Biblical Basis
- **Christ Knows His Own:** Jesus' intimate knowledge.
  - `- Revelation 2:23 - "I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works."`
  - `- [WB]: Key Phrase: "Searcheth Hearts" (Rev 2:23) -> Investigation`
  - `- Reasoning:** Christ Himself declares His investigative role before giving rewards.
- **A Time for Judgment & Reward:** Prophetic timing.
  - `- Revelation 11:18 - "...and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets..."`
  - `- [RQ]: How does knowing Christ investigates *before* rewarding impact our understanding of grace and works? (Rev 2:23, 11:18)`
- **The Heavenly Courtroom Scene:** Books are examined.
  - `- Daniel 7:9-10 - "I beheld till the thrones were cast down... the judgment was set, and the books were opened."`
  - `- [WB]: Draw: Throne -> Ancient of Days -> Son of Man -> Books Opened (Dan 7:9-10, 13)`
  - `- [EGW]: 'The books of record in heaven, in which the names and the deeds of men are registered, are to determine the decisions of the judgment.' (GC 480.2)`
  - `- [EB]: Malachi 3:1-3 (He is like a refiner's fire... purify the sons of Levi)`

### Main Content Section 2: Purpose & Scope - Gospel & Repentance (10 min) [*] - Unpacking the Why
- **Investigation Leads to Repentance:** Christ's desire is restoration, not just condemnation.
  - `- Revelation 2:14-16 - Call to Pergamum: "Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly..."`
  - `- Reasoning:** The investigation reveals sin *so that* repentance and cleansing can occur. This is part of the educational process of unlearning error.
  - `- [Aside]: Like a doctor diagnosing an illness not to condemn the patient, but to prescribe the cure. The IJ reveals our need for the Remedy - Christ's righteousness.`
- **Judgment According to the Gospel:** The standard is revealed truth.
  - `- Romans 2:16 - "In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel."`
  - `- [WB]: Equation: Judgment = By Jesus Christ + According to the Gospel (Rom 2:16)`
  - `- Reasoning:** The Gospel itself contains the standard by which lives are measured.
- **The Gospel Includes the Judgment Hour:** A present truth message.
  - `- Revelation 14:6-7 - "Fear God... give glory... the hour of his judgment is come..." proclaimed with the everlasting gospel.`
  - `- [RQ]: Why is the announcement of the judgment hour *part* of the "everlasting gospel"? (Rev 14:6-7)`
  - `- [EGW]: 'The work of the investigative judgment and the blotting out of sins is to be accomplished before the second advent of the Lord.' (GC 485.1)`
  - `- Reasoning:** Understanding the judgment motivates true worship and preparation.
- **Gospel Call = Repentance & Belief:** Foundation of Christian experience.
  - `- Mark 1:14-15 - Jesus preached: "Repent ye, and believe the gospel."`
  - `- Reasoning:** Repentance (turning from sin/unlearning) is integral to accepting the gospel, which is relevant to the IJ's examination.

### Main Content Section 3: Evidence Examined - Faith & Obedience (10 min) - Character Restoration
- **True Faith Transforms:** Baptism symbolizes death to sin, resurrection to new life.
  - `- Romans 6:1-4 - "Shall we continue in sin...? God forbid... walk in newness of life."`
  - `- [WB]: Diagram: Old Life (Sin) -> Baptism (Death/Burial w Christ) -> New Life (Obedience/Restoration) (Rom 6:4)`
  - `- Reasoning:** Genuine faith results in a changed life; this transformation is the evidence examined. This is the fruit of True Education.
- **Fruits as Evidence:** Faith, love, patience demonstrate God's work.
  - `- 2 Thessalonians 1:3-5 - Growing faith/love/patience = "manifest token of the righteous judgment of God."`
  - `- [EGW]: 'Character is the only thing we can take from this world to the next. Should we not then devote the time of this probation to the acquiring of that which is eternal?' (COL 332.2) (Paraphrase/Summarize if needed)`
  - `- Reasoning:** The character developed through God's grace is the evidence weighed in the judgment.
- **Obedience to the Gospel is Key:** Disobedience has consequences.
  - `- 2 Thessalonians 1:8 - Taking vengeance on "them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."`
  - `- [RQ]: How does understanding the IJ clarify the relationship between faith and obedience? (Rom 6:1-4, 2 Thess 1:8)`
  - `- [EB]: Matthew 22:1-14 (Parable of the Wedding Garment - need for Christ's righteousness)`
- **Judgment Starts with God's Household:** Accountability for professed believers.
  - `- 1 Peter 4:17 - "For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God..."`
  - `- Reasoning:** Those who claim God's name are examined first to see if their lives align with their profession.

### Main Content Section 4: The Standard & The Commission (5 min) [*] - Practical Implications
- **The Gospel Commission:** Preach, Believe, Be Baptized.
  - `- Mark 16:15-16 - "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel... He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved..."`
  - `- Reasoning:** The scope of the gospel message is universal, preceding the final judgment.
- **The Full Gospel = Teaching Obedience:** Not just belief, but discipleship.
  - `- Matthew 28:19-20 - "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you..."`
  - `- [WB]: Gospel = Preach (Mark 16) + Teach Obedience (Matt 28)`
  - `- Reasoning:** The standard of judgment includes obedience to *all* Christ taught, reflecting the restoration of God's image.
  - `- [EB]: Revelation 22:11-12 (He that is unjust, let him be unjust still... Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me...)`

### Conclusion and Appeal (8 min)
- **Summary of Key Truths:**
  - IJ is a biblical reality, centered on Christ's ministry in the Heavenly Sanctuary (Dan 7, Rev 14:7).
  - It's part of the Gospel, designed for restoration and vindication, not arbitrary condemnation (Rev 2:16, Rom 2:16).
  - It examines the reality of our relationship with Christ, evidenced by a transformed character (faith & obedience) (Rom 6, 2 Thess 1).
  - It begins with the "house of God" (1 Pet 4:17).
- **Relevance Today - The Urgency:**
  - We are living in the "hour of His judgment" (Rev 14:7).
  - `- [RQ]: Knowing our lives are being reviewed now, how should this impact our daily choices and priorities?`
  - This understanding fuels the final warning message (Three Angels' Messages).
- **The Call to Preparation:**
  - Need for genuine repentance, faith, and surrender to Christ.
  - Cooperate with the Holy Spirit in the **educational process of unlearning sin and learning righteousness** - restoring God's image.
  - `- [Aside]: Like students preparing for final exams, knowing the time is short motivates diligent study and application. Our 'subject' is Christ's character.`
  - Seek Christ as Advocate (1 John 2:1) and High Priest (Heb 4:14-16).
- **Final Appeal:** Invitation to examine our hearts, confess sin, claim Christ's righteousness, and walk in "newness of life" (Rom 6:4), ready to meet Him. Trust in His grace and power for transformation.
  - `- [EGW]: 'We are now living in the great day of atonement... While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan accuses them before God as transgressors.' (GC 484.2) (Summarize)`
