### **Introduction (5 min)**

-   Welcome and opening prayer.
-   The question of what happens after death is one of humanity's oldest.
-   Nearly every world religion and philosophy is built upon one of two answers.
-   [RQ]: Is it possible that the most widespread belief about death is actually based on the very first lie told to humanity?
-   This isn't a minor doctrine; understanding this truth is a shield against Satan's most powerful end-time deceptions.
-   Our study goal: To let the Bible, and the Bible alone, define death and our hope for the future. This is part of our "True Education" in unlearning foundational error.

### **Section 1: The Origin of the Lie (8 min)**

-   **The Setting:** The Garden of Eden, a test of loyalty and belief in God's Word.
-   **God's Clear Command & Warning:** Genesis 2:16-17
    -   God sets a clear boundary.
    -   The consequence is explicit: "thou shalt surely die."
-   **Satan's Direct Contradiction:** Genesis 3:1-4
    -   He first casts doubt on God's character ("Yea, hath God said...?").
    -   Then, the first lie is spoken: "Ye shall not surely die." (v. 4)
-   [WB]: Draw two columns.
    -   **God's Word:** "Thou shalt surely die" (Gen 2:17) -> TRUTH
    -   **Satan's Word:** "Ye shall not surely die" (Gen 3:4) -> THE LIE
-   [RQ]: Why would Satan's first lie be about the consequence of sin? (Hint: If there's no real death, is sin really that serious? Does God's law have authority?)
-   [EGW]: 'The theory of the immortality of the soul was one of those false doctrines that Rome, borrowing from paganism, incorporated into the religion of Christendom. Martin Luther classed it with the "monstrous fables that form part of the Roman dunghill of decretals."' (GC 549.1)
-   [EB]: John 8:44 (Jesus identifies Satan as the father of lies).

### **Section 2: The Biblical Definition of Death (12 min) [*]**

-   **The Nature of Man:** How were we made?
    -   Genesis 2:7 - "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."
    -   [WB]: Equation: Dust (Body) + Breath of Life (Spirit from God) = Living Soul (A living being).
    -   The "soul" is not a separate, conscious entity; it is the *result* of the union of body and breath.
    -   [EB]: Ecclesiastes 12:7 (At death, the process reverses: dust returns to earth, spirit/breath returns to God who gave it).
-   **The Condition in Death:** What does the Bible say happens?
    -   Ecclesiastes 9:5-6 - "For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing... their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished."
    -   Psalm 146:4 - "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish."
    -   [RQ]: If thoughts perish and the dead know nothing, can they be in heaven praising God or in hell being tormented? How does this simple truth dismantle so many popular ideas?
-   **The Metaphor for Death:** Jesus' own words.
    -   John 11:11-14 - Jesus calls the death of Lazarus a "sleep." He had to explain it plainly to the disciples who were culturally conditioned to think otherwise.
    -   This is the consistent biblical model: a state of unconscious rest.
    -   [EB]: Daniel 12:2 ("many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake...").
-   **Who Has Immortality?**
    -   1 Timothy 6:15-16 - Describes God as the one "who only hath immortality."
    -   If God *only* has it, then by definition, we do not possess it inherently. It is a gift to be given.
    -   [Aside]: We don't have "immortal souls"; we are candidates for immortality, a gift granted at the resurrection through Christ (1 Cor 15:51-54). This is the core of the Gospel promise.

### **Section 3: The Danger of the Lie & Last-Day Urgency (12 min)**

-   **The Lie is Satan's Enchanted Ground:**
    -   If the dead are not dead, who are people communicating with in seances, through mediums, or in supposed visitations?
    -   2 Corinthians 11:14 - "And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."
    -   [RQ]: If Satan can appear as an angel of light, can his demons not appear as our departed loved ones? (Rev 16:14)
-   **The Foundation of Spiritualism:**
    -   The belief in an immortal soul opens the door to communication with "spirits of devils."
    -   Revelation 16:13-14 - Unclean spirits like frogs, the "spirits of devils, working miracles," go forth to deceive the whole world before Armageddon.
    -   [WB]: The Lie (Immortal Soul) -> Doorway to Spiritualism -> Final Deception (Rev 16:14).
    -   [Aside]: This isn't just about Ouija boards. It's in movies, books, and even grief counseling that encourages "talking" to the deceased. It's a subtle unlearning of biblical truth and a learning of satanic principles.
-   **A Biblical Warning:**
    -   Isaiah 8:19-20 - "And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits... should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the dead? To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them."
    -   Our only safety is in God's Word. Any spiritual experience must be tested against Scripture.
-   [EB]: 1 Samuel 28 (The "spirit" of Samuel appearing to Saul was a familiar spirit, a demonic impersonation, not the prophet himself).
-   [EB]: Luke 16:19-31 (The parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus was a parable using common folklore to teach a lesson about earthly choices, not a literal description of the afterlife. Its point is in v. 31: "If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.")

### **Conclusion & Appeal (8 min)**

-   **Summary of Truth:**
    -   The lie began in Eden: "Ye shall not surely die."
    -   The Bible teaches death is an unconscious sleep. Man is mortal.
    -   This lie is the foundation for Satan's final, powerful deceptions through spiritualism.
-   **The True Christian Hope:**
    -   Our hope is not in surviving death, but in being *rescued from* death.
    -   1 Thessalonians 4:15-17 - The dead in Christ do not go to heaven at death. They rest, awaiting the voice of the archangel and the trump of God.
    -   The "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) is the Second Coming of Jesus, when the dead are resurrected and the living are changed, and we all receive the gift of immortality together.
-   **The Appeal:**
    -   Let us commit to being a people of the Book. Let us unlearn the fables of paganism and stand firmly on the "It is written."
    -   This truth protects our minds, guards our faith, and keeps our hope fixed on the only one who can give life: Jesus Christ, the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25).
    -   Will you choose to believe God's Word over the first great lie?
