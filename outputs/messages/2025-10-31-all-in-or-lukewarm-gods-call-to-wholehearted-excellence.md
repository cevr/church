### Introduction (6 min)
- Frame the need: “Doing the bare minimum” vs. God’s standard (Col 3:23-24; Mark 12:30)
  - [RQ]: If God is our audience, what does “heartily, as to the Lord” exclude? (Col 3:23)
  - [WB]: Key Term: HEARTILY = "out of the soul" (Col 3:23) vs. MINIMUM = "as little as needed"
- Great Controversy lens: Excellence = loyalty; minimum = lukewarm compromise (Rev 3:15-16)
- [Aside]: In any craft, “minimum compliance” yields fragile work; excellence yields durability. How much more in character that must endure eternity. (Eccl 9:10)

---

### Section 1 (10 min) – Wholehearted vs. Half-hearted: Biblical Foundation
- Mark 12:30 — All heart, soul, mind, strength = comprehensive devotion
  - Key Truth for Restoration: God claims the whole person; excellence is love expressed in totality.
  - [RQ]: What part of “all” allows for “enough to get by”? (Mark 12:30)
  - [WB]: Diagram: HEART + MIND + SOUL + STRENGTH = WHOLE (Mk 12:30)
  - [EGW]: "God requires the entire surrender of the heart, before justification can take place..." (SC 43.3)
- Ecclesiastes 9:10 — “Do it with thy might” = intentional, diligent effort
  - [RQ]: What “might” is available to us that we’ve left unused? (Eccl 9:10)
  - [WB]: Key Term: MIGHT = full capacity; NOT: partial effort (Eccl 9:10)
- Jeremiah 48:10 — “Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully” (negligently)
  - Key Truth: Half-hearted ministry misrepresents God.
  - [RQ]: How does careless work distort God’s character before the world? (Jer 48:10)
- Colossians 3:23-24 — Audience shift: from men to the Lord; reward orientation
  - [Aside]: When the supervisor changes, effort changes. Seeing Christ as Supervisor transforms quality.
  - [EB]: Romans 12:1 (Living sacrifice—God deserves our best, not blemished leftovers)

### Section 2 (12 min) – Christ’s Laodicean Diagnosis & Last-day Urgency [*]
- Revelation 3:15-16 — Lukewarm provokes divine nausea
  - [RQ]: What does lukewarm look like in time, money, worship, witness? (Rev 3:15-16)
  - [WB]: Thermometer: COLD | LUKEWARM | HOT (Rev 3:15-16)
- Revelation 3:17 — Deception of self-sufficiency: rich/need nothing vs. actually wretched, poor, blind, naked
  - Key Truth: Self-estimate vs. Christ’s estimate; indolence grows in self-deception.
  - [WB]: Contrast List: SELF-REPORT vs. CHRIST’S DIAGNOSIS (Rev 3:17)
- Revelation 3:18-19 — Remedy: buy gold, white raiment, eyesalve; be zealous and repent
  - Gold = faith working by love (Gal 5:6); tried faith refined (1 Pet 1:7)
  - White raiment = Christ’s righteousness covering His people (Isa 61:10); fine linen = righteousness of saints (Rev 19:8)
  - Eyesalve = Spirit-given sight/discernment (Eph 1:18); the anointing teaches all things (1 John 2:27)
  - [WB]: Callout: ZEAL = fervent, diligent love in action; opposite of sloth/apathy (Rom 12:11; Titus 2:14)
  - [RQ]: How does zeal (earnestness) oppose the “bare minimum” spirit? (Rev 3:19)
  - [EB]: 1 Peter 1:7 (Gold tried in the fire—faith purified = excellence in motive)
- Urgency: Investigative Judgment perspective
  - [EB]: Daniel 8:14 (Cleansing of the sanctuary—Heaven’s work now calls for wholehearted cooperation on earth)
  - [WB]: Draw: Earthly Day of Atonement → Heavenly Cleansing (Lev 16; Dan 8:14; Heb 9)
  - [EB]: Hebrews 8:1-2 (Our High Priest now ministering—our response must match Heaven’s earnest work)
- [EGW]: "The greatest want of the world is the want of men... as true to duty as the needle to the pole..." (Ed 57.3)

### Section 3 (11 min) – Practical Application: True Education to Excellence (with Case Studies)
- Malachi 1:6-14 — Blemished offerings: giving God the least
  - Need: We often reserve our best for self; God receives leftovers.
  - Key Truth: Excellence honors God; cheap religion blasphemes His name.
  - [RQ]: What would “unblemished” look like in my worship, work, and witness? (Mal 1:7-8, 13-14)
  - Based on Malachi 1: Steps in the educational journey:
    1) Unlearn: offering God leftover time/attention/resources.
    2) Learn/Apply: firstfruits devotion; plan excellence for God first.
    - [WB]: Action Steps: FIRSTFRUITS > Leftovers (Mal 1; Prov 3:9)
- Matthew 25:14-30 — The talents: “slothful and wicked” vs. “well done”
  - Need: Fear + laziness = burying gifts.
  - Key Truth: Fruitful diligence = faithfulness; minimalism = unfaithfulness with loss.
  - [RQ]: What “hole” have I dug to hide God’s entrusted gifts? (Matt 25:25)
  - Steps from Matt 25:
    1) Unlearn: procrastination disguised as humility.
    2) Learn/Apply: small faithful increments; risk obedience; report progress to the Master.
  - [WB]: Draw: Gift → Invest → Multiply → Account (Matt 25)
- 1 Samuel 15:13-23 — Saul’s partial obedience
  - Need: Partial compliance presented as obedience.
  - Key Truth: To obey is better than sacrifice; excellence = full compliance with God’s word.
  - [RQ]: Where am I redefining obedience to suit convenience? (1 Sam 15:22-23)
- Positive contrast: Mark 12:41-44 — The widow’s “all”
  - Key Truth: Excellence isn’t abundance but totality of heart; God measures by sacrifice and love.
  - [RQ]: What is my “two mites” in this season? (Mark 12:44)
- Readiness and quality
  - [EB]: 1 Corinthians 3:13 (Work revealed by fire—quality matters eternally)
  - [EGW]: "As the will of man cooperates with the will of God, it becomes omnipotent." (COL 333.1)
  - [Aside]: Athletes train past comfort to finish well; the Spirit trains us beyond minimums to Christlike endurance (Heb 12:1-2).

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
- Summation: God’s excellence standard = whole heart (Mark 12:30), whole might (Eccl 9:10), whole life (Col 3:23-24); Laodicea = minimum mindset with eternal risk (Rev 3:16)
  - [WB]: Takeaway: MINIMUM → LUKEWARM → VOMIT (Rev 3:16) vs. WHOLEHEARTED → “WELL DONE” (Matt 25:21)
  - [RQ]: What one concrete “firstfruit” change will I make this week to move from minimum to wholehearted? (Rom 12:1; Col 3:23)
- Urgent readiness in the Judgment hour (Dan 8:14; Heb 8:1-2)
  - Invitation: Buy the gold, wear the raiment, receive the eyesalve—embrace zeal and repent (Rev 3:18-19)
- Commitment: Consecrate all (time, talent, treasure, temper, testimony) to God’s glory—today.
- Prayer focus: Entire surrender; Spirit-led diligence; faithful use of gifts; readiness for “Well done.”
