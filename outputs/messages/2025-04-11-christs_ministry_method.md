### Introduction (6 min)

- The Challenge: Reaching a world that seems increasingly distant.
- The Divine Blueprint: God's method hasn't changed.
  - Reference the core concept: "Christ's method alone will give true
    success..." (MH 143.3 - _will quote fully later_)
- The Motivation: Compassion for the lost and scattered (Matt 9:36).
  - [RQ]: Do we see the multitudes as Jesus saw them? (Matt 9:36)
- Study Goal: To break down Christ's method from Scripture and see how to apply
  it today.

### Section 1: Mingling with Compassion (10 min)

- **Principle 1: Intentional Presence - He Mingled.**
  - Jesus went _to_ the people (Matt 9:35a - "went about all the cities and
    villages").
  - He didn't wait for them to come to the temple; He entered their world (Mark
    1:38-39 - "throughout all Galilee").
  - [WB]: Mingling = Intentional Presence & Availability (Matt 9:35)
  - [RQ]: How often do we intentionally place ourselves where the 'multitudes'
    are, outside our church walls? (Mark 1:38)
  - [EB]: Acts 17:16-17 (Paul reasoning in the marketplace - mingling in
    Athens).
- **The Driving Force: Compassion.**
  - Not just presence, but presence with purpose: He _saw_ them and was _moved_
    (Matt 9:36).
  - [EGW]: 'Christ's method alone will give true success in reaching the people.
    The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He showed His
    sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won their confidence. Then
    He bade them, “Follow Me.”' (MH 143.3)
  - [RQ]: Is our mingling driven by genuine compassion or just duty? (Matt 9:36)
  - [WB]: Compassion (Matt 9:36) -> Action (Mingling/Healing)
  - [EB]: Matthew 14:14 (Compassion moved Him to heal).

### Section 2: Winning Confidence Through Service [*] (12 min)

- **Principle 2: Demonstrated Care - He Won Their Confidence.**
  - How? By desiring their good, showing sympathy, ministering to needs (MH
    143.3).
- **Example: Zacchaeus (Luke 19:1-10)**
  - Jesus sought out the seeker, even the despised (v. 5 - "make haste, and come
    down").
  - He met a social need: Acceptance, fellowship (v. 5b - "today I must abide at
    thy house").
  - [Aside]: Imagine the shock! The holy Teacher inviting Himself to the house
    of a 'sinner'. This broke down walls instantly.
  - Result: Open heart, transformation (v. 8 - "Behold, Lord, the half of my
    goods I give...").
  - [WB]: Seeking (v.10) + Acceptance (v.5) -> Open Heart (v.8)
  - [RQ]: Are we willing to associate with the 'Zacchaeuses' of our community to
    show Christ's love? (Luke 19:7)
  - [EB]: Luke 15:1-2 (Pharisees murmur about Jesus eating with sinners - a
    consistent pattern).
- **Example: Woman at the Well (John 4:7-26)**
  - Breaking Barriers: Social, racial, gender (v. 9 - "How is it that thou,
    being a Jew...").
  - Meeting Felt Needs: Addressed her physical thirst (v. 7) to open the door to
    her spiritual thirst (v. 10, 13-14).
  - Respectful Dialogue: Spoke truth directly but without condemnation initially
    (v. 16-18).
  - [WB]: Physical Need (v.7) -> Spiritual Conversation (v.10) -> Revealed Truth
    (v.26)
  - [RQ]: Do we listen long enough to understand the real needs beneath the
    surface? (John 4:15 vs. 4:16-18)

### Section 3: Bidding Them Follow (10 min)

- **Principle 3: The Invitation - Then He Bade Them Follow.**
  - The call comes _after_ connection and confidence are established.
  - It's a direct, personal invitation: "Follow Me" (Matt 4:19).
  - [WB]: Mingling -> Confidence -> Invitation: "Follow Me" (Matt 4:19)
- **The Nature of the Call:**
  - It's a call to discipleship, to learn His ways, to become like Him.
  - Not just belief, but allegiance and transformation.
  - [RQ]: When we share the gospel, is the call clearly to follow Jesus Himself,
    not just join an organization? (Matt 4:19)
- **The Result of the Method:**
  - Woman at the Well: Immediately becomes a witness (John 4:28-30). Her
    testimony, built on genuine encounter, brings others (v. 39).
  - [Aside]: Her transformation was the proof. She didn't need a theology
    degree; she had met the Messiah, and her changed life drew others.
  - Zacchaeus: Demonstrates immediate fruits of repentance (Luke 19:8).
  - [EGW]: 'We must live among them, and know them, if we would benefit them.
    When confidence is gained, then we can lead them to Jesus.' (RH, April
    10, 1888)
  - [EB]: Mark 1:17-20 (Immediate response of disciples to the call).
  - [EB]: John 1:40-46 (Andrew finds Peter, Philip finds Nathanael - the natural
    result of following).

### Conclusion and Appeal (7 min)

- **Summary:** Christ's method is simple, profound, and effective:
  1.  Go where people are, moved by compassion (Mingling).
  2.  Show genuine care, meet needs, build trust (Winning Confidence).
  3.  Invite them into a relationship with Him (Bidding Follow).
- [RQ]: Which part of this divine method do we most need to cultivate in our own
  lives and church community?
- This isn't just _a_ method; it's _the_ method modeled by the Master Worker.
- [WB]: Christ's Method = Success (MH 143.3)
- **Appeal:** Let's commit to studying Christ's life not just for doctrine, but
  for His _method_. Let's ask God for His compassion, courage to mingle, wisdom
  to serve, and boldness to invite others to follow Him.
- Prayer of commitment to practice Christ's method.
