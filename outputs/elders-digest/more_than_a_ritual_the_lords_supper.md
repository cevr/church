### Introduction (5 min)
*   Hook: How do we typically view the Lord's Supper? Just a routine? A solemn moment? **(RQ)**
*   Purpose: To rediscover the profound meaning God embedded in this ordinance, guided *directly* by Scripture.
*   [Whiteboard: Title - "More Than a Ritual: The Lord's Supper"]
*   Overview: It's a Memorial, a Proclamation, requires Self-Examination, and points to our Blessed Hope.

### Section 1: Memorial, Not Sacrifice (10 min)
*   **Foundation: Remembrance**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:23-25. Emphasize Christ's words: "Do this in remembrance of Me."
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:23-25 -> REMEMBRANCE]
    *   This is the primary command associated with the emblems.
*   **Crucial Distinction: Not a Re-Sacrifice**
    *   Read Heb 10:10. Christ's sacrifice was *once for all*. Perfect and complete.
    *   [Whiteboard: Heb 10:10 -> ONCE FOR ALL Sacrifice]
    *   Why is understanding this vital? **(RQ)** (Protects from ritualism, magnifies Christ's finished work).
*   **What We Remember:**
    *   His Incarnation (John 1:14), Sinless Life (Heb 4:15), Substitutionary Death (Isa 53:5-6), Victorious Resurrection (1 Cor 15:3-4), Ongoing Priestly Ministry (Heb 7:25).
    *   [Whiteboard: Remember -> Life, Death, Resurrection, Ministry]
*   **Personal Contemplation:**
    *   A sacred time to *personally* reflect: What does His sacrifice mean for *my* sin, *my* hope, *my* life today? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Public Witness & Proclamation [*] (12 min)
*   **Public Identification:**
    *   Partaking is a visible act of aligning with Christ and His body, the church.
    *   Connect to Rom 10:9-11 (Confession & Belief). Communion is a non-verbal "Amen" to the Gospel.
    *   [Whiteboard: Rom 10:9-11 -> Public Identification]
    *   How does this simple, quiet act become a powerful testimony? **(RQ)**
*   **Gospel Proclamation:**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:26a. We "proclaim" (Gk: *kataggellō* - declare, announce publicly) the Lord's death.
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:26a -> PROCLAIM Christ's Death]
    *   The broken bread and cup preach the core Gospel: His body broken, His blood shed *for us*.
    *   [Aside: Like raising a banner in enemy territory, Communion declares Christ's victory over sin and death, staking a claim for His kingdom in our lives and the world.]
*   **Hopeful Anticipation:**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:26b. We proclaim His death *"till He comes."*
    *   Connect to Christ's promise: John 14:1-3.
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:26b -> UNTIL HE COMES (Hope!)]
    *   It anchors us: looking back in gratitude, looking forward in hope.
    *   [Analogy (from 1 Cor 11:26): Like a soldier keeping watch, remembering past orders while eagerly awaiting the commander's return.]

### Section 3: Solemn Preparation & Self-Examination (12 min)
*   **Divine Mandate: Examine Yourself**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:28. "But let a man examine himself..."
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:28 -> EXAMINE YOURSELF (Before)]
    *   This is not optional; it's commanded preparation.
    *   What are we examining? **(RQ)** Our heart's attitude, relationship with God (sincerity, known sin), relationship with others (reconciliation needed?), understanding of the ordinance's meaning.
*   **Sober Warning: Unworthy Participation**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:27, 29-30. Warning against partaking "unworthily."
    *   "Unworthily" refers to the *manner* - carelessly, irreverently, hypocritically, with unconfessed sin, treating it as common, trusting the ritual itself.
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:27, 29-30 -> Unworthy Manner -> Divine Chastisement]
    *   This isn't about achieving sinless perfection *before* partaking, but about approaching with reverence, honesty, and a repentant heart. **(RQ)**
    *   **Link to Investigative Judgment:** This call to personal examination reflects the principle of accountability. Our lives are reviewed; do our actions align with our profession of faith in the sacrifice we commemorate? **(RQ)**
*   **The Path Forward: Judging Ourselves**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:31. "For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
    *   This means honest self-assessment, confession (1 John 1:9), and seeking reconciliation (Matt 5:23-24) *before* partaking.
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:31 -> Judge Ourselves (Confess/Reconcile)]
*   **God's Loving Purpose in Chastisement:**
    *   Read 1 Cor 11:32. Discipline is corrective, not punitive damnation. "...chastened by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world."
    *   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 11:32 -> Corrective Love]
    *   [Aside: God's discipline during Communion is like a loving parent pulling a child back from danger. It's not punitive anger, but protective care for our eternal well-being, urging us back into alignment with His grace.]
*   **Connection to Character Perfection:**
    *   The entire process—examination, confession, reconciliation, partaking worthily—is a powerful tool God uses for our sanctification, building integrity and holiness.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
*   **Summary:** The Lord's Supper is rich with meaning: A **Memorial** (1 Cor 11:24-25) of a finished sacrifice (Heb 10:10), a public **Proclamation** (1 Cor 11:26) and **Identification** (Rom 10:9), fueling our **Hope** (1 Cor 11:26b), and demanding solemn **Self-Examination** (1 Cor 11:28).
*   **Practical Application Recap:** How should we approach the table?
    *   With **Reverence**: Remembering His sacrifice.
    *   With **Reflection**: Considering its personal meaning.
    *   With **Affirmation**: Identifying with Christ publicly.
    *   With **Proclamation**: Sharing the Gospel message visually.
    *   With **Anticipation**: Eagerly awaiting His return.
    *   With **Examination**: Honestly assessing our hearts (1 Cor 11:28).
    *   With **Confession & Reconciliation**: Making things right (1 Cor 11:31; 1 John 1:9; Matt 5:23-24).
    *   With **Sincerity**: Not out of mere habit or ritual.
*   **Invitation:** Let's commit to approaching the Lord's Supper not as a mere ritual, but as the profound spiritual exercise God intended—a means of grace, remembrance, proclamation, and character transformation.
*   Final Thought: May this ordinance always draw us closer to the heart of Christ and prepare us for His soon return.
