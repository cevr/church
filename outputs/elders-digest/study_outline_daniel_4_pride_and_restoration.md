### Section 1: God's Revelation & Warning (10 min)

-   **God Reaches Out:** How does God communicate with Nebuchadnezzar? (Dreams, Daniel's interpretation - Dan 4:5-18).
    -   God reveals Himself through conscience, startling events, and direct messages.
    -   `[Write on board: God Speaks: Dreams (4:5), Conscience, Events]`
-   **The Dream's Message:** The great tree representing Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom and its decreed humbling (Dan 4:10-17).
    -   Key point: "...the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will..." (Dan 4:17).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Dan 4:17 - God is SOVEREIGN]`
-   **The Call to Repentance:** Daniel's plea – a chance to avert judgment (Dan 4:27).
    -   "Break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity." (Dan 4:27)
    -   God's grace offers a way out *before* judgment falls. Repentance can avert disaster.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Dan 4:27 -> Repentance = Averting Judgment?]`
    -   How does this apply to warnings we receive today? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Pride's Peak & God's Sovereignty [*] (12 min)

-   **The Danger of Prosperity:** A year passes, the warning seemingly forgotten (Dan 4:28-29).
    -   Pride often flourishes when things are going well. **(RQ)**
-   **The Moment of Pride:** Nebuchadnezzar surveys Babylon (Dan 4:30).
    -   "Is not this great Babylon, that *I* have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of *my* power, and for the honour of *my* majesty?"
    -   `[Write on board: Dan 4:30 - "I... MY... MY..."]`
    -   Forgetting the Source leads to self-exaltation.
-   **Immediate Consequence:** God's judgment falls swiftly (Dan 4:31-33).
    -   "While the word was in the king's mouth..." - God hears the heart's pride.
    -   Neglecting to recognize God results in losing divine protection and even basic reason.
    -   God permits setbacks (even severe ones) to foster humility and dependence.
    -   `[Analogy (from text): Like a magnificent tree suddenly cut down - pride precedes the fall.]`
-   **God's Unchanging Sovereignty:** Even in judgment, God's purpose (teaching humility and His rule) is being worked out (Dan 4:32).
    -   Humanity is utterly dependent on God, whether acknowledged or not.

### Section 3: The Pit, the Turning Point & Restoration (12 min)

-   **The Bottom of the Pit:** Nebuchadnezzar's condition – living like an animal (Dan 4:33).
    -   A graphic picture of humanity separated from God's sustaining presence and reason.
-   **The Turning Point:** "And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me..." (Dan 4:34a).
    -   `[Write on board: Dan 4:34 - LOOKED UP -> Understanding Returned]`
    -   True restoration and sanity begin with acknowledging God's sovereignty.
    -   This echoes the universal invitation: "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth..." (Isa 45:22).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Isa 45:22 - Look -> Be Saved]`
-   **Transformed Heart & Testimony:** Nebuchadnezzar blesses and praises God (Dan 4:34b-35).
    -   He acknowledges God's eternal dominion and absolute power.
    -   God's grace is transformative, changing even the proudest heart.
    -   `[Aside: It's remarkable how God uses even the consequences of our own pride to draw us back. His goal isn't just punishment, but restoration – bringing us back to sanity, back to Him.]`
-   **Full Restoration:** Kingdom, honor, and reason restored – even increased (Dan 4:36).
    -   When we humble ourselves, God lifts us up (James 4:10).
-   **The Final Lesson Learned:** Nebuchadnezzar's concluding praise and warning (Dan 4:37).
    -   "Those that walk in pride he is able to abase."
    -   Victory comes through a repentant heart recognizing God's control.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary of Lessons:**
    -   Pride is a subtle and dangerous trap, especially in success (Dan 4:30).
    -   God is sovereign over all nations and individuals (Dan 4:17, 35).
    -   God uses trials and humility to draw us to Himself (Dan 4:33-34).
    -   True understanding and restoration come from looking up to God (Dan 4:34).
    -   God's grace can transform any heart that repents (Dan 4:37).
-   **Personal Reflection:** Where might pride be subtly present in our lives? Our accomplishments, our knowledge, our righteousness? **(RQ)**
-   **The Source of True Security:** In God alone is true safety, strength, meaning, and purpose found.
    -   `[Metaphor (from text): Are we building our 'kingdom' on our own power, or acknowledging God as the true King and Builder? ]`
-   **Gentle Appeal:** Invitation to examine our hearts, humble ourselves before God, acknowledge His sovereignty daily, and accept His transformative grace. Let's choose to 'look up' before we are brought low.
    -   Commit to recognizing God's hand in blessings and trusting His sovereignty in trials.
