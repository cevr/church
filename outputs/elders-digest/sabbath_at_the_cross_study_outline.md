**Opening Hymn:** #388 "Don't Forget the Sabbath"
"Don't forget the Sabbath, The Lord hath blessed the day! Of all the week the brightest, Of all the week the best; It brings repose from labor, It tells of joy and rest. Welcome, welcome, ever welcome, Blessed Sabbath day! Welcome, welcome, ever welcome, Blessed Sabbath day!"

**Closing Hymn:** #390 "We Love Thy Sabbath, Lord"
"We love Thy Sabbath, Lord, And worship at Thy feet; But soon we hope to keep, A Sabbath more complete."

**Central Bible Verse:** Colossians 2:14-17 - "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ."

**Key Supporting Verses:**
*   Leviticus 23:2, 37-38 (Distinction between weekly and annual Sabbaths)

### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with the common question/assertion: "Doesn't Colossians 2 say the Sabbath was nailed to the cross?"
-   Acknowledge the confusion this passage causes.
-   **Importance:** Stress the need for careful Bible study and context to understand God's unchanging character and law. **(RQ)** How can we be sure we are rightly dividing the word of truth (2 Tim 2:15) on such important matters?
-   **Goal:** Today, we'll examine Colossians 2:14-17 closely, using Scripture to interpret Scripture, to see exactly *what* was nailed to the cross and what remains.

### Section 1: The "Handwriting of Ordinances" (10 min)

-   **Focus Verse:** Colossians 2:14 - "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances... nailing it to his cross."
-   **Question:** What is this "handwriting of ordinances" (Greek: *cheirographon tois dogmasin*)?
    -   Not the Ten Commandments (written by God's finger - Ex 31:18).
    -   Relates to decrees, regulations, ordinances written by Moses.
-   **Scriptural Definition:**
    -   Ephesians 2:15: "law of commandments contained in ordinances" (associated with the dividing wall between Jew/Gentile, related to ceremonial system).
    -   Hebrews 9:1, 10: Describes the sanctuary services with their specific rules ("ordinances of divine service," "carnal ordinances").
-   **Connection:** This refers to the ceremonial law, centered around the sanctuary, sacrifices, and rituals that pointed *forward* to Christ.
    -   [Whiteboard: Col 2:14 -> "Handwriting of Ordinances" = Ceremonial Law (Sacrifices, Feasts, Rituals - written by Moses)]
    -   **(RQ)** Why would God distinguish between the law He wrote Himself and the law Moses wrote if they had the same purpose and duration? (Deut 31:24-26 - placed *beside* the ark vs. Ten Commandments *inside* the ark).
-   **Conclusion:** Christ's sacrifice fulfilled the *purpose* of the ceremonial system; thus, its regulations ('ordinances') ceased. They were like an IOU for a debt; once Christ paid the debt on the cross, the IOU was cancelled and nailed there as proof of payment.

### Section 2: Identifying the "Sabbath Days" [*] (12 min)

-   **Focus Verse:** Colossians 2:16 - "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days..."
-   **Key Point:** Notice the *plural* "sabbath days" (Greek: *sabbaton*).
    -   The Fourth Commandment refers to "the sabbath day" (singular - Ex 20:8, 10).
-   **Context is Ceremonial:** Paul lists these "sabbath days" alongside other ceremonial elements: specific food/drink regulations (part of purity laws), annual holydays (feasts), and new moon observances.
    -   [Whiteboard: Col 2:16 List: Meat/Drink | Holyday | New Moon | Sabbath Days (Plural)]
-   **Leviticus 23 Distinction:** This chapter clearly outlines the annual feasts, often called sabbaths (high sabbaths), *distinct* from the weekly seventh-day Sabbath.
    -   Read Lev 23:2 ("feasts of the Lord").
    -   Read Lev 23:3 (The weekly Sabbath - listed first, foundational).
    -   Read Lev 23:4-37 (Lists Passover, Unleavened Bread, Firstfruits, Pentecost, Trumpets, Atonement, Tabernacles - many involved special 'sabbath' rest days, regardless of the day of the week they fell on).
    -   Read Lev 23:37-38: Explicitly distinguishes "the sabbaths of the Lord" (annual, ceremonial) from "the sabbath of the Lord" (weekly, moral, mentioned in v.3).
    -   [Whiteboard: Lev 23:38 -> Annual Sabbaths (Feasts) â‰  Weekly Sabbath (Commandment)]
-   **(RQ)** If Paul meant the weekly Sabbath, why use the plural form and group it with clearly ceremonial observances that were fulfilled in Christ?
-   **Brief Illustration:** Think of house rules versus party rules. The house rules (like the Ten Commandments) are always in effect. The party rules (like the ceremonial laws/feasts) are specific to the event and end when the event's purpose is fulfilled. Colossians 2:16 is discussing the "party rules" that pointed to Christ's first coming.
-   **Conclusion:** The "sabbath days" in Colossians 2:16 are the ceremonial, annual sabbaths of the Jewish religious calendar, tied to the ordinances nailed to the cross.

### Section 3: Shadows Pointing to Christ (10 min)

-   **Focus Verse:** Colossians 2:17 - "Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body [substance] is of Christ."
-   **The Nature of Shadows:**
    -   Hebrews 10:1: "For the law having a shadow (*skia*) of good things to come, and not the very image of the things..."
    -   Shadows are temporary, pointing to a reality (the substance).
    -   The ceremonial law (sacrifices, priesthood, feasts/annual sabbaths) were shadows pointing *forward* to Christ's sacrifice, ministry, and second coming.
    -   [Whiteboard: Draw Arrow: Ceremonial Law/Feasts (Shadow - Col 2:17) ---> Christ's Sacrifice/Ministry (Substance/Body)]
-   **Contrast with Weekly Sabbath:**
    -   The seventh-day Sabbath wasn't instituted as a shadow pointing *forward* to the *first* coming.
    -   It was established at Creation (Gen 2:2-3) *before* sin, as a memorial of God's creative work.
    -   [Whiteboard: Gen 2:2-3 -> Weekly Sabbath = Memorial of Creation (Not a temporary shadow)]
    -   It looks *back* to Creation and *forward* to eternal rest (Heb 4:9).
-   **Christ Affirmed the Moral Law:**
    -   Matthew 5:17-18: Christ came not to destroy the Law (including Ten Commandments) but to fulfill (live out perfectly, show its deep meaning).
    -   **(RQ)** If the weekly Sabbath was abolished, why did Jesus keep it (Luke 4:16), teach about it (Matt 12:1-12), and even give instruction concerning it after His death (Matt 24:20)?
-   [Aside: Think of the ceremonial laws like scaffolding around a building under construction. They served a vital purpose pointing to the finished work, but once Christ (the building) was revealed through His sacrifice, the scaffolding (ceremonial ordinances and their specific sabbaths) was no longer needed. The foundation (Moral Law/Creation Sabbath) remains.]

### Section 4: Application - Living in the Substance (8 min)

-   **Summary:** Colossians 2 clearly distinguishes between two laws:
    -   **Nailed to Cross:** Ceremonial Law (ordinances, annual feasts/sabbaths) - fulfilled by Christ (Col 2:14, 16-17).
    -   **Enduring:** Moral Law (Ten Commandments, including weekly Sabbath) - established at Creation, affirmed by Christ (Gen 2:2-3, Ex 20:8-11, Matt 5:17-18).
-   **Need/Question (from text):** In a world with confusing interpretations, how do we find clarity and assurance about God's will for us today, especially regarding His law and rest? (Col 2:8 warns against philosophy and traditions of men). We need grounding in Scripture to avoid being misled.
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** Christ is the substance! The ceremonial shadows met their reality in Him (Col 2:17). The enduring Moral Law, including the Creation Sabbath, remains as God's standard of love and points us to Him as Creator and Redeemer.
-   **Bridging (from text):** Understanding this distinction frees us from unnecessary burdens (ceremonial regulations) while affirming the blessings of God's eternal principles. It helps us appreciate Christ's sacrifice *more* because we see what He fulfilled. It also clarifies the significance of the weekly Sabbath as a continuing sign of our relationship with the Creator (Ezek 20:12, 20), not a relic of the past.
    -   [Whiteboard: Application: Clarity -> Freedom -> Deeper Appreciation -> Meaningful Sabbath Rest]
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Study Contextually:** When encountering difficult passages like Col 2, commit to studying the surrounding verses and comparing Scripture with Scripture (Acts 17:11).
    2.  **Differentiate the Laws:** Consciously recognize the difference between the temporary ceremonial law (fulfilled) and the enduring moral law (to be lived out in Christ).
    3.  **Embrace the Substance:** Focus your faith on Christ, the reality to which the shadows pointed (Col 2:17).
    4.  **Value the Memorial:** Accept the weekly Sabbath (Ex 20:8-11) not as a shadow, but as God's intended giftâ€”a memorial of Creation and a sign of redemption and relationship with Him (Gen 2:2-3, Heb 4:9).
-   **Invitation:** Let's choose to stand firm in the clarity of God's Word. Let's thank Christ for fulfilling the shadows and joyfully embrace the enduring truths He affirmed, including the blessing of His holy Sabbath day, finding our true rest and delight in Him. Will you commit to studying His Word diligently and accepting the rest He offers?
