### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the concept: Christ's death as a payment, a "ransom."
- Central Question: If it's a ransom, who received the payment? A common point
  of confusion.
- Briefly state the goal: To understand _from Scripture_ the nature of Christ's
  sacrifice and its necessity.
- Read Central Verse: Matthew 20:28.
- **(RQ)** What does "ransom" imply? (Payment, release, debt)
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & Central Question: "A Ransom: To Whom Paid?"]

### Section 1: The Ransom & Sacrifice Defined (8 min)

- **The Need:** Sin created a debt, a separation (Isaiah 59:2).
  - Humanity under condemnation (Romans 3:23, 6:23).
- **The Biblical Principle:** Christ's death described in specific terms:
  - **Ransom:** A price paid for release (Matt 20:28; 1 Tim 2:6).
    - [Whiteboard: RANSOM = Price for Release (Matt 20:28)]
  - **Sacrifice/Propitiation:** An offering that satisfies divine requirements,
    turning away wrath (1 John 2:2; 1 John 4:10; Rom 3:25).
    - Propitiation = Appeasement/Satisfaction of _Justice/Law_, not personal
      anger.
    - [Whiteboard: PROPITIATION = Satisfies Justice/Law (1 John 2:2)]
- **(RQ)** Why are both terms important? (Ransom = freedom bought; Propitiation
  = how freedom was possible under divine justice).

### Section 2: Refuting Errors - To Whom NOT Paid [*] (7 min)

- **Error 1: Ransom Paid to Satan.**
  - Historical theory, but unbiblical.
  - Satan is the captor, but holds no _legal_ right demanding payment _from
    God_.
  - God owes Satan nothing. Christ conquered Satan (Heb 2:14).
  - **(RQ)** Does Scripture ever suggest God negotiates with or pays Satan for
    souls? (No - He conquers & delivers).
- **Error 2: Sacrifice to Appease an Angry Father.**
  - Misrepresents God's character.
  - God _initiated_ the plan out of LOVE (John 3:16; 1 John 4:10).
    - Read 1 John 4:10 - God sent His Son _because_ He loved us.
    - [Whiteboard: God's LOVE initiated the sacrifice (1 John 4:10)]
  - The sacrifice wasn't to change God's mind, but to meet the unchangeable
    demands of His character expressed in His Law.
  - Christ's sacrifice was _voluntary_ (John 10:17-18).
    - Read John 10:17-18 - "No man taketh it from me..."
    - [Whiteboard: Christ's death = VOLUNTARY (John 10:18)]

### Section 3: The True Recipient: Satisfying God's Law & Justice (12 min)

- **The Need:** God's Law is holy, just, and good (Rom 7:12). It reflects His
  character. Sin is transgression of the Law (1 John 3:4).
  - The penalty for transgression is death (Rom 6:23).
  - **(RQ)** If God is love, why couldn't He just forgive without a payment?
    (Because He is also just; His Law cannot be arbitrarily set aside without
    undermining the foundation of His government).
- **The Biblical Principle:** The ransom/sacrifice satisfied the claims of God's
  unchanging Law and Justice.
  - Read Romans 3:25-26 carefully.
    - Christ set forth as propitiation... to declare God's righteousness... that
      He might be **just**, AND the **justifier** of the one who has faith in
      Jesus.
    - [Whiteboard: Rom 3:26 - God is BOTH Just (upholds Law) AND Justifier
      (saves sinner)]
    - [Draw simple diagram: SIN -> Breaks LAW -> Requires JUSTICE (Death
      Penalty) -> CHRIST (Pays Penalty) -> Upholds LAW & Offers MERCY]
  - Christ's death met the moral necessity of the universe – upholding justice
    while providing mercy.
  - It vindicated God's character against Satan's accusations (that God was
    unfair, His law arbitrary).
- **Bridging to Practice:** Understanding this elevates our view of God's Law
  and the seriousness of sin.
  - [Metaphor: Like a government upholding its constitution even while offering
    pardon through a specific legal means.]
  - EGW Insight: Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as
    He deserves (DA 25 - paraphrase concept).
    - He took our legal standing under the broken Law.

### Section 4: The Result & Our Response (8 min)

- **The Result:** The way is now open!
  - Forgiveness, cleansing, amnesty, peace are available (1 John 1:9; Eph 1:7).
  - Reconciliation with God is possible (2 Cor 5:18-19).
  - Access to God restored (Heb 10:19-22).
  - [Whiteboard: RESULT = Forgiveness, Reconciliation, Access (Eph 1:7)]
- **The Need (Our Side):** Understanding the cost motivates our response.
  - Seeing the Law upheld shows the depth of our sin.
  - Seeing God's love and Christ's voluntary sacrifice inspires gratitude and
    repentance.
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from understanding the transaction):**
  1.  **Acknowledge the Justice:** Recognize sin's seriousness as a violation of
      God's holy Law (based on Rom 3:23, 7:12).
  2.  **Embrace the Mercy:** Accept the pardon freely offered through Christ's
      satisfaction of the Law's claims (based on Rom 3:24-26).
  3.  **Respond with Contrition & Confession:** Turn from sin and confess,
      trusting in His faithfulness (1 John 1:9).
- **[Aside:** _"Sometimes we treat God's forgiveness lightly, like a 'get out of
  jail free' card. But understanding that Christ's death satisfied the infinite
  claims of the Law helps us see the immense cost. It wasn't just waving away
  the rules; it was perfectly fulfilling them on our behalf."_]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: The ransom wasn't paid to Satan or to appease personal anger, but to
  satisfy the righteous demands of God's eternal Law, demonstrating both His
  justice and His love.
- Christ upheld the Law we broke, paying the penalty we deserved (Rom 3:25-26).
- The cross reveals the depth of sin and the height of God's love.
- **Invitation:** Have you understood the cost? Have you accepted the pardon
  secured by Christ's upheld hands – hands that satisfied justice for you?
  - Don't neglect so great a salvation (Heb 2:3).
  - Choose today to accept the forgiveness made possible through the Ransom
    paid.
- Final Prayer
