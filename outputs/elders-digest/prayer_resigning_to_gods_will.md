**(Time Allocation: 45 Minutes)**

### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: What's the most challenging part of prayer? Is it asking, waiting, or
  something else?
- Introduce Theme: True prayer, as taught by Jesus, involves profound
  resignation – aligning our desires with God's perfect will.
- Central Verse Focus: Matthew 6:10b. What does this familiar phrase truly ask
  for?
- Goal: To explore what it means to pray "Thy will be done" and how this
  resignation transforms our lives.

### Section 1: Prayer as Resignation (8 min)

- Defining Resignation: Not passive defeat, but active surrender to a higher,
  loving wisdom.
- The Lord's Prayer Context (Matt 6:9-13): This petition is central, linking
  God's name and kingdom to His will being done.
- Jesus' Ultimate Example: Gethsemane (Luke 22:42). The struggle and the
  surrender. [Whiteboard: Prayer = Resignation (Luke 22:42) -> "Not my will, but
  Thine"]
- Why is this surrender necessary? **(RQ)** Because our will is naturally bent
  away from God (Jer 17:9).
- This prayer acknowledges God's sovereignty and goodness.

### Section 2: Understanding God's Will: Decree vs. Desire [*] (8 min)

- Two Aspects of God's Will:
  - **Will of Decree:** God's sovereign, determined plans that _will_ be
    accomplished. [Whiteboard: God's Will: 1. Decree (Unchanging Purpose)]
    - Examples: Plan of Salvation, ultimate end of sin, Christ's return.
    - Scripture: Isaiah 14:24 ("The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as
      I have thought, so shall it come to pass..."), Eph 1:9-11 (His eternal
      purpose in Christ).
    - Confidence: This will _cannot_ be thwarted (Rom 8:28).
  - **Will of Desire:** What God desires or commands, reflecting His character,
    but allows human free will to resist. [Whiteboard: God's Will: 2. Desire
    (Commands/Wishes - Invites Cooperation)]
    - Examples: That all repent (2 Pet 3:9), that we obey His commands (Deut
      5:29).
    - This aspect _can_ be resisted on earth due to sin.
- Praying "Thy will be done" relates to both: Affirming trust in His
  unchangeable plan (Decree) and asking for alignment with His commands and
  character (Desire), starting with ourselves.
- How does knowing God's ultimate plan (Decree) give us hope even when His
  desires seem ignored? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: Heaven's Standard vs. Earth's Reality (10 min)

- The Heavenly Benchmark: How is God's will done _in heaven_? (Ps 103:20 -
  "Bless the Lord, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
  commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.")
  - [Whiteboard: Heaven's Obedience (Ps 103:20): Complete, Consistent, Constant,
    Without Complaint, Quick, Joyful, Loving]
- The Earthly Contrast: Why is earth different? Sin, rebellion, self-will (Isa
  53:6).
- The Prayer's Scope: We are asking for heavenly conditions to be replicated
  _here_, starting in our own hearts and lives.
- [Aside: Imagine a workplace where everyone instantly, joyfully did the boss's
  perfect will. That's a glimpse of heaven's harmony, the standard we pray for
  on earth.]
- This isn't just about future hope, but present transformation. How can my life
  reflect heaven's standard today? **(RQ)**

### Section 4: Praying for Alignment: Our Need (8 min)

- Recognizing Our Inability: We cannot align ourselves with God's will on our
  own.
- Praying for Divine Enablement:
  - **Spiritual Wisdom to Know His Will:** Ps 119:27 ("Make me to understand the
    way of thy precepts..."), Ps 119:33 ("Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy
    statutes..."). [Whiteboard: Need #1: Wisdom (Ps 119:27, 33) -> Study His
    Word]
  - **Spiritual Desire to Do His Will:** Ps 119:32 ("I will run the way of thy
    commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart."), Ps 119:36 ("Incline my
    heart unto thy testimonies..."). [Whiteboard: Need #2: Desire (Ps 119:32,
    36) -> Pray for Changed Heart]
  - **Spiritual Strength to Carry Out His Will:** Ps 119:25 ("My soul cleaveth
    unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word."), Ps 119:28 ("My soul
    melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word."); Phil
    2:13 ("For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good
    pleasure."); Heb 13:20-21 ("...make you perfect in every good work to do his
    will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight...").
    [Whiteboard: Need #3: Strength (Phil 2:13, Heb 13:21) -> Rely on His Power]
- The Foundation: Presenting Ourselves (Rom 12:1-2). This act of surrender opens
  the door for God's transforming work and our ability to discern His will.
  [Analogy (from Phil 2:13): Like plugging into God's power source – surrender
  connects us.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Summary: Praying "Thy will be done" is the essence of resigned faith. It
  acknowledges God's perfect sovereignty (Decree) and seeks alignment with His
  character and commands (Desire), mirroring heaven on earth.
- The Blessings of Submission:
  - Honors the Father (John 5:30)
  - Hallows His Name (Matt 6:9)
  - Advances His Kingdom (within us first - Luke 17:21)
- Trusting His Providence: EGW Quote: "Pray in faith, and the mystery of His
  providence will bring its answer." (Prayer, p. 59). Resignation trusts His
  unseen hand.
- Practical Takeaway: This prayer transforms _us_. It shifts focus from our
  agenda to God's.
- Appeal: Are you willing to truly pray this prayer today? To offer yourself as
  a living sacrifice (Rom 12:1)? To seek His wisdom, desire His ways, and rely
  on His strength?
- Invitation: Let's commit to making "Thy will be done" the sincere posture of
  our hearts before God.
