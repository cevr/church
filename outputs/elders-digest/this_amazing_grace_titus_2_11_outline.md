### Introduction (6 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce Titus 2:11 - Grace has *appeared*. What does this mean? **(RQ)**
- Common understanding vs. Biblical depth of 'grace'.
- Goal: Explore the *teaching* power of grace as revealed in Scripture.
- [Whiteboard: Title - "This Amazing Grace: More Than Pardon"] 
- [Whiteboard: Central Verse - Titus 2:11-12]

### Section 1: What Grace Is (And Isn't) (10 min)
- **Grace Defined: God's Riches At Christ's Expense**
    - **Unmerited Favor:** Ephesians 2:8-9 - Salvation is a *gift* through faith, not earned.
        - [Whiteboard: GRACE (Eph 2:8) = GIFT, not Wages]
        - Contrast with works-based salvation attempts. **(RQ)** How often do we subtly try to earn God's favor even after accepting Christ?
    - **Not By Works:** Romans 11:6 - Grace and works are mutually exclusive for justification.
        - If salvation depends *at all* on our works, it ceases to be grace. [Explain simply]
    - **Uninherited:** Ephesians 2:3 - We are *by nature* children of wrath. Grace comes from outside us.
        - No one is born a Christian; grace must be received personally.
    - **Can Be Discredited/Frustrated:** Galatians 2:21 - Trying to be justified by law nullifies grace.
        - [Whiteboard: Gal 2:21 - Law-keeping for justification = Frustrating Grace]
        - **(RQ)** How might we unintentionally 'frustrate' the grace of God today?

### Section 2: The Multifaceted Work of Grace [*] (10 min)
- **Grace Does More Than Pardon:**
    - **Justifies:** Romans 3:24 - Declared righteous freely through Christ's redemption.
        - [Whiteboard: Justification (Rom 3:24) = Declared Righteous (Legal Standing)]
        - This is the foundation, not the whole building.
    - **Delivers/Saves:** Acts 15:11 - Saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
        - Grace rescues us from sin's penalty *and* power.
    - **Forgives:** Ephesians 1:7 - Redemption and forgiveness according to the *riches* of His grace.
        - [Analogy (from Eph 1:7): God's forgiveness isn't meager; it's lavish, drawn from infinite riches.]
    - **Enriches:** Philippians 4:19 - God supplies all our *needs* according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus (context of giving/receiving points to God's gracious provision).
        - Grace isn't just spiritual; it impacts our entire being and needs.
    - **Empowers:** 2 Timothy 2:1 - Be strong *in the grace* that is in Christ Jesus.
        - [Whiteboard: Empowerment (2 Tim 2:1) = Strength *IN* Grace]
        - Grace isn't passive; it's divine power enabling us. **(RQ)** How do we access this strength daily?

### Section 3: Receiving & Living Grace (12 min)
- **How Do We Access This Grace?**
    - **Look:** Isaiah 45:22 - "Look unto me, and be ye saved..."
        - Focus must shift from self/sin to Christ.
        - [Whiteboard: RECEIVE GRACE -> LOOK (Isa 45:22)]
    - **Call:** Romans 10:12-13 - Lord is rich unto all that call upon Him.
        - Active seeking, acknowledging need.
        - [Whiteboard: RECEIVE GRACE -> CALL (Rom 10:12)]
    - **Come:** Isaiah 55:1 - "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters..."
        - Invitation to partake freely.
        - [Whiteboard: RECEIVE GRACE -> COME (Isa 55:1)]
- **The Transformative Purpose of Grace (Titus 2:11-12)**
    - Grace *Teaches Us*: It's not just a status; it's an active instructor.
        - [Whiteboard: Titus 2:12 - Grace TEACHES]
        - **(RQ)** What is grace teaching *you* this week?
    - **Teaches Denial:** Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts.
        - Grace provides the *reason* and the *power* to say no.
        - [Aside: Like spiritual antibodies, grace helps us fight off the infections of sin and worldliness that constantly surround us.]
    - **Teaches Living:** Soberly (self-controlled), Righteously (right conduct towards others), Godly (right conduct towards God) *in this present world*.
        - [Whiteboard: Grace Teaches -> Deny Sin -> Live Soberly, Righteously, Godly]
        - This is practical, daily sanctification enabled by grace.
        - Connects to obedience to God's Law as the *fruit* of grace, not the root. (Ref Rom 6:14-15)
    - **End-Time Relevance:** This grace-empowered living prepares a people to reflect Christ's character fully (Final Generation Theology context).
        - [Illustration Concept (Biblical Narrative): Joseph resisting Potiphar's wife (Gen 39) - an example of grace empowering denial and righteous living under pressure.]
        - [Aside: Preparing for Christ's return isn't about frantic activity, but about allowing His grace to thoroughly transform our character day by day, making us safe to save, fit for heaven's society.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (7 min)
- Recap: Grace is unmerited, multifaceted (justifies, empowers, *teaches*), and received by looking, calling, coming.
- Re-emphasize Titus 2:11-12: Grace isn't cheap; it cost Christ everything. It's not passive; it actively *teaches* and *transforms*.
- **(RQ)** Are we experiencing grace merely as pardon, or as the transforming power Titus describes?
- The Need: A world needing to see the *result* of grace â€“ lives changed, reflecting God's character.
- Invitation:
    - To *receive* grace fully if you haven't (Look, Call, Come).
    - To *yield* to the teaching ministry of grace daily (Deny, Live soberly, righteously, godly).
    - Commit to letting grace empower obedience and character transformation this week.
