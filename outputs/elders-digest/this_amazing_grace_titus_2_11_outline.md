### Introduction (6 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce Titus 2:11 - Grace has _appeared_. What does this mean? **(RQ)**
- Common understanding vs. Biblical depth of 'grace'.
- Goal: Explore the _teaching_ power of grace as revealed in Scripture.
- [Whiteboard: Title - "This Amazing Grace: More Than Pardon"]
- [Whiteboard: Central Verse - Titus 2:11-12]

### Section 1: What Grace Is (And Isn't) (10 min)

- **Grace Defined: God's Riches At Christ's Expense**
  - **Unmerited Favor:** Ephesians 2:8-9 - Salvation is a _gift_ through faith,
    not earned.
    - [Whiteboard: GRACE (Eph 2:8) = GIFT, not Wages]
    - Contrast with works-based salvation attempts. **(RQ)** How often do we
      subtly try to earn God's favor even after accepting Christ?
  - **Not By Works:** Romans 11:6 - Grace and works are mutually exclusive for
    justification.
    - If salvation depends _at all_ on our works, it ceases to be grace.
      [Explain simply]
  - **Uninherited:** Ephesians 2:3 - We are _by nature_ children of wrath. Grace
    comes from outside us.
    - No one is born a Christian; grace must be received personally.
  - **Can Be Discredited/Frustrated:** Galatians 2:21 - Trying to be justified
    by law nullifies grace.
    - [Whiteboard: Gal 2:21 - Law-keeping for justification = Frustrating Grace]
    - **(RQ)** How might we unintentionally 'frustrate' the grace of God today?

### Section 2: The Multifaceted Work of Grace [*] (10 min)

- **Grace Does More Than Pardon:**
  - **Justifies:** Romans 3:24 - Declared righteous freely through Christ's
    redemption.
    - [Whiteboard: Justification (Rom 3:24) = Declared Righteous (Legal
      Standing)]
    - This is the foundation, not the whole building.
  - **Delivers/Saves:** Acts 15:11 - Saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus
    Christ.
    - Grace rescues us from sin's penalty _and_ power.
  - **Forgives:** Ephesians 1:7 - Redemption and forgiveness according to the
    _riches_ of His grace.
    - [Analogy (from Eph 1:7): God's forgiveness isn't meager; it's lavish,
      drawn from infinite riches.]
  - **Enriches:** Philippians 4:19 - God supplies all our _needs_ according to
    His riches in glory by Christ Jesus (context of giving/receiving points to
    God's gracious provision).
    - Grace isn't just spiritual; it impacts our entire being and needs.
  - **Empowers:** 2 Timothy 2:1 - Be strong _in the grace_ that is in Christ
    Jesus.
    - [Whiteboard: Empowerment (2 Tim 2:1) = Strength *IN* Grace]
    - Grace isn't passive; it's divine power enabling us. **(RQ)** How do we
      access this strength daily?

### Section 3: Receiving & Living Grace (12 min)

- **How Do We Access This Grace?**
  - **Look:** Isaiah 45:22 - "Look unto me, and be ye saved..."
    - Focus must shift from self/sin to Christ.
    - [Whiteboard: RECEIVE GRACE -> LOOK (Isa 45:22)]
  - **Call:** Romans 10:12-13 - Lord is rich unto all that call upon Him.
    - Active seeking, acknowledging need.
    - [Whiteboard: RECEIVE GRACE -> CALL (Rom 10:12)]
  - **Come:** Isaiah 55:1 - "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
    waters..."
    - Invitation to partake freely.
    - [Whiteboard: RECEIVE GRACE -> COME (Isa 55:1)]
- **The Transformative Purpose of Grace (Titus 2:11-12)**
  - Grace _Teaches Us_: It's not just a status; it's an active instructor.
    - [Whiteboard: Titus 2:12 - Grace TEACHES]
    - **(RQ)** What is grace teaching _you_ this week?
  - **Teaches Denial:** Denying ungodliness and worldly lusts.
    - Grace provides the _reason_ and the _power_ to say no.
    - [Aside: Like spiritual antibodies, grace helps us fight off the infections
      of sin and worldliness that constantly surround us.]
  - **Teaches Living:** Soberly (self-controlled), Righteously (right conduct
    towards others), Godly (right conduct towards God) _in this present world_.
    - [Whiteboard: Grace Teaches -> Deny Sin -> Live Soberly, Righteously,
      Godly]
    - This is practical, daily sanctification enabled by grace.
    - Connects to obedience to God's Law as the _fruit_ of grace, not the root.
      (Ref Rom 6:14-15)
  - **End-Time Relevance:** This grace-empowered living prepares a people to
    reflect Christ's character fully (Final Generation Theology context).
    - [Illustration Concept (Biblical Narrative): Joseph resisting Potiphar's
      wife (Gen 39) - an example of grace empowering denial and righteous living
      under pressure.]
    - [Aside: Preparing for Christ's return isn't about frantic activity, but
      about allowing His grace to thoroughly transform our character day by day,
      making us safe to save, fit for heaven's society.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (7 min)

- Recap: Grace is unmerited, multifaceted (justifies, empowers, _teaches_), and
  received by looking, calling, coming.
- Re-emphasize Titus 2:11-12: Grace isn't cheap; it cost Christ everything. It's
  not passive; it actively _teaches_ and _transforms_.
- **(RQ)** Are we experiencing grace merely as pardon, or as the transforming
  power Titus describes?
- The Need: A world needing to see the _result_ of grace â€“ lives changed,
  reflecting God's character.
- Invitation:
  - To _receive_ grace fully if you haven't (Look, Call, Come).
  - To _yield_ to the teaching ministry of grace daily (Deny, Live soberly,
    righteously, godly).
  - Commit to letting grace empower obedience and character transformation this
    week.
- Final Prayer
