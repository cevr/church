### Introduction (5 min)
- **Hook:** Start with the concept of ancient Israel's unique role. What did it mean for them to be God's chosen people? **(RQ)**
- **Bridge:** Introduce the idea that this calling wasn't lost but transferred and expanded through Christ.
- **Central Text:** Introduce 1 Peter 2:9 as the foundation for understanding our identity as believers.
    - `[Write on board: 1 Peter 2:9 - Chosen, Royal Priesthood, Holy Nation, Peculiar People]`
- **Outline Preview:** Briefly state the key aspects of this identity we will explore based on Scripture.

### Main Content Section 1: The New Israel & Royal Priesthood (10 min)
- **God's Original Plan:**
    - Briefly examine Exodus 19:5-6. God desired a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.
    - `[Whiteboard: Ex 19:5-6 -> Kingdom of Priests, Holy Nation]`
    - Note Israel's conditional acceptance ("If ye will obey...").
- **The Transfer to Spiritual Israel:**
    - Read Galatians 3:28-29. How do we become Abraham's seed and heirs? **(RQ)**
    - Explain that through faith in Christ, believers of all backgrounds constitute the 'new Israel'.
    - `[Whiteboard: Gal 3:28-29 -> In Christ = Abraham's Seed = New Israel]`
- **Royal Priesthood Explained:**
    - What did priests do? (Represent God to people, people to God - intercession, sacrifice, teaching).
    - Read Hebrews 4:14-16. How does Christ as High Priest change our access? **(RQ)**
    - `[Whiteboard: Heb 4:14-16 -> Bold Access via Christ]`
    - Explain 'Royal Priesthood' (1 Pet 2:9): Direct access to God through Jesus, no earthly intermediary needed.
    - Our Priestly Duties: Offering spiritual sacrifices (praise - Heb 13:15), intercession (prayer for others - 1 Tim 2:1), witnessing (representing God).
    - `[Write Question: How are we fulfilling our priestly duties daily?]`

### Main Content Section 2: Holy Nation & Peculiar People [*] (12 min)
- **Called to be a Holy Nation:**
    - Define 'holy' (set apart for God's purpose, morally pure).
    - Read Romans 12:1-2. What does separation from the world look like? **(RQ)**
    - `[Whiteboard: Rom 12:1-2 -> Holy Sacrifice, Not Conformed, Transformed Mind]`
    - Contrast: Worldly values vs. Kingdom values (e.g., self-seeking vs. service, temporary pleasure vs. eternal focus).
    - This separation isn't isolation, but distinctiveness in character, purpose, and practice.
    - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]`
- **God's Peculiar People:**
    - Explain 'peculiar' (KJV) = special treasure, valued possession (Ex 19:5, Deut 7:6).
    - Read Titus 2:11-14. What does God's grace teach us? How are we purified? **(RQ)**
    - `[Whiteboard: Titus 2:11-14 -> Grace Teaches Godliness -> Peculiar People -> Zealous for Good Works]`
    - We are purchased by Christ's blood (1 Cor 6:20), belonging wholly to Him.
    - This high value placed on us motivates holy living.

### Main Content Section 3: Living the Calling - Showing Forth Praises (12 min)
- **The Purpose: Showing Forth Praises:**
    - Revisit 1 Peter 2:9b. Our identity leads to a mission: demonstrating God's virtues/character.
    - `[Whiteboard: 1 Pet 2:9b -> Show Forth Praises = Demonstrate God's Character]`
    - How do we do this? By reflecting the transformation from darkness (sin, ignorance) to light (truth, righteousness).
    - Read Ephesians 5:8. What does it mean to 'walk as children of light'? **(RQ)**
    - `[Analogy (from Eph 5:8): Like turning on a light in a dark room - our lives should illuminate God's goodness.]`
- **Practical Demonstration:**
    - Distinct Habits: Prayer, Bible study, Sabbath observance, healthy living.
    - Distinct Aspirations: Seeking God's kingdom first (Matt 6:33), desiring Christlikeness.
    - Distinct Actions: Honesty, integrity, compassion, service, forgiveness, sharing faith.
    - `[Whiteboard: Action Steps -> Prayer (Intercession), Purity (Choices), Proclamation (Witness)]`
- **Ellen G. White Emphasis:**
    - Underscore the need for distinctiveness and holiness, especially for the remnant.
    - Quote concept: *"God requires His people now to be a peculiar people, distinct from the world. ... Their work is to serve God fully, heartily, without reserving anything."* (Based on Testimony Treasures 1:264)
    - Quote concept: *"Every sin cherished weakens the character and strengthens habit; and physical, mental, and moral disease is the result. ... We dishonor God when we sin against Him."* (Based on Testimony Treasures 3:286)
    - `[Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed.]`
