### Introduction (5 min)

*   **Hook:** Start with a relatable scenario of feeling judged or falling short.
*   **Introduce Topic:** Today we explore the core Christian truth: Jesus as our *only* Savior from sin.
*   **Central Verse:** Read Romans 5:8. Emphasize God's proactive love.
*   **Outline Preview:** Briefly state the study's flow: Our need, God's compassionate intervention, His provision for salvation, and the resulting new life.
*   `[Write on board: Jesus Our Savior (Rom 5:8)]`

### Section 1: The Universal Reality of Sin & Guilt (10 min)

*   **The Problem Defined:** Sin isn't just 'bad deeds'; it's falling short of God's standard.
    *   Romans 3:10 - "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
    *   Romans 3:23 - "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
    *   `[Write on board: SIN = Falling Short (Rom 3:23)]`
    *   `(RQ)` Does 'all' really mean *all*? How does this level the playing field before God?
*   **The Law's Purpose & Consequence:** God's law reveals sin and our universal guilt.
    *   James 2:10 - "For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."
    *   `[Whiteboard: Law -> Reveals Sin -> Shows Guilt (James 2:10)]`
    *   Contextual Point: The law demanded consequences (Ref. Lev 20:10 - adultery example shows severity).
    *   `(RQ)` If breaking one commandment makes us guilty of all, what hope does the law itself offer for salvation?

### Section 2: Confronting Sin: Human Judgment vs. Divine Compassion [*] (10 min)

*   **Human Tendency:** We often condemn others while ignoring our own faults.
    *   Reference the spirit of the accusers in John 8 (Context for DA 461).
    *   Jesus exposes hypocrisy (Ref. EGW, DA 461 - focus on Christ's method).
    *   `[Whiteboard: Human Judgment (Hypocrisy) vs. Divine Insight (Truth)]`
*   **Christ's Response:** Jesus doesn't ignore sin, but offers a path beyond condemnation.
    *   He showed compassion to the repentant woman (John 8:10-11).
    *   He offered forgiveness, not accusation.
    *   `(RQ)` How did Jesus balance acknowledging the sin ('Go, and sin no more') with offering forgiveness ('Neither do I condemn thee')? (John 8:11)
*   `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies...]` Our interactions should reflect Heaven's approach—truth spoken in love, offering restoration, not just condemnation. We represent a kingdom of grace.

### Section 3: God's Provision: Salvation Through Faith in Christ (10 min)

*   **The Core Solution:** God didn't leave us condemned; He provided a Savior.
    *   Revisit Romans 5:8 - God acted *first*, demonstrating love despite our sin.
    *   `[Draw arrow: Our Sin (Rom 3:23) -> God's Love (Rom 5:8) -> Christ's Death]`
*   **Receiving the Gift:** Salvation is accessed through faith, not works.
    *   Romans 10:9 - "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved."
    *   `[Write: Faith = Trust + Confession (Rom 10:9)]`
    *   `(RQ)` What does it mean to 'believe in thine heart' versus just intellectual agreement?
*   **Simplicity of the Gospel:** It's not complicated rules, but trusting Christ's finished work.
    *   `(RQ)` Have we sometimes made salvation seem more complex than Romans 10:9 suggests?

### Section 4: The Result: Transformation and Freedom (10 min)

*   **A New Identity:** Faith in Christ brings radical change.
    *   2 Corinthians 5:17 - "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new."
    *   `[Whiteboard: Old Self (Condemned) -> In Christ -> New Creation (2 Cor 5:17)]`
    *   `[Metaphor (from 2 Cor 5:17): Like a legal pardon AND a new citizenship - status changed, potential transformed.]`
*   **From Death to Life:** Understanding our past state highlights the magnitude of grace.
    *   Ephesians 2:1-3 - Describes life before Christ: dead in sins, following the world, objects of wrath.
    *   `(RQ)` Reading Ephesians 2:1-3, how does this contrast with the 'new creation' status in 2 Cor 5:17?
*   **Empowered Living:** This isn't just forgiveness *from* sin's penalty, but freedom *from* its power.
    *   The new life empowers change and obedience out of love, not fear.
    *   `[Whiteboard: Action Steps (Based on Eph 2 & 2 Cor 5:17): 1. Recognize old patterns (Eph 2). 2. Embrace new identity in Christ daily. 3. Live out the 'new things' (love, service, obedience). ]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

*   **Summary:** We were all lost in sin (Rom 3:23), facing condemnation (James 2:10). But God, in love (Rom 5:8), sent Jesus. He offers forgiveness instead of condemnation (John 8 context) and salvation through faith (Rom 10:9). This results in a completely new life (2 Cor 5:17), freed from our past (Eph 2:1-3).
*   **The Simple Truth:** Jesus is our *only* hope and Savior.
*   **Invitation:**
    *   For those who haven't: Will you accept His offer today? Confess and believe (Rom 10:9).
    *   For believers: Are you living fully in the reality of being a 'new creation'? (2 Cor 5:17) Recommit to walking in that freedom.
*   **Closing Prayer Prompt:** Pray for hearts to grasp the depth of God's love and the reality of salvation in Jesus, and for strength to live as new creations.
