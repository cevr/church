### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Universal desire for healing (physical, spiritual, emotional).
- The Setting: Pool of Bethesda (John 5:2-4) - Hope mixed with superstition.
  - Contrast: Human methods vs. Divine power.
    `[Reference Desire of Ages, p. 201: True healing comes from Christ, not superstition]`
- Purpose: Explore steps to true, lasting healing found in John 5.
- Central Question: Introduce John 5:6.
  `[Write on board: John 5:6 - "Do you want to be made well?"]`

### Section 1: The Encounter & The Crucial Question (10 min)

- **The Scene of Waiting:** (John 5:2-5)
  - Bethesda: "House of Mercy/Flowing Water".
    `[Whiteboard: Bethesda = Place of Waiting]`
  - Multitudes waiting, superstition (v. 3b-4, KJV note). Human helplessness.
  - Focus on one man: 38 years infirm (John 5:5). Symbol of long-held weakness,
    hopelessness.
- **Jesus Seeks Him Out:** (John 5:6a)
  - Divine initiative. Jesus _knew_ his long condition.
  - God sees individuals amidst the crowd, knows our deepest needs.
- **The Question of Desire:** (John 5:6b)
  - "Do you _want_ to be made well?" Why ask the obvious? **(RQ)**
  - Reveals the man's mindset: Focused on limitations, blame, external solutions
    (John 5:7).
    `[Whiteboard: Man's Focus: Blame/Excuses (v.7) vs. Christ's Offer (v.6)]`
  - Crucial point: Personal desire for change is essential for receiving God's
    help. God respects our will.
  - Application: Are we comfortable in our 'infirmities' (habits, excuses)?
    **(RQ)** Do we truly _want_ God's transformation, or just relief from
    symptoms? Clinging to helplessness hinders growth.

### Section 2: The Command, The Power, The Obedience [*] (12 min)

- **The Unexpected Command:** (John 5:8)
  - "Rise, take up your bed, and walk." - Simple, direct, authoritative.
  - No ritual, no water. Contrasts sharply with expected methods.
  - Demonstrates Christ's inherent divine power to heal and transform.
    `[Write on board: Jesus' Word (v.8) = Creative Power]`
- **Immediate Healing & Active Response:** (John 5:9a)
  - "And immediately the man was made well..." Healing tied to the Word.
  - "...took up his bed, and walked." Required active obedience. Faith acted
    upon the command.
  - Moving beyond past limitations: He had to _do_ what was previously
    impossible.
  - Application: Responding to Christ involves active obedience. We must 'get
    up' from spiritual lethargy and 'walk' in newness of life.
    `[Analogy: Faith like a muscle - grows when exercised by obedience to God's Word.]`
    What 'mats' of past failures or limitations do we need to leave behind?
    **(RQ)**
- **The Timing:** "And that day was the Sabbath." (John 5:9b). Foreshadows
  conflict.

### Section 3: Controversy, Consequence & True Worship (12 min)

- **Man-Made Rules vs. Divine Mercy:** (John 5:10-13)
  - Religious leaders confront the healed man: "It is the Sabbath; it is not
    lawful..." (John 5:10). Focus on rigid rules over human restoration.
  - Man's initial ignorance/defense: Points to the Healer's authority (John
    5:11). Doesn't yet know Jesus (v. 13).
- **Jesus Finds Him Again - The Deeper Lesson:** (John 5:14)
  - Jesus seeks him post-healing. Concern for spiritual well-being.
  - The Warning: "See, you have been made well. Sin no more, lest a worse thing
    come upon you."
    `[Write on board: Healing -> Responsibility -> Sin No More (v.14)]`
  - Highlights potential link between sin and suffering. Forsaking sin is
    essential for _complete_ restoration and avoiding relapse/worse
    consequences.
  - Grace empowers obedience, doesn't excuse sin.
  - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Similarly, our lives, healed by Christ, should witness to His transforming power, not conform back to sinful patterns.]`
- **The Heart of the Sabbath:** (John 5:16-18)
  - Jesus defends His actions: "My Father has been working until now, and I
    work." (John 5:17).
    `[Whiteboard: Sabbath = God's Work of Mercy & Restoration (v.17)]`
  - Sabbath purpose: Mercy, healing, restoration - reflecting God's character,
    not just inactivity.
  - Jesus prioritized true worship and mercy over rigid, man-made
    interpretations.
  - The Real Issue: His claim to equality with God (John 5:18). This challenges
    their entire system.
  - Application: Do our religious observances reflect God's heart of mercy, or
    just external compliance? **(RQ)** How can we make the Sabbath a delight
    through acts of love and restoration?

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Jesus seeks us (initiative), questions our desire (will), commands
  action (obedience), provides power (healing), requires change (forsake sin),
  and reveals true worship (mercy over ritual).
- **The Invitation:** The question remains for us: "Do you want to be made
  well?" (John 5:6).
  - Are you waiting by a 'pool' of human solutions or past failures?
  - Are you willing to hear His command, obey in faith, and leave sin behind?
- **The Call to Action:**
  1.  Acknowledge your need and _truly desire_ God's transformation.
  2.  Listen for His specific word/command to you through Scripture.
  3.  Step out in faith - Rise, take action, walk in obedience.
  4.  Commit to turning from known sin, empowered by His grace (John 5:14).
- Final Thought: Don't let helplessness, excuses, or fear of opposition keep you
  from the complete healing Jesus offers. He has the power. Trust and obey.
- Prayer for willingness and obedient faith.
