### Introduction (6 min)

- Start with universal need: Hunger. Physical hunger vs. deeper spiritual
  hunger.
- Introduce the setting: After feeding 5000 (John 6:1-14), crowd seeks Jesus for
  more physical bread (John 6:26).
- Jesus redirects: Introduces a different kind of bread.
- State Central Theme: Jesus Himself _is_ the Bread of Life, the only source of
  true spiritual satisfaction and eternal life.
- Read Central Verse: John 6:35.
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & John 6:35]
- Purpose: To understand what it means for Jesus to be the Bread of Life and how
  to partake of Him.

### Section 1: The True Bread vs. Temporary Fixes (10 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Why seek temporary solutions for eternal needs? (RQ)
- **Biblical Principle:** Contrast perishable food with eternal sustenance.
  - John 6:27 - Don't labor _only_ for physical food. Seek the food Jesus gives
    â€“ eternal life.
  - [Whiteboard: Perishable Meat (Worldly things, temporary fixes) vs. Enduring
    Meat (Jesus, eternal life) - John 6:27]
  - Contrast with Manna (John 6:31-32, 49): Ancestors ate manna (God-given!) yet
    died. It sustained physically, not eternally.
  - Jesus is the _true_ bread from heaven (John 6:32-33).
- **Bridging to Practice:** We often chase temporary satisfaction (possessions,
  status, entertainment). (RQ) How does this mirror the crowd seeking loaves?
  - [Analogy: Drinking saltwater quenches thirst momentarily but leads to
    greater dehydration/death. Worldly 'bread' is similar.]
- **Key Point:** Jesus Himself, not a religious system, ritual, or philosophy,
  is the Bread. It's a Person we need.
  - John 6:48 - "I _am_ that bread of life."
  - [Whiteboard: Jesus = The Bread (John 6:48)]

### Section 2: Partaking by Faith for Eternal Life [*] (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** How do we receive this Bread of Life?
- **Biblical Principle:** Eating/Drinking = Believing/Receiving Jesus by faith.
  - John 6:47 - "He that _believeth_ on me hath everlasting life."
  - Connect belief (v. 47) with being the Bread (v. 48).
  - John 6:51 - Eating this living bread leads to eternal life. The bread is His
    flesh, given for the world.
  - John 6:53-54 - Strong language: Eating flesh/drinking blood = essential for
    life. This shocked listeners (John 6:60-61, 66).
  - Clarification: Not literal cannibalism. Jesus explains in John 6:63 - "It is
    the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I
    speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life."
  - [Whiteboard: Eat/Drink (v53-54) = Believe/Receive His Word/Sacrifice by
    Faith (v35, v40, v47, v63)]
  - [RQ: How does understanding 'eating' as 'believing/internalizing His word
    and sacrifice' change our approach to faith?]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Partaking isn't a one-time event, but a continuous
  receiving of Christ through His Word and Spirit.
  - [Aside: Just as we need daily physical food, our souls need daily communion
    with Christ, the Bread of Life. Neglecting this leads to spiritual weakness
    and starvation, even if we look outwardly 'fed' by religious activity.]
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  - 1. Consciously accept Jesus' sacrifice daily (1 Cor 15:31 - I die daily).
       Reflect on His 'flesh given for the life of the world' (John 6:51).
  - 2. Feed on His Word daily (Matt 4:4) - internalize His teachings ('the
       words... are spirit, and they are life' - John 6:63).
  - 3. Pray for the Holy Spirit to make this real ('It is the spirit that
       quickeneth' - John 6:63).

### Section 3: Sufficiency, Security, and Sharing (11 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Is Jesus enough? Can we lose this life He gives?
- **Biblical Principle 1: Complete Sufficiency.**
  - John 6:35b - "he that cometh to me shall _never hunger_; and he that
    believeth on me shall _never thirst_."
  - Jesus meets the deepest needs completely and permanently.
  - [Whiteboard: Jesus = Complete Satisfaction (John 6:35b)]
  - [Metaphor: Worldly 'food' is like spiritual junk food - fills temporarily,
    offers no real nourishment. Jesus is the essential, life-giving staple.]
- **Biblical Principle 2: Eternal Security in Christ.**
  - John 6:37 - "him that cometh to me I will _in no wise cast out_."
  - John 6:39 - The Father's will: Jesus loses none given to Him, raises them
    up.
  - Security is found _in coming to and remaining in_ Christ (John 15:4 - Abide
    in Me).
  - [Whiteboard: Security IN CHRIST (John 6:37, 39)]
  - [RQ: How does John 6:37 counter fears about losing salvation?]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Living with the confidence that Christ is sufficient
  and holds us secure.
  - [Aside: Our churches should be places where people find this true Bread, not
    just religious formalities. Like spiritual embassies, they should offer the
    sustenance of heaven, demonstrating Christ's sufficiency and security to a
    starving world.]
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  - 1. When feeling spiritually hungry/thirsty, consciously turn _to Jesus_
       (Come to Me - v.35, 37), not substitutes.
  - 2. Rest in the promise of His acceptance and keeping power (John 6:37).
  - 3. Share the Bread: If Jesus is the _only_ source of eternal life, we have a
       responsibility to share Him (Matt 28:19-20). Offer the true Bread to
       others.
  - [Whiteboard: Action -> Come Daily (v35), Rest Securely (v37), Share Freely
    (Matt 28:19)]

  - The world offers temporary fixes (perishing meat).
