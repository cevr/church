### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Opening Hymn Introduction
- The Core Question: Is the Sabbath merely an ancient rule, a burden we must
  bear, or is it something profoundly more—a gift designed for our blessing?
  **(RQ)**
- Introduce Central Verse: Mark 2:27-28. Jesus' own words: Sabbath was _made
  for_ humanity.
  `[Write on board: Mark 2:27-28 - Made FOR Man, Not Man FOR Sabbath]`
- Outline Purpose: To explore, through Scripture, the Sabbath as God's
  intentional gift for rest, relationship-building with Him, finding solutions,
  and experiencing spiritual renewal.

### I. The Foundation: God's Original Gift (10 min)

- **A. Established in Eden (Genesis 2:2-3)**
  - Before sin, before Israel – a universal institution for all humanity.
    `[Write on board: Gen 2:2-3 - Universal Creation Ordinance]`
  - God _rested_, _blessed_, and _sanctified_ (set apart) the seventh day. Why
    these three actions? What does it mean for a day to be blessed and set apart
    by God Himself? **(RQ)**
  - A perpetual memorial of God's creative power and authority.
- **B. Enshrined in the Decalogue (Exodus 20:8-11)**
  - Command: "Remember" – Points back to its prior existence (Genesis).
    `[Write on board: Ex 20:8 - REMEMBER]`
  - The Reason Given: Explicitly links back to the six days of creation and
    God's rest on the seventh. `[Underline 'For in six days...' on board]`
  - A sign of allegiance: Acknowledging God as Creator and Lawgiver.
- **C. Clarified by Christ (Mark 2:27-28)**
  - Rebuking legalism: Jesus affirms the Sabbath's purpose is human well-being
    (physical, mental, spiritual). It's a gift, not a yoke.
  - "Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath": Christ defines its true meaning
    and observance, centered on relationship and mercy, not just rules.

### II. The Focus: Shifting from Martha to Mary (12 min) [*]

- **A. The Invitation to Shift Focus (Luke 10:38-42)**
  - Martha: Represents weekday concerns, anxieties, being "cumbered about much
    serving." `[Write on board: Martha = Worldly Cares (Luke 10:40)]`
  - Mary: Represents choosing the "good part" – sitting at Jesus' feet, focused
    communion. `[Write on board: Mary = Christ Focus (Luke 10:42)]`
  - Sabbath Principle: A deliberate choice to cease from our own works and
    worries (Martha) to focus wholly on Christ (Mary). How can we practically
    'choose the good part' when Sabbath begins? **(RQ)**
- **B. Celebrating God as Creator and Savior**
  - Remembering Creation Power (Ex 20:11). Connects us to our origins.
  - Remembering Redemptive Power (Deut 5:15 - Sabbath also a sign of deliverance
    from Egypt/sin). `[Write on board: Deut 5:15 - Sign of Redemption]`
  - Resting _in_ His completed work – both Creation and Salvation.
- **C. The Call to Worship the Creator (Revelation 14:7)**
  - First Angel's Message: An end-time call to "Fear God... give glory...
    worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea..."
    `[Write on board: Rev 14:7 - Worship the CREATOR]`
  - Sabbath observance directly answers this call, identifying the true God in
    contrast to false systems of worship. It's a mark of loyalty to the Creator.
  - [Aside: Our Sabbath gatherings are weekly declarations of allegiance to the
    Creator God in a world increasingly forgetting Him. They are embassies of
    His kingdom.]

### III. The Experience: A Delight and Blessing (12 min)

- **A. Finding Delight, Not Drudgery (Isaiah 58:13-14)**
  - God's Desire: That we call the Sabbath a "delight," the "holy of the Lord,
    honourable." `[Write on board: Isa 58:13 - A DELIGHT]`
  - The Condition: Turning from our own ways, pleasures, and words _to focus on
    Him_. What does 'not speaking thine own words' mean in practice on Sabbath?
    **(RQ)**
  - The Promise: True joy, spiritual elevation ("ride upon the high places"),
    and inheritance found in honoring God's day.
- **B. Spiritual Renewal and Introspection**
  - Time for focused prayer, meditation on Scripture (Psalm 119:97), reflection
    on God's character and works (Psalm 92:4-5).
  - Seeking spiritual solutions and drawing closer to God, away from weekday
    noise.
  - [Analogy: Sabbath as a spiritual 'oasis' in the desert of the week,
    providing essential refreshment and perspective.]
- **C. Humanitarian Aspect: Doing Good (Matthew 12:11-12)**
  - Jesus' Example: Healing and acts of mercy are appropriate and encouraged.
    `[Write on board: Matt 12:12 - Lawful to DO WELL]`
  - Sabbath provides opportunities for showing love, compassion, visiting the
    sick, encouraging the lonely – reflecting God's character.
  - True Sabbath-keeping involves active goodness, not just cessation from
    labor.
- **D. Fostering Family Unity**
  - Dedicated time for shared worship (family worship at sunset), meals together
    without rush, walks in nature appreciating God's creation, spiritual
    conversations.
  - Strengthening family bonds by centering the day on God.
  - [Aside: In our fragmented world, the Sabbath offers a unique, divinely
    appointed space for families to reconnect spiritually and emotionally,
    building a legacy of faith.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** The Sabbath is not an arbitrary rule, but God's profound gift
  originating in Eden (Gen 2), affirmed in Law (Ex 20), centered on Christ (Mark
  2), calling us to focused worship (Rev 14, Luke 10), and intended as a day of
  delight, renewal, and blessing (Isa 58, Matt 12).
- It’s an invitation to deeper relationship and rest in Him.
- **Practical Application Recap:**
  `[Whiteboard: Action Steps - Prepare Ahead, Shift Focus (Mary), Worship Together, Do Good Deeds, Seek Delight]`

  to draw near to the Lord of the Sabbath and find true rest and joy? **(RQ)**
