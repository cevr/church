### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Signs of the times point to Christ's soon return (Brief mention, e.g.,
  Matt 24). Urgency is real.
- Central Question: Are we _personally_ ready? Not just aware, but prepared.
  **(RQ)**
- Introduce Luke 21:34-36 as Christ's direct counsel for the last days.
- [Write on board: Luke 21:36 - WATCH & PRAY ALWAYS]
- Thesis: Jesus warns against specific, subtle dangers that make us unfit for
  His coming (Luke 21:34-35) and gives the divine remedy (Luke 21:36).

### Section 1: The Danger of Spiritual Drowsiness (Luke 21:34-35) (12 min)

- **Read Luke 21:34.** Focus: "Take heed to yourselves..." Personal
  responsibility (Luke 21:34a).
- Danger 1: "Surfeiting" (Gluttony/Dissipation).
  - Explain: Overindulgence, not just food, but anything dulling spiritual
    senses (media, pleasure) (cf. Luke 21:34 - "surfeiting").
  - Effect: Spiritual lethargy, inability to discern truth/error, as the heart
    becomes "overcharged" (Luke 21:34b).
  - [Whiteboard: Surfeiting (Luke 21:34) -> Heart Overcharged -> Spiritual
    Dullness]
  - **(RQ)** How can seemingly harmless indulgences slowly "overcharge" our
    hearts and dull our spiritual perception according to this verse (Luke
    21:34)?
- Danger 2: "Drunkenness".
  - Literal sense, but also _spiritual_ drunkenness (cf. Luke 21:34 -
    "drunkenness").
  - Effect: Impaired judgment, loss of self-control, vulnerability, contributing
    to the heart being "overcharged" (Luke 21:34b).
  - [Analogy (from verse): Like driving under influence - spiritual perception
    impaired (heart "overcharged" - Luke 21:34b), reaction time slowed.]
- Danger 3: "Cares of this life".
  - Explain: Legitimate concerns (work, family, finances) becoming overwhelming
    anxieties (cf. Luke 21:34 - "cares of this life").
  - Effect: Chokes spiritual life (Ref Matt 13:22), distracts from eternal
    priorities, leading to the heart being "overcharged" (Luke 21:34b).
  - [Whiteboard: Cares (Luke 21:34) -> Distraction/Anxiety -> Heart Overcharged
    -> Choked Spiritual Life]
  * **(RQ)** Where is the line between responsible stewardship and being
    "overcharged" by worldly cares, based on Jesus' warning here (Luke 21:34)?
- **Read Luke 21:35.** The Snare: Suddenness & Universality.
  - Explain: These dangers (v. 34) make the heart vulnerable when the end comes
    unexpectedly "as a snare" (Luke 21:35a).
  - Applies to "all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth." No
    exceptions (Luke 21:35b).
  - [Aside: Satan tailors these temptations (Luke 21:34)—cares for the
    responsible, dissipation for the pleasure-seeker. He knows our weak points,
    exploiting character defects mentioned implicitly by Christ's warnings.]

### Section 2: The Deception of Spiritual Drunkenness [*] (12 min)

- Transition: Deeper look at "drunkenness" (Luke 21:34) - not just physical, but
  spiritual impairment, a form of hypocrisy.
- **Read Luke 12:45-48.** The Unfaithful Servant.
  - Core Issue: Knowing the Master's will but living contrary to it ("eat and
    drink, and to be drunken") (Luke 12:45-46).
  - This is spiritual hypocrisy – a double life, knowing but not doing (Luke
    12:47).
  - [Whiteboard: Spiritual Drunkenness (Luke 12:45) = Knowing Truth ≠ Living
    Truth (cf. Luke 12:47)]
  - **(RQ)** According to this parable (Luke 12:45-48), what is the danger of
    delaying obedience, thinking the Lord delays His coming?
  - Consequences: Severe judgment, proportional to knowledge ("shall be beaten
    with many stripes... unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
    required") (Luke 12:47-48).
- **Read Isaiah 29:9, 13.** Spiritual Blindness & Lip Service.
  - Connects to spiritual drunkenness: A "spirit of deep sleep," eyes closed to
    spiritual reality ("the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
    sleep, and hath closed your eyes") (Isa 29:9-10).
  - Outward worship ("draw near me with their mouth") but inward distance ("have
    removed their heart far from me") (Isa 29:13).
  - [Whiteboard: Isa 29:13 - Mouth Worship vs. Heart Worship]
  - **(RQ)** How does Isaiah 29:13 describe the state Jesus warns against in
    Luke 12:45-48 and Luke 21:34? How can we avoid this heart condition (Isa
    29:13)?
  - [Brief Illustration Concept (from verses): Like someone reading a warning
    label (knowing God's will - Luke 12:47; Isa 29:13a) but ignoring it
    completely (heart far from God - Isa 29:13b) – knowing the danger but acting
    as if it doesn't exist.]

### Section 3: The Divine Antidote: Watchfulness & Prayer (10 min)

- Transition: Jesus doesn't just warn (Luke 21:34-35); He provides the solution
  (Luke 21:36).
- **Re-read Luke 21:36.** The Command: "Watch ye therefore, and pray always."
  - "Watch": Be spiritually alert, vigilant against the dangers (surfeiting,
    drunkenness, cares - Luke 21:34) (Luke 21:36a). Connects to 1 Peter 5:8 ("Be
    sober, be vigilant...").
  - [Whiteboard: WATCH (Luke 21:36) = Spiritual Alertness (1 Pet 5:8)]
  - "Pray always": Constant communion with God for strength, wisdom, discernment
    to overcome (Luke 21:36a).
  - [Whiteboard: PRAY ALWAYS (Luke 21:36) = Constant Connection -> Strength &
    Wisdom]
  - **(RQ)** What does "praying always" (Luke 21:36) look like practically in a
    busy life, given the need to avoid being "overcharged" (Luke 21:34)?
  - Reference The Great Controversy, p. 530: Prayer as essential for safety
    against temptation. `[Mention source]`
- **Read 1 Peter 5:7.** Casting Cares.
  - Direct answer to the "cares of this life" danger (Luke 21:34) - "Casting all
    your care upon him; for he careth for you" (1 Pet 5:7).
  - Requires active trust and dependence on God's care (1 Pet 5:7b).
  - [Action Step (from verse): Identify one specific "care" (Luke 21:34) this
    week and consciously give it to God in prayer each day, trusting His promise
    in 1 Peter 5:7.]
- **Read Matthew 24:42, 44.** Be Ready Always.
  - Reinforces the need for constant vigilance ("Watch therefore: for ye know
    not what hour your Lord doth come") (Matt 24:42).
  - Readiness is a state of being, achieved through watching and preparedness
    ("Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of
    man cometh") (Matt 24:44).
  - [Whiteboard: Readiness (Matt 24:44) = Constant State of Watching (Matt
    24:42) & Praying (Luke 21:36)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Christ's imminent return demands readiness. He warned against specific
  dangers: spiritual dullness (surfeiting), hypocrisy (spiritual drunkenness),
  and distraction (cares) that "overcharge" the heart (Luke 21:34).
- Reiterate the Solution: Constant vigilance ("Watch") and dependence on God
  ("Pray always") (Luke 21:36).
- The Goal: To be "accounted worthy to escape all these things... and to stand
  before the Son of man" (Luke 21:36). This worthiness comes through Christ,
  maintained by abiding in Him through watchfulness and prayer (Luke 21:36).
- [Aside: Our readiness isn't just for our own sake. Like watchmen on the walls
  (cf. Ezek 33:6), our vigilance serves the whole community. Helping others
  prepare, by life and word, is part of being faithful to the Master's
  instruction (cf. Matt 24:45-46).]
- Final Appeal: Examine your heart. Are any of these dangers (Luke 21:34)
  dulling your spiritual senses? **(RQ)** Commit today to heed Christ's command:
  Watch and Pray (Luke 21:36). Cast your cares upon Him (1 Pet 5:7). Live in
  moment-by-moment readiness (Matt 24:44).
- Call to Action: Choose one practical step from the study (e.g., address a
  specific 'care' through prayer (1 Pet 5:7), cut back on a spiritual dulling
  activity (cf. Luke 21:34), practice consistent prayer (Luke 21:36)).
