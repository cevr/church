### Introduction (6 min)

*   Start with the common closing phrase: "In Jesus' name, Amen."
*   ** (RQ)** Is this just a ritual ending, or does it hold profound meaning?
*   Goal: To explore the deep theological significance packed into this phrase, moving beyond rote repetition.
*   Brief overview: It signifies authority, access, dependence, alignment, and God's glory.
*   [Write on board: "In Jesus' Name" = ?]

### Section 1: The Power in a Name (Biblical Context & Jesus' Exaltation) (9 min)

*   Biblical Significance of Names:
    *   More than labels; represent character, authority, reputation (e.g., Abraham, Jacob/Israel).
    *   ** (RQ)** Why did God sometimes change people's names in Scripture?
*   Jesus' Name Above All Names:
    *   Focus Text: Philippians 2:9-11.
    *   Unpack the passage: God highly exalted Him, gave Him THE name above *every* name.
    *   [Write on board: Phil 2:9-11 -> Exalted Name -> Universal Authority (Every knee bows)]
    *   Praying 'in His name' acknowledges this supreme authority and position.
    *   It's recognizing who He IS.

### Section 2: The Only Access Point (Exclusive Way & Dependence) (12 min) [*]

*   Confessing Faith in the Exclusive Way:
    *   Focus Texts: Hebrews 10:19-20; 1 Timothy 2:5.
    *   Heb 10:19-20: Boldness to enter the Holiest *by the blood of Jesus*, a new and living way.
    *   [Draw simple diagram: Barrier (Sin) -> Cross (Jesus' Blood) -> Access to God]
    *   1 Tim 2:5: One God, one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.
    *   [Write on board: Heb 10:19-20 + 1 Tim 2:5 = Jesus is the ONLY Way/Mediator]
    *   Praying 'in His name' is actively choosing *His* way, rejecting any other supposed path.
*   Acknowledging Total Dependence:
    *   Focus Text: Acts 4:12.
    *   Unpack the verse: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
    *   [Write on board: Acts 4:12 -> Salvation ONLY in Jesus' Name]
    *   This isn't just about initial salvation, but ongoing dependence for *everything* (forgiveness, strength, guidance).
    *   ** (RQ)** How does relying on our own merits contradict praying 'in Jesus' name'?
    *   [Aside: Like needing a specific key to unlock a door, Jesus' name is the only 'key' that grants access to the Father's resources and presence. No other key works.]

### Section 3: Aligning Our Ask (His Will, Character & Glory) (11 min)

*   Motive: God's Glory, Not Selfish Gain:
    *   Focus Text: John 14:13 (Central Verse).
    *   Unpack: "...whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, *that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son*."
    *   The purpose of answered prayer in His name is the Father's glory.
    *   [Write on board: John 14:13 -> Ask in His Name -> Father Glorified]
    *   ** (RQ)** How can we check if our prayer motives align with bringing God glory?
*   Consistency with His Character and Will:
    *   Focus Text: Romans 10:13 (Context: Confession/Belief leading to salvation).
    *   "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." - Calling implies alignment with who He is.
    *   Praying 'in Jesus' name' means asking for things consistent with His revealed character (love, justice, mercy, holiness) and His Word.
    *   [Write Question on board: Does my request align with Jesus' character & God's Word?]
    *   Cannot ask God to bless sin or contradict His principles (e.g., praying for success in a dishonest venture).
    *   [Concept (based on John 14:13): Imagine asking a righteous king for resources 'in his name' to fund a rebellion against him. It makes no sense. Similarly, asking 'in Jesus' name' for something against His will is contradictory.]
*   Dependence on His Merits, Not Ours:
    *   True prayer in His name flows from humility, recognizing we have no standing before God on our own.
    *   It's pleading *His* righteousness, *His* sacrifice, *His* worthiness.

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

*   Summary: Praying 'in Jesus' name' is:
    *   Acknowledging His Supreme Authority (Phil 2:9-11).
    *   Claiming Him as the Only Way to the Father (Heb 10:19-20, 1 Tim 2:5).
    *   Confessing Total Dependence on Him for Salvation and All Needs (Acts 4:12).
    *   Aligning our requests with His Character and Will (Rom 10:13 context).
    *   Seeking God's Glory above all (John 14:13).
    *   Relying solely on His Merits.
*   [Aside: Using Jesus' name in prayer isn't a magic formula like an incantation. It's a declaration of our position â€“ standing under His authority, covered by His sacrifice, and seeking His purposes.]
*   Challenge: Move beyond rote repetition. Let "In Jesus' name" be a conscious declaration of faith, dependence, and alignment each time we pray.
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from the Text):**
    1.  **Pause Before Praying:** Before saying "In Jesus' name," take a brief moment to consciously remember His authority (Phil 2:9-11) and your dependence on Him alone for access (Heb 10:19-20, Acts 4:12).
    2.  **Review Your Request:** Ask yourself: "Does this request align with Jesus' character as revealed in Scripture, and does it ultimately aim to glorify the Father?" (John 14:13). Adjust if necessary.
    3.  **Verbalize Dependence:** Occasionally, explicitly state in your prayer *why* you come in His name, e.g., "Father, I come to You only through the merits and sacrifice of Jesus..." (1 Tim 2:5).
*   ** (RQ)** How will understanding this change the *way* we approach God in prayer?
*   Final Appeal/Invitation: Embrace the privilege and responsibility of praying in the powerful, saving, authoritative name of Jesus Christ. Let it shape not just the end of our prayers, but their entire substance and our confidence before the throne of grace.
