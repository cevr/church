### Introduction (6 min)
-   What is "Success"? Contrast worldly definitions (wealth, fame) with God's definition.
-   Introduce Joshua: Stepping into Moses' shoes â€“ a daunting task.
-   Context: Israel poised to enter Canaan. Need for divine guidance.
-   Purpose of Study: To uncover God's unchanging principles for genuine success, as given to Joshua.
-   [Write on board: Success = ? vs. God's Success (Joshua 1)]
-   RQ: Are we seeking worldly success or the success God promises?

### Section 1: God's Purpose & Promise (Joshua 1:2-4) (10 min)
-   **The Need:** Direction and assurance after leadership change.
-   **Biblical Principle (v. 2):** God clearly defines the task/purpose. "Arise, go over this Jordan..."
    -   [Whiteboard: God gives PURPOSE (v.2)]
    -   Connection: Understanding *our* God-given purpose is foundational.
-   **Biblical Principle (v. 3-4):** God gives specific promises of provision and territory.
    -   "Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given you..."
    -   [Whiteboard: God gives PROMISE (v.3-4)]
    -   Faith lays hold of these promises.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** God has a purpose and promises for *us* today (spiritual inheritance, areas of service).
-   RQ: What specific task or area of growth (your "Canaan") is God calling you to step into by faith? (RQ)
-   **Actionable Step:** Prayerfully ask God to clarify His immediate purpose for your life this week.

### Section 2: God's Presence & Power (Joshua 1:5-6, 9) (12 min)
-   **The Need:** Overcoming fear and inadequacy in the face of challenges ("giants").
-   **Biblical Principle (v. 5):** God's unwavering presence is the key assurance.
    -   "No man shall be able to stand before you... as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you nor forsake you."
    -   [Whiteboard: God's PRESENCE (v.5, 9b) -> No Fear]
-   **Biblical Principle (v. 6, 9a):** Courage and strength are *commanded* because God is present.
    -   "Be strong and of good courage..." (Repeated theme)
    -   Source isn't self, but God: "...for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go." (v. 9b)
    -   [Whiteboard: Courage/Strength (v.6, 9a) <--- BECAUSE God is Present]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Our challenges (personal struggles, witnessing opportunities) require God-given courage rooted in His presence.
-   [Aside: "Sometimes we focus so much on the 'giants' ahead, we forget the Almighty God who walks beside us. His presence isn't just comfort; it's our qualification for the task."]
-   RQ: How does consciously remembering 'God is with me' change how you approach difficulties? (RQ)
-   **Actionable Step:** When facing a challenge this week, pause and audibly affirm Joshua 1:9b: "The Lord my God is with me."

### Section 3: The Condition - Obedience & Meditation (Joshua 1:7-8) [*] (10 min)
-   **The Need:** Knowing *how* to access God's promised success and maintain His blessing.
-   **Biblical Principle (v. 7):** Strict, unwavering obedience to God's revealed will (His Law/Word).
    -   "Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe to do according to all the law... do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left..."
    -   [Whiteboard: Obedience (v.7) - Precise, Undeviating]
-   **Biblical Principle (v. 8a):** Constant meditation on God's Word is essential for obedience.
    -   "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night..."
    -   Meditation -> Understanding -> Application.
    -   [Whiteboard: Meditate Day & Night (v.8a)]
-   **The Result (v. 8b):** Obedience flowing from meditation leads to true prosperity and success.
    -   "...that you may observe to do... For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success."
    -   [Draw Arrow on Board: Meditate -> Obey -> SUCCESS (v.8)]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Success isn't automatic; it's conditional on our relationship with God's Word and our willingness to obey.
-   [Brief Analogy Concept (from v.8): God's Word like a map; meditation is studying it, obedience is following the route to the destination (success).]
-   RQ: How central is deep, daily engagement with Scripture to your pursuit of God's will? (RQ)
-   **Actionable Steps:** 1. Schedule 10-15 minutes daily for focused Bible meditation (not just reading). 2. Identify one specific command from your reading to consciously obey today.

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

    -   [Point to Whiteboard elements, showing the flow]
-   Reiterate: Trust and Obedience are inseparable (
