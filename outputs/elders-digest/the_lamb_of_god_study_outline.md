### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the concept of sacrifice in the Old Testament sanctuary service.
  - Why lambs? What did they represent? (RQ)
  - Connection to Passover (Exodus 12).
- Introduce the central figure: John the Baptist's profound declaration.
  - Read **John 1:29**. `[Write on board: John 1:29 - Behold the Lamb of God]`
  - What did John mean? What 'sin of the world' needed taking away? (RQ)
- Purpose of Study: To understand _why_ Jesus is called the Lamb, His
  qualifications, His sacrifice, and His power to save today through a study of
  key scriptures.

### Section 1: The Lamb Identified & His Mission (10 min)

- **Who Was This Lamb? Jesus' Unique Identity**
  - Conceived by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35) - Divine origin.
  - Demonstrated unique conduct: Miracles (Acts 2:22), Authoritative Teaching
    (Matt 7:28-29).
  - Made Divine Claims: Son of God (John 10:36), Equal with God (John 10:30).
  - Why was this unique identity necessary for the Lamb? (RQ)
- **The Lamb's Specific Mission: To Seek and Save**
  - Read **Luke 19:10** - "For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that
    which was lost."
  - Connect to John 1:29 - His mission was to _take away sin_.
  - `[Write on board: Mission = Seek, Save, Take Away Sin (Luke 19:10, John 1:29)]`
  - This wasn't accidental; it was His purpose for coming.

### Section 2: The Lamb Qualified (Spotless & Submissive) (12 min) [*]

- **Qualification 1: A Spotless Lamb (Purity)**
  - The Need: Sacrificial lambs had to be without blemish (Exodus 12:5).
  - Read **1 Peter 1:18-19**.
    `[Write on board: 1 Peter 1:19 - Precious Blood... Lamb without blemish]`
  - Jesus' Sinlessness:
    - He knew no sin (2 Cor 5:21).
    - Did no sin, no guile in His mouth (1 Pet 2:22).
  - Why was absolute sinlessness essential for the sacrifice to be effective?
    (RQ)
  - `[Concept: Like a perfect substitute required in a legal transaction - only a debt-free person can pay another's debt.]`
- **Qualification 2: A Submissive Lamb (Willingness)**
  - Read **Isaiah 53:7**.
    `[Write on board: Isa 53:7 - Oppressed, Afflicted... opened not his mouth]`
  - Jesus' Willing Submission:
    - Not My will, but Thine be done (Luke 22:42).
    - Endured the cross out of love and obedience (Phil 2:8, Heb 12:2).
  - How does His submission contrast with humanity's typical reaction to
    suffering? (RQ)
  - His submission wasn't weakness, but strength under control for a divine
    purpose.
  - `[Aside: Often we think submission means being a doormat. But Christ's submission was a powerful, active choice rooted in love for the Father and for us. It was strength directed by divine purpose, not passive resignation.]`

### Section 3: The Lamb Sacrificed & Victorious (12 min)

- **The Necessity of Death: Shedding of Blood**
  - Read **Hebrews 9:22**.
    `[Write on board: Heb 9:22 - Without shedding of blood = no remission]`
  - Why blood? Represents life given (Lev 17:11).
  - Sin's penalty is death (Rom 6:23). The Lamb died _in our place_.
  - This fulfills the symbolism of the Old Testament sacrifices.
- **The Victory of the Lamb: Resurrection Power**
  - Death could not hold Him (Acts 2:24).
  - Resurrection confirms His identity and victory over sin/death (Rom 1:4).
  - He is the _living_ Lamb, now ministering for us (Heb 7:25).
  - Read **Revelation 5:12**.
    `[Write on board: Rev 5:12 - Worthy is the Lamb that was slain!]`
  - How does the resurrection change the meaning of the cross? (RQ)
- **The Power of the Living Lamb Today**
  - Cleanses from Sin: Read **1 John 1:7**.
    `[Whiteboard: Power -> Cleanse (1 John 1:7)]`
    - As far as east is from west (Ps 103:12).
  - Converts Souls: From alienation to belonging (Eph 2:12-13).
    `[Whiteboard: Power -> Convert (Eph 2:12-13)]`
  - Changes Lives: New creation (2 Cor 5:17).
    `[Whiteboard: Power -> Change (2 Cor 5:17)]`
  - `[Analogy: Like a powerful solvent, the blood of Christ doesn't just cover sin, it dissolves its power and guilt when applied by faith.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Summary: We've traced the journey of the Lamb of God:
  - His unique identity and mission (John 1:29, Luke 19:10).
  - His perfect qualifications: spotless and submissive (1 Pet 1:19, Isa 53:7).
  - His necessary sacrifice and victorious resurrection (Heb 9:22, Rev 5:12).
  - His ongoing power to save and transform (1 John 1:7, 2 Cor 5:17).
- The core truth: God provided the perfect sacrifice Himself out of immense
  love.
- `[Aside: Sometimes the complexities of theology can obscure the simple, beautiful truth: God loves you so much He sent His Son, the perfect Lamb, to die *for you*, so you could live *with Him*. Don't let anything complicate that core message.]`
- **The Need/Question:** Do you recognize your need for the Lamb's sacrifice?
  Have you personally accepted His cleansing blood? (RQ)
- **The Biblical Principle/Solution:** Jesus, the Lamb, _has already_ taken away
  the sin of the world (John 1:29). His blood cleanses _all_ sin (1 John 1:7).
- **Bridging to Practice:** Believing this isn't just mental assent; it's
  trusting His work _for you_.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1.  Acknowledge your need for His forgiveness (based on Rom 3:23).
  2.  Believe He died _for you_ and accept His sacrifice personally (based on
      John 3:16).
  3.  Confess your sins, trusting His promise to cleanse (based on 1 John 1:9).
- **Invitation:**
  - For those who haven't: Accept the Lamb of God today. Let His sacrifice cover
    your sin.
  - For believers: Reconsecrate your life to the Lamb who was slain and is now
    alive, walking daily in the cleansing power of His blood (1 John 1:7).
- Final Prayer
