### Introduction: Beyond Just Existing (5 min)

- **The Need:** Many churches exist, but are they _healthy_? Are they fulfilling
  God's intended purpose? **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle:** A healthy church isn't just a building or a weekly
  meeting; it's a living organism actively functioning as designed by God (Eph
  4:16).
  - [Whiteboard: Healthy Church = Fulfilling Biblical Purposes]
- Introduce the five key purposes derived from Scripture – the vital signs of a
  healthy body of Christ.
- Read Central Verse: Ephesians 4:16 - Emphasize interconnectedness and growth
  through function.

### 1. Worship: Celebrating God's Presence (7 min)

- **The Need:** Is our worship just ritual, or a genuine encounter? **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (Acts 2:46-47; Rom 12:1):**
  - Worship is celebrating God's presence and worth (Acts 2:46-47 - gladness,
    praising God).
  - It involves the whole being – mind and heart engaged.
  - It's expressed not just in song/prayer, but in a life surrendered to God
    (Rom 12:1 - living sacrifice).
  - [Whiteboard: WORSHIP (Acts 2:47, Rom 12:1) = Celebrating Presence + Living
    Sacrifice]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Worship isn't passive observation; it's active
  participation and surrender.
  - [Analogy (from Rom 12:1): Worship like dedicating a tool for its master's
    specific use.]
- **Actionable Steps (from Rom 12:1):**
  1.  Consciously dedicate your day/tasks to God.
  2.  Engage mind _and_ heart during corporate worship.
  3.  See daily service/work as an act of worship.
- **Invitation:** Let's commit to worship that is both heartfelt and
  life-encompassing.

### 2. Ministry: Sharing God's Love (7 min)

- **The Need:** Are we meeting the real needs around us, like the early church?
  **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (Acts 2:44-45):**
  - Ministry is demonstrating God's love by meeting needs.
  - Early church example: Shared resources to meet _everyone's_ needs
    (spiritual, emotional, physical, social).
  - Our 'neighbor' is anyone God places in our path.
  - [Whiteboard: MINISTRY (Acts 2:44-45) = Meeting Needs (Total Person)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Ministry isn't just for pastors; it's the work of
  every believer.
  - [Aside: Meeting practical needs often opens hearts to spiritual truth. It's
    like tilling the soil before planting the seed – preparing the way for the
    Gospel message.]
- **Actionable Steps (from Acts 2:44-45):**
  1.  Identify a need in your church or community this week.
  2.  Pray for opportunities to serve someone practically.
  3.  Support church ministries meeting tangible needs.
- **Invitation:** Ask God to show you who needs His love demonstrated through
  you.

### 3. Evangelism: Sharing God's Message [*] (7 min)

- **The Need:** Is the church actively sharing the good news, or keeping it
  internal? **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (Matt 28:19-20):**
  - Evangelism is the church acting as God's agent of redemption.
  - The Great Commission: Go and make disciples.
  - Requires both _sharing_ the message and _living_ the message.
  - [Whiteboard: EVANGELISM (Matt 28:19) = Go + Share + Live the Gospel]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Every member has a sphere of influence.
  - [Hypothetical Concept (based on Matt 28:19): If each believer reached just
    one person, how quickly would the world hear?]
- **Actionable Steps (from Matt 28:19):**
  1.  Pray for boldness and opportunities to share your faith.
  2.  Invite someone to church or a small group.
  3.  Live authentically, letting your life witness for Christ.
- **Invitation:** Be intentional about being God's messenger this week.

### 4. Fellowship: Incorporating God's Family [*] (7 min)

- **The Need:** Do members feel truly connected, like family, or isolated?
  **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (Acts 2:46-47; Acts 5:14):**
  - Fellowship is incorporating believers into the family of God.
  - Early church: Met together consistently, shared life (Acts 2:46-47).
  - Result: Believers were added (Acts 5:14).
  - Neglecting fellowship leads to coldness and hinders growth.
  - [Whiteboard: FELLOWSHIP (Acts 2:46-47) = Connection + Community + Growth]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Church is more than an event; it's a community.
  - [Metaphor (from Eph 4:16): The church body needs every joint connected and
    supplying its part to be healthy.]
- **Actionable Steps (from Acts 2:46-47):**
  1.  Attend services/groups regularly.
  2.  Intentionally connect with someone new or someone sitting alone.
  3.  Participate in church social events or small groups.
- **Invitation:** Commit to building and participating in genuine Christian
  community.

### 5. Discipleship: Educating God's People (7 min)

- **The Need:** Are believers growing spiritually mature, or remaining spiritual
  infants? **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (Matt 28:19-20; 2 Pet 3:18; Eph 4:11-12):**
  - Discipleship is educating believers toward spiritual maturity.
  - Goal: Grow in grace and knowledge (2 Pet 3:18).
  - Part of the Great Commission: Teaching obedience (Matt 28:20).
  - Equipping members for their own ministry work (Eph 4:11-12).
  - Moving beyond belief to active following and character transformation.
  - [Whiteboard: DISCIPLESHIP (2 Pet 3:18, Eph 4:12) = Growth (Grace/Knowledge)
    + Equipping for Service]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Discipleship is a lifelong journey, not a
  graduation.
  - [Aside: True education, as understood by pioneers, wasn't just information
    transfer, but character building. Discipleship aims for Christlike character
    through understanding and applying God's Word.]
- **Actionable Steps (from 2 Pet 3:18, Eph 4:12):**
  1.  Engage in daily personal Bible study and prayer.
  2.  Participate in Sabbath School/Bible study groups.
  3.  Seek ways to use your spiritual gifts in ministry.
- **Invitation:** Embrace the call to continually grow and help others grow.

### Conclusion & Application (5 min)

- **Recap:** Briefly review the five vital signs: Worship, Ministry, Evangelism,
  Fellowship, Discipleship.
  - [Whiteboard: List 5 Purposes side-by-side]
- **The Balance:** A healthy church strives for _all five_ purposes in balance.
  Overemphasizing one or neglecting others leads to imbalance (Eph 4:16 -
  _every_ part working).
- **The Call:** Avoid being a 'spectator'. Actively participate in _all_ aspects
  of church life.
  - How is _our_ church doing in these five areas? **(RQ)**
  - How are _you_ personally contributing to each purpose? **(RQ)**
- **Final Appeal:** Let's commit, individually and corporately, to being a truly
  healthy church – one that actively celebrates God (Worship), serves others
  (Ministry), shares the Gospel (Evangelism), builds community (Fellowship), and
  grows believers (Discipleship), all for God's glory and the building up of His
  body (Eph 4:16).
