### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the topic: Reaching out to Jesus in our deepest need.
- Briefly mention the setting: Jesus amidst a pressing crowd (Mark 5:24).
- **(RQ)** What does true desperation look like? How does it drive us?
- Read Central Verse: Mark 5:28. This simple thought held immense power.
- [Whiteboard: Title - Touch the Hem; Central Verse Ref: Mark 5:28]

### Section 1: Desperation & the Effects of Sin (10 min)

- **The Need:** Human desperation apart from Christ.
  - Read Mark 5:25-26: Describe the woman's condition.
    - 12 years suffering: Physical ailment.
    - Spent all her living: Financial ruin.
    - Suffered many things of physicians: Hope exhausted in human means.
    - Nothing bettered, but rather grew worse: Situation hopeless.
    - Ceremonially unclean (Leviticus 15:25-27): Social and spiritual isolation.
  - [Whiteboard: NEED (Mark 5:25-26) -> Physical, Financial, Social, Spiritual
    Suffering = Effects of Sin's Curse]
  - **(RQ)** How does sin manifest suffering and isolation in our lives today,
    even if not physically apparent? (Rom 3:23)
  - Point: Her condition reflects humanity's state under sin – broken, isolated,
    unable to heal self.

### Section 2: Determined Faith Amidst Obstacles (10 min) [*]

- **The Decision & Action:** Determined faith overcomes obstacles.
  - Read Mark 5:27: "When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind..."
    - Heard of Jesus: Faith comes by hearing (Rom 10:17). Information sparked
      hope.
    - Came in the press behind: Active effort required.
      - Obstacles: The crowd (physical barrier), her uncleanness
        (social/religious barrier), potential shame.
      - [Whiteboard: OBSTACLES (Mark 5:27) -> Crowd, Law, Fear vs. DETERMINED
        FAITH]
    - Point: Faith isn't passive wishing; it requires actively pressing through
      difficulties to reach Jesus.
  - Read Mark 5:28 again: "For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall
    be whole."
    - Simple, focused faith. Not demanding a speech or grand gesture, just
      contact.
    - [Analogy (Concept): Like someone desperately needing medicine, pushing
      through a crowd to reach the only doctor who has the cure.]
  - **(RQ)** What 'crowds' or obstacles prevent us from actively reaching out to
    Jesus in faith today? (Heb 12:1)

### Section 3: The Touch of Faith & Divine Response (10 min)

- **The Contact & The Question:** Jesus is sensitive to the touch of faith.
  - Read Mark 5:29: "And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and
    she felt in her body that she was healed..."
    - Immediate, complete healing. Direct result of faith-filled contact.
  - Read Mark 5:30-31: "Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue
    [dunamis - power] had gone out of him, turned... Who touched my clothes?"
    - Jesus felt the specific drain of power – distinct from casual jostling.
    - [Whiteboard: Casual Contact (Crowd) vs. FAITH TOUCH (Woman) -> Jesus feels
      the difference. Virtue/Power (Mark 5:30)]
    - Disciples' logical response vs. Jesus' spiritual perception.
    - Point: Jesus responds uniquely to the touch motivated by genuine faith and
      need.
  - **(RQ)** Do we sometimes approach Jesus casually, like the crowd, instead of
    with intentional, needy faith? (James 4:8)
  - [Aside: Our prayers and study can be like the crowd, just going through
    motions. Or they can be like her touch – intentional, desperate, expecting
    connection and power.]

### Section 4: Testimony & Transformation (5 min)

- **The Revelation & The Result:** Healing leads to testimony and relationship.
  - Read Mark 5:32-33: "He looked round about to see her... the woman fearing
    and trembling... came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth."
    - Jesus sought her out – He desires relationship, not just anonymous
      miracles.
    - Her fear vs. her honesty. Overcoming fear to testify.
    - Point: Personal testimony is vital after experiencing God's power. (Rev
      12:11)
  - Read Mark 5:34 & Luke 8:48: "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in
    peace, and be whole of thy plague."
    - More than expected: Not just physical healing, but relational acceptance
      ("Daughter").
    - [Whiteboard: RESULT (Mark 5:34) -> Faith -> Wholeness (Physical &
      Spiritual) + Peace + Relationship ('Daughter')]
    - Assurance given: Faith was the key. Peace replaces fear. Ongoing
      wholeness.
    - Point: Coming to Jesus brings not just solutions, but adoption and peace.
      (John 1:12)
  - [Aside: Like finding a lost treasure, sharing our testimony of Christ's work
    isn't boasting about ourselves, but revealing the value and power of the One
    we found.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** Recap the journey: Desperation -> Hearing -> Determined Faith ->
  Overcoming Obstacles -> Touching Jesus -> Healing -> Testimony -> Relationship
  & Peace.
- **The Invitation:** Come to Jesus 'as you are'.
  - He knows your condition (physical, financial, spiritual desperation).
  - He recognizes the touch of faith, even amidst the 'crowd' of life's
    pressures.
  - Don't let obstacles (fear, past failures, opinions of others) stop you.
  - **(RQ)** What step of faith, however small, do you need to take today to
    'touch the hem of His garment'?
- **Actionable Steps (derived from the text):**
  1.  Identify your area of deepest need (like the woman acknowledged hers -
      Mark 5:26).
  2.  Focus your faith on Jesus' power and willingness (like her simple
      statement - Mark 5:28).
  3.  Actively press through one obstacle this week to spend time seeking Him
      (prayer, study) despite difficulty (like she pressed through the crowd -
      Mark 5:27).
  4.  Be ready to share what He does (like she told 'all the truth' - Mark
      5:33).
- Final Appeal: Reach out in faith today. He is waiting, sensitive to your
  touch. (Matt 11:28)
- Closing Prayer
