### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: Imagine receiving a personal performance review from Jesus Christ Himself. That's what the seven churches in Revelation received. These are real letters with timeless messages.
-   Focus: Ephesus – a church praised for its hard work, endurance, and doctrinal purity, yet facing a critical, heart-level issue.
-   Purpose: To examine Christ's message to Ephesus, understand the danger of losing our "first love," and apply His remedy to our own spiritual lives.
-   [Write on board: Revelation 2 - Christ's Message to Ephesus & Us]
-   **RQ:** If a church looks good on the outside (works, doctrine), what could possibly be wrong on the inside?

### Section 1: Christ Among His Churches (Rev 2:1) (6 min)

-   **Verse Focus:** Revelation 2:1 - "Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;"
-   **Christ's Authority & Care:**
    -   "He that holdeth the seven stars": Christ has ultimate authority over the messengers/leaders ("angels") of the churches ("stars"). [Write on board: Stars = Angels/Messengers]
    -   "in his right hand": Signifies power, protection, and control. They belong to Him.
    -   "who walketh in the midst": Christ is not distant; He is actively present, observing, and involved within His churches ("candlesticks"). [Write on board: Candlesticks = Churches]
    -   **RQ:** How does knowing Christ is actively walking *among* us change how we view our church life and personal devotion?
-   **Significance:** The message comes from the One who knows them intimately and holds their destiny.

### Section 2: Commendable, Yet Incomplete (Rev 2:2-3) (9 min)

-   **Verse Focus:** Revelation 2:2-3 - "I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars: And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted."
-   **Christ's Commendation:** He sees and acknowledges the good.
    -   "I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience": He recognized their diligent effort and endurance. (v.2a)
    -   "canst not bear them which are evil... tried them... found them liars": He praised their doctrinal discernment and intolerance of false teachings/teachers. (v.2b) [Write on board: Works ✓ Patience ✓ Discernment ✓]
    -   "hast borne... patience... laboured... not fainted": He highlighted their perseverance through trials for His name's sake. (v.3)
    -   **RQ:** Is it possible to be doctrinally sound and actively working for God, yet still be missing something vital?
-   **Illustration:** Imagine a beautifully crafted car, engine running smoothly, perfectly painted, but the transmission is disconnected from the engine. It makes noise, looks good, but doesn't *go* anywhere relationally with the driver. Their works were impressive, but the connection of love was weakening.

### Section 3: The Critical Lack - Lost First Love (Rev 2:4) [*] (8 min)

-   **Verse Focus:** Revelation 2:4 - "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love."
-   **The "Nevertheless":** A sharp turn despite the commendation. This isn't minor.
    -   "I have somewhat against thee": Christ identifies a core problem.
    -   "because thou hast left thy first love": The central issue – the passionate, devoted, all-consuming love they initially had for Christ had cooled. (v.4) [Write on board: The Problem: Left First Love]
    -   **RQ:** What does "first love" for Christ look like practically? How is it different from just "doing the right things"?
-   **Defining "First Love":** Not just emotion, but the foundational relationship, the driving passion, the delight in Christ Himself that fuels everything else. It's the "why" behind the "what."
-   `[Aside: Remember Paul's commendation of the Ephesians' initial "love toward all the saints" (Eph 1:15) and his prayer for them to be "rooted and grounded in love" (Eph 3:17). Somewhere along the line, that foundational love diminished, even while outward activity continued.]`

### Section 4: The Path Back - Remember, Repent, Repeat (Rev 2:5) (7 min)

-   **Verse Focus:** Revelation 2:5 - "Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent."
-   **Need/Question (Implied from v.4):** How can we recover this lost "first love"? What is Christ's prescription?
-   **Biblical Principle (v.5):** Christ gives a clear, three-step process. [Write on board: Remember -> Repent -> Repeat (First Works)]
    -   1.  **"Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen"**: Recall the height of that initial love, zeal, and relationship. What was it like? What has changed?
    -   2.  **"and repent"**: Acknowledge the decline as sin. Turn away from the coldness and apathy. Change the mind and heart's direction back towards Him.
    -   3.  **"and do the first works"**: Not just *any* works, but the works that naturally flowed from that first love (e.g., passionate prayer, eager Bible study, joyful witnessing, fellowship driven by love). **RQ:** Are the "first works" different from the "works" mentioned in verse 2, or is it about the *motivation* behind them?
-   **Bridging:** This isn't just ancient history. We too can fall into routines, maintain outward forms of religion, but lose the passionate heart-connection with Jesus. The same remedy applies.
-   **Warning:** "or else I will come... and will remove thy candlestick" - Loss of love isn't trivial; it threatens the church's very existence as Christ's light-bearer.
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from v.5):**
    1.  **Remember:** Set aside time this week to reflect: When did my relationship with Christ feel most vibrant? What characterized that time?
    2.  **Repent:** Honestly confess any coldness or drift to God. Ask for forgiveness and a renewed heart.
    3.  **Repeat:** Intentionally re-engage in one specific activity that characterized your "first love" (e.g., dedicated time in prayer, sharing your faith with someone, reading the Bible with fresh hunger).

### Section 5: The Spirit's Call & The Overcomer's Reward (Rev 2:7) (5 min)

-   **Verse Focus:** Revelation 2:7 - "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God."
-   **Personal Responsibility:**
    -   "He that hath an ear, let him hear": This message is personal. Each individual must listen and respond. (v.7a) **RQ:** Am I truly *hearing* what the Spirit is saying through this message?
    -   "what the Spirit saith unto the churches": The Holy Spirit applies Christ's message universally.
-   **The Promise to the Overcomer:**
    -   "To him that overcometh": Overcoming involves heeding the call – remembering, repenting, returning to first love, and persevering. [Write on board: Overcomer = Hear + Repent + Persevere]
    -   "will I give to eat of the tree of life... paradise of God": The ultimate reward is restoration to Edenic perfection and eternal life in God's presence, accessed through Christ. (v.7b)
-   `[Aside: The Tree of Life, first seen in Genesis 2-3 and barred after the Fall, reappears here as the reward for those who overcome through Christ, signifying the complete reversal of sin's consequences and full restoration of relationship with God.]`
-   **Illustration:** Overcoming isn't about achieving perfection on our own, but like a runner fixing their eyes on the finish line (Jesus) and refusing to quit despite fatigue or distraction, we press on by His strength, fueled by renewed love.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

-   **Summary:** The Ephesian church reminds us that diligent service and doctrinal correctness, while vital, are insufficient without the foundational love for Christ. Works without love become hollow. [Point to Whiteboard: Works ✓ Patience ✓ Discernment ✓ BUT Love? -> Remember, Repent, Repeat]
-   **Reiterate Need:** We all face the danger of spiritual cooling. Do we recognize this need in ourselves or our church?
-   **Reiterate Principle:** Christ's call is clear: Remember, Repent, Do the first works.
-   **Reiterate Action Steps:** Recall the simple steps: Reflect/Remember, Confess/Repent, Re-engage/Repeat.
-   **Invitation:** Let's heed the Spirit's call today. If your love has cooled, don't despair. Christ offers the way back. Will you choose to remember, repent, and return to Him as your first love? Let's ask Him now for the grace to do so, that we might be overcomers and receive the promise of the Tree of Life.
