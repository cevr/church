### Introduction (5 min)

*   **Greeting & Prayer**
*   **Engage:** What does 'health' mean to us physically? (RQ) What about spiritually? How do we know if we are spiritually healthy?
*   **Introduce Theme:** Today, we explore biblical markers of true spiritual health, focusing on the concept of 'soundness' found in Scripture.
*   **Central Verse:** Read Titus 2:1. What does 'sound doctrine' mean? `[Write on board: Sound Doctrine (Titus 2:1)]`
*   **Outline Preview:** We'll examine the foundation (doctrine), the fruit (faith & life), and an indicator (speech).

### Section 1: The Foundation - Sound Doctrine (10 min)

*   **What is Sound Doctrine?**
    *   Definition: Healthy, wholesome, trustworthy teaching based *solely* on God's Word. `[Write on board: Sound = Healthy, Trustworthy]`
    *   Scriptural Basis:
        *   Titus 2:1: Commanded to speak it.
        *   Titus 1:9: Holding fast the faithful word; able to exhort and convict dissenters.
        *   1 Timothy 1:10 (context): Contrasted with things contrary to sound doctrine.
    *   Why is it foundational? (RQ) It shapes belief, which shapes character and action. `[Draw: Doctrine -> Belief -> Character -> Action]`
*   **Receiving Sound Doctrine:**
    *   Requires humility and willingness to align with God's revealed truth (James 1:21).
    *   Requires careful study and discernment (Acts 17:11).
    *   `[Aside: Like building a house, the foundation must be solid biblical truth. A slightly skewed foundation affects the entire structure, no matter how good the rest looks initially.]`

### Section 2: The Danger - Unsound Doctrine [*] (7 min)

*   **The Appeal of False Teaching:**
    *   2 Timothy 4:3-4: People turn away from truth, seeking teachers who say what their 'itching ears' want to hear.
    *   Why is false doctrine appealing? (RQ) Often caters to self, convenience, or worldly desires. Avoids hard truths (repentance, self-denial).
    *   `[Write on board: Itching Ears (2 Tim 4:3) vs. Faithful Word (Titus 1:9)]`
*   **The Consequences:**
    *   Leads to spiritual unhealthiness, confusion, discouragement (Gal 1:6-9).
    *   Can justify sin or compromise (cf. 1 Tim 1:8 - the law is good if used lawfully, implying misuse/misunderstanding leads to problems).
    *   Ultimately turns people away from God to fables (2 Tim 4:4).
    *   `[Concept: Spiritual 'junk food' - tastes good initially but leads to malnutrition and disease.]`

### Section 3: The Fruit - Sound Faith & Life (10 min)

*   **Sound Doctrine Produces Sound Faith:**
    *   Titus 1:13: Rebuke sharply, that they may be 'sound in the faith'.
    *   Titus 2:2: Older men to be 'sound in faith, in charity, in patience'.
    *   What does 'sound faith' look like? (RQ) It's not just belief *about* God, but active trust *in* God, demonstrated consistently. `[Write on board: Sound Faith (Titus 1:13, 2:2) = Active Trust + Godly Living]`
*   **Characteristics of Sound Faith (Examples from Titus 2):**
    *   Temperance, gravity, self-control (v. 2, 6).
    *   Love, endurance (v. 2).
    *   Reverence, kindness, purity (v. 3-5).
    *   Integrity, seriousness (v. 7).
    *   These aren't suggestions, but *evidence* of a faith made healthy by sound doctrine. `[Whiteboard: Link 'Sound Doctrine' to list of 'Sound Faith Characteristics (Titus 2:2-8)']`
    *   How does sound doctrine *produce* these? (RQ) By revealing God's character and His power to transform us (2 Cor 3:18).

### Section 4: The Indicator - Sound Speech [*] (7 min)

*   **Speech Reveals the Heart:**
    *   Matthew 12:34: "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
    *   Titus 2:7-8: Show integrity, reverence, incorruptibility, *sound speech* that cannot be condemned.
    *   What constitutes 'sound speech'? (RQ) `[Write on board: Sound Speech (Titus 2:8)]`
*   **Characteristics of Sound Speech:**
    *   Cannot be condemned (Titus 2:8): Blameless, truthful, constructive.
    *   Edifying: Builds others up (Ephesians 4:29). `[Write: Eph 4:29 - Builds Up]`
    *   Gracious: Seasoned with salt (Colossians 4:6).
    *   Contrasted with: Corrupt communication, foolish talking, jesting (Eph 4:29, 5:4), gossip, negativity.
    *   `[Aside: Our words are like seeds. Sound speech sows encouragement, truth, and grace, yielding a healthy spiritual harvest in ourselves and others. Unsound speech sows weeds.]`
*   **Connection:** Our words reflect the doctrine we've internalized and the state of our faith.

### Conclusion & Practical Application (6 min)

*   **Summary:** True spiritual health is rooted in receiving and living by God's sound doctrine (Titus 2:1), which produces sound faith (Titus 1:13, 2:2) demonstrated in godly character (Titus 2:2-7) and sound speech (Titus 2:8).
*   **Self-Evaluation (The Need/Question):** How can we assess our own spiritual health based on these biblical markers? (RQ)
*   **Biblical Principle/Solution:** Regularly examine:
    1.  **Doctrine:** Am I grounding my beliefs firmly in Scripture alone? (Titus 1:9) `[Whiteboard: Checkpoint 1: Doctrine (Titus 1:9)]`
    2.  **Faith/Life:** Is my faith producing the fruit of godly character described in Titus 2? (Titus 2:2-7) `[Whiteboard: Checkpoint 2: Faith/Fruit (Titus 2:2-7)]`
    3.  **Speech:** Do my words align with Titus 2:8 and Ephesians 4:29? `[Whiteboard: Checkpoint 3: Speech (Titus 2:8, Eph 4:29)]`
*   **Bridging to Practice:** This isn't about perfection, but direction. Are we *growing* in soundness?
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from James 1:19, 22):**
    1.  Be swift to hear God's Word (sound doctrine).
    2.  Be slow to speak (cultivating sound speech).
    3.  Be slow to cling to wrong ideas/anger (submit to sound doctrine).
    4.  Be a doer of the Word, not just a hearer (live out sound faith).
*   **Invitation:** Let's commit to seeking the Lord for true spiritual health, asking the Holy Spirit to align our beliefs, character, and speech with His sound Word. Seek His conviction and power for growth.
*   **Final Prayer**
