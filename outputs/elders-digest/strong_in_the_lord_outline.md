### Introduction (5 min)
-   Hook: Acknowledge universal feelings of inadequacy, weakness, being overwhelmed.
-   Introduce Central Verse: Ephesians 6:10 - God's call to strength.
-   Thesis: True spiritual strength isn't inherent or self-generated; it's a divine gift, accessed through dependence on God, specifically through the power of the Holy Spirit.
-   Purpose: To explore from Scripture *how* to be strong *in the Lord*.

### Section 1: The Command & Our Insufficiency (Eph 6:10) (10 min)
-   **Focus Verse: Ephesians 6:10**
    -   "Be strong" - Not a suggestion, but a divine command. Implies possibility.
    -   "IN THE LORD" - The crucial qualifier. Location and source of strength.
    -   `[Write on board: Eph 6:10 - "Be Strong IN THE LORD"]`
-   **Contrast: Human Resources**
    -   Education, finances, natural talents, friendships – valuable, but insufficient for spiritual life/warfare.
    -   Jeremiah 17:5 - Curse on trusting man.
    -   `[Write on board: Human Strength (Limited) vs. Divine Strength (Unlimited)]`
    -   Why are our best efforts inadequate for overcoming sin or fulfilling God's purpose? **(RQ)**
-   **The Need:** Recognition of personal weakness is the first step to receiving God's power.
    -   We need a strength *outside* of ourselves.

### Section 2: The Divine Source: Christ & The Spirit [*] (12 min)
-   **The Channel: Through Christ**
    -   Philippians 4:13 - "I can do all things *through Christ* which strengtheneth me."
    -   Christ is the mediator of God's power.
    -   `[Write on board: Source = CHRIST (Phil 4:13)]`
-   **The Agent: The Holy Spirit**
    -   How does Christ impart strength? Via the Holy Spirit.
    -   Ephesians 5:18 - Command: "Be filled with the Spirit."
        -   Not a one-time event, but a continuous state of yieldedness.
        -   `[Write: Command = Be FILLED (Eph 5:18)]`
    -   The Spirit as a Gift & Promise:
        -   Acts 2:38 - "receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
        -   Galatians 3:14 - "receive the promise of the Spirit through faith."
        -   `[Write: Holy Spirit = Gift & Promise (Acts 2:38, Gal 3:14)]`
    -   Nature of the Spirit's Presence (EGW, MYP 107 connection):
        -   Personal (He dwells within - Rom 8:11)
        -   Present (Always available)
        -   Precious (God's chosen representative)
        -   Permanent (Abides forever - John 14:16, though dependent on our reception)
        -   Powerful (Enables obedience, witness - Rom 8:14, Acts 1:8)
    -   `[Aside: "The Holy Spirit isn't just an abstract force, but the personal presence of God dwelling within the yielded heart. It's like having direct access to the throne room, not just receiving messages from afar."]`
    -   How do we cultivate being 'filled'? **(RQ)** (Connect to prayer, Bible study, surrender, obedience).

    -   When have you felt weakest, only to see God provide unexpected strength? **(RQ)**
-   **Overcoming Fear & Timidity:**
    -   2 Timothy 1:7 - "God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
    -   Divine strength counters fear with divine resources.
    -   `[Write: Spirit gives: POWER (over sin/self), LOVE (for God/others), SOUND MIND (clarity/stability) (2 Tim 1:7)]`
-   **Practical Help in Daily Life:**
    -   Romans 8:26 - Spirit helps our infirmities (weaknesses), intercedes in prayer.
    -   He empowers us for duties, challenges, witnessing.
    -   `[Metaphor (from Rom 8:26): The Spirit is like a skilled guide helping us navigate difficult terrain we couldn't manage alone, even knowing the right path to plead before God.]`

    -   This strength isn't just for crisis, but for daily sanctification – reflecting Christ's character.
    -   Enables effective service and witness.
    -   How does relying on *His* strength change how we approach daily responsibilities or difficult relationships? **(RQ)**
