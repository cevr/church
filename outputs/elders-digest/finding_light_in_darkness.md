### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with the feeling - "It's so dark!" Describe the
  emotional/spiritual darkness of deep sorrow, loss, grief.
- Relatability: Everyone experiences 'dark nights of the soul'.
- **The Need/Question:** Where is God when it hurts so much? How can we find
  peace in overwhelming darkness? **(RQ)**
- Introduce Central Verse (2 Cor 1:3-4): God _is_ the God of all comfort.
- **Goal:** To explore _from Scripture_ how God meets us in our darkest times,
  offering comfort, presence, and light, building our reliance on Him.
- [Write on board: DARKNESS (Grief/Sorrow) -> Where is God?]

### Section 1: Acknowledging the Darkness (Psalm 23:4) (8 min) [*]

- **Focus Verse:** Psalm 23:4 - "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
  shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
  staff they comfort me."
- **Biblical Principle:** God doesn't promise _absence_ of darkness, but His
  _presence_ within it.
  - It's a 'walk _through_', not a permanent residence (Ps 23:4a).
  - The 'shadow' implies the substance (death/evil) is real, but God's presence
    overcomes the fear (Ps 23:4b).
- **Whiteboard:** [Write: Psalm 23:4 -> Valley of Shadow -> FEAR NO EVIL -> WHY?
  -> "Thou art with me"]
- **The Shepherd's Tools:** (Ps 23:4c)
  - Rod (Protection/Guidance)
  - Staff (Support/Rescue)
  - These represent God's active care _in_ the darkness.
- **Character Building Link:** Learning to trust His presence even when we can't
  see the path (based on Ps 23:4). Reliance, not self-sufficiency.
- **Rhetorical Question:** How does knowing God walks _with_ us change how we
  face the valley? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Source of Comfort (2 Cor 1:3-4) (8 min) [*]

- **Focus Verse:** 2 Cor 1:3-4 (Central Verse revisited)
- **Biblical Principle:** God is the _source_ ("Father of mercies, God of all
  comfort" - v. 3). Comfort isn't just sympathy; it's divine strengthening.
  - He comforts us _in_ all tribulation (v. 4a) (not necessarily _from_ it
    immediately).
- **Whiteboard:** [Write: 2 Cor 1:3 -> God = Father of Mercies + God of ALL
  Comfort]
- **Purpose of Comfort:** "...that we may be able to comfort them..." (v. 4b)
  - Our experience of God's comfort equips us to minister to others.
  - Turns pain into purpose (derived from v. 4b).
- **Character Building Link:** Developing empathy and compassion through shared
  experience (v. 4b), reflecting God's character (v. 3).
- **Aside:**
  `[Aside: Sometimes we feel isolated in grief, but the comfort God gives us (2 Cor 1:4) is meant to ripple outwards. It connects us to Him and then through Him, to others who are hurting. Our church family becomes a conduit for that divine comfort, sharing what we ourselves have received.]`
- **Rhetorical Question:** Have we recognized the comfort received (2 Cor 1:4)
  as a resource to share? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: Jesus, The Light in Darkness (John 8:12; Isaiah 41:10) (8 min) [*]

- **The Problem:** Darkness = disorientation, fear, inability to see clearly.
- **Focus Verse 1:** John 8:12 - "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am
  the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but
  shall have the light of life."
  - **Biblical Principle:** Jesus _is_ the light (John 8:12a). Following Him
    provides direction and dispels spiritual darkness (John 8:12b).
  - This isn't just future hope, but present reality ("shall not walk...").
- **Whiteboard:** [Draw simple diagram: Darkness -> Follow Jesus (John 8:12) ->
  Light of Life]
- **Focus Verse 2:** Isaiah 41:10 - "Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not
  dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee;
  yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness."
  - **Biblical Principle:** God's presence ("I am with thee" - Isa 41:10a)
    banishes fear and brings strength.
  - Direct command: "Fear not... be not dismayed" (Isa 41:10a).
  - Promises: Strengthen, Help, Uphold (Isa 41:10b).
- **Whiteboard:** [Write: Isaiah 41:10 -> I AM WITH THEE -> No Fear/Dismay ->
  Strength/Help/Uphold]
- **Illustrative Concept (Analogy):**
  `[Analogy (from John 8:12): Navigating a pitch-black room. Panic vs. Following someone with a flashlight (Jesus). You still experience the darkness, but you have guidance and assurance because He is the Light.]`
- **Character Building Link:** Shifting focus from the darkness (circumstances)
  to the Light (Jesus - John 8:12) and His promises (Isaiah 41:10). Active
  faith.

### Section 4: The Promise of Morning & Practical Steps (Psalm 30:5) (8 min)

- **Focus Verse:** Psalm 30:5 - "For his anger endureth but a moment; in his
  favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the
  morning."
  - **Biblical Principle:** Sorrow is temporary ("a night" - Ps 30:5b) in the
    light of God's eternal favor ("in his favour is life" - Ps 30:5a) and plan.
    There is hope ("joy cometh in the morning" - Ps 30:5b) beyond the present
    darkness.
  - Not minimizing the pain of the 'night', but affirming the certainty of God's
    'morning'.
- **Whiteboard:** [Write: Psalm 30:5 -> Weeping (Night) vs. Joy (Morning) ->
  God's Favor = Life]
- **Bridging to Practice:** How do we live _now_, in the 'night', holding onto
  the promise of 'morning' (Ps 30:5)?
  - **Actionable Step 1 (Childlike Trust):** Consciously choose to trust God's
    presence _today_, even without understanding (Proverbs 3:5-6). Verbalize
    trust in prayer. [Link to Ps 23:4]
  - **Actionable Step 2 (Cling to the Light):** Immerse in Scripture, especially
    promises of God's presence and faithfulness (Isa 41:10). Let His Word be the
    light source. [Link to John 8:12]
  - **Actionable Step 3 (Receive & Share Comfort):** Accept God's comfort
    through His Word, Spirit, and people. Look for opportunities to share that
    comfort. [Link to 2 Cor 1:4]
  - **Actionable Step 4 (Hold onto Hope):** Remind yourself of the 'morning'
    promised in Christ (Ps 30:5). Focus on eternal realities.
- **Character Building Link:** Endurance, hope, and faith developed _through_
  trials (based on the need for these steps), not in their absence. Becoming
  resilient in God.
- **Aside:**
  `[Aside: Building character through trials is like a blacksmith forging steel. The fire and hammering (our 'nights' of weeping - Ps 30:5) are intense, seemingly destructive, but they ultimately shape something strong and useful. God uses the 'darkness' not to destroy us, but to refine our faith (1 Pet 1:7) and shape us into His image.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** Darkness is real, but God's presence (Ps 23:4), comfort (2 Cor
  1:3-4), light (John 8:12), strength (Isa 41:10), and promised joy (Ps 30:5)
  are greater.
- **Central Message:** Don't navigate darkness alone. Trust the Father of
  mercies (2 Cor 1:3), follow the Light of the world (John 8:12).
- **Character Focus:** True peace isn't absence of storms, but Christ's presence
  _in_ the storm (Mark 4:38-39). Reliance on Him builds enduring character.
- **Invitation:**
  - For those in darkness: Will you reach out and grasp the hand of the
    Comforter (2 Cor 1:3) today? Will you choose to follow the Light (John
    8:12)? **(RQ)**
  - For all: Will you commit to trusting His presence (Ps 23:4), receiving His
    comfort (2 Cor 1:4), and sharing it with others, allowing Him to build your
    character through every season?
- **Final Prayer:** Focus on trusting God's presence and light in times of
  sorrow, asking for strength (Isa 41:10) and hope (Ps 30:5).
