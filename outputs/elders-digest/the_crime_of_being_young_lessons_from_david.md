### Introduction (5 min)
-   Hook: The world often dismisses youth - the idea of the "crime of being young."
-   Acknowledge historical tension: Older generations sometimes misunderstand/underestimate younger ones.
-   Transition: Introduce David – a youth who defied expectations, not seen as ready by men, but chosen by God.
-   Purpose: Explore David's early life (1 Samuel 17) to learn God's perspective on youth, faithfulness, and courage.
-   [Whiteboard: Title - "The 'Crime' of Being Young? Lessons from David"]
-   Focus: How God prepares and uses those the world overlooks.

### Main Content 1: Preparation in Obscurity (10 min)
-   **Focus:** David's faithfulness as a shepherd prepared him.
-   **Biblical Basis:** David's own testimony about protecting sheep.
    -   Read/Explain: 1 Samuel 17:34-37. David recounts fighting lion/bear.
    -   Point: Faithfulness in small, unseen duties builds character and skill for future challenges. (Luke 16:10)
    -   [Whiteboard: Faithfulness (Shepherd - 1 Sam 17:34-37) -> Preparation (Goliath)]
-   **Context:** David wasn't idle; he was developing skills and reliance on God. (Psalm 78:70-72)
-   **(RQ):** How seriously do we take our 'small' duties today? Do we see God's training in them? (Based on Luke 16:10)
-   **Application:** Diligence in school, work, home responsibilities is God's training ground.
-   [Brief Illustration Concept (from 1 Sam 17:34-37): David's shepherd skills (sling accuracy, courage facing predators) were the very tools God used against Goliath. Our 'mundane' skills, when developed faithfully, can be consecrated for God's service.]

### Main Content 2: Earnestness & Righteous Indignation [*] (12 min)
-   **Focus:** David's reaction to Goliath's defiance reveals godly character.
-   **Biblical Basis:** David's questions and response to the situation.
    -   Read/Explain: 1 Samuel 17:26 - David hears Goliath's defiance.
    -   Point: David shows *righteous indignation* – anger focused on God's dishonor, not personal insult. [Whiteboard: Godly Anger (1 Sam 17:26 - Defiance of God) vs. Worldly Fear]
    -   Read/Explain: 1 Samuel 17:29 - David responds to his brother's criticism.
    -   Point: David's earnestness - "Is there not a cause?" He saw the spiritual significance others missed. He was serious about God's honor.
-   **(RQ):** What issues today should stir righteous indignation in us because God's name or law is defied? (Connecting 1 Sam 17:26 to modern challenges to faith/morality).
-   **(RQ):** Are we earnest about God's cause, or passive bystanders when truth is challenged? (Reflecting on 1 Sam 17:29).
-   [Aside: Like David seeing Goliath's defiance not just as a military threat but an insult to the living God, we should view attacks on biblical truth or morality today as serious matters requiring a thoughtful, faith-filled response, not fearful silence or apathy.]
-   **Application:** Youth (and all believers) need to be spiritually aware, concerned for God's honor, and earnest about His truth.

### Main Content 3: Courage Born of Faith (12 min)
-   **Focus:** David's courage stemmed from his relationship with God.
-   **Biblical Basis:** David's confrontation with Goliath.
    -   Read/Explain: 1 Samuel 17:37 - David recalls past deliverances as basis for present faith.
    -   Point: Confidence based on God's proven faithfulness. [Whiteboard: Past Deliverance (1 Sam 17:37) -> Present Faith]
    -   Read/Explain: 1 Samuel 17:45-47 - David's declaration before fighting.
    -   Point: True courage is acting in God's name and power, for His glory. [Whiteboard: Courage = Faith in GOD (1 Sam 17:45) NOT Self/Armor (1 Sam 17:38-40)]
    -   Contrast: Saul offered armor (human solution, 1 Sam 17:38-39), David rejected it for reliance on God (1 Sam 17:40, 45).
-   **(RQ):** When facing our 'Goliaths' (fear, temptation, opposition), where does our confidence truly lie – in human strategies or God's power? (Based on 1 Sam 17:45, 47).
-   [Analogy (from 1 Sam 17:47): "The battle is the Lord's" - like a child holding their father's strong hand while walking through a dark place, our courage comes not from our strength, but His presence and power.]
-   **Application:** Youth are called to confront challenges (peer pressure, secularism, moral relativism) with courage rooted in active faith in God.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   **Recap:** David's youth wasn't a crime; it was a stage for demonstrating faithfulness (shepherd), earnestness (cause), righteous indignation (defiance), and courage (faith in God).
-   **Connection:** These are qualities God desires in His people today, regardless of age. (Ref. 1 Timothy 4:12 - "Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example...")
-   **Challenge:** Don't accept the world's low expectations. Embrace God's high calling to be faithful, earnest, and courageous *now*.
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Study):**
    -   1.  **Be Faithful Now:** View current duties as God's training ground. (Luke 16:10) [Whiteboard: Action 1: Faithfulness in the 'Small']
    -   2.  **Be Earnest for God:** Ask God for a heart concerned for His honor and cause. (1 Sam 17:26, 29) [Whiteboard: Action 2: Earnestness for His Cause]
    -   3.  **Be Courageous through Faith:** Face challenges trusting God's power, recalling His faithfulness. (1 Sam 17:45, 47) [Whiteboard: Action 3: Courage via Faith]
-   **Final Appeal:** Will you commit to being a 'David' for God in your generation? Young, perhaps underestimated, but ready to stand faithfully and courageously for Him?
-   **Closing Prayer:** Ask for faithfulness, earnestness, and courage for all, especially the youth.
