### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with a question: When was the last time you intentionally shared your faith with someone outside church walls? **(RQ)**
-   **Relevance:** Personal connection is God's chosen method. We are His hands and feet.
-   **The Need:** Many are searching but don't know where to look. Our lives can be signposts.
-   **Outline Preview:** Today, we'll explore practical, biblical principles for personal evangelism, drawing heavily from Christ's example.
-   **Introduce Central Verse:** John 4:35 - The fields are ready *now*. [Write on board: John 4:35 - FIELDS WHITE ALREADY]

### Section 1: Christ's Method - Intentional Connection (10 min)

-   **Principle:** Evangelism starts with intentional, barrier-crossing contact.
-   **Biblical Example: Jesus at the Well (John 4:7-9)**
    -   He initiated: Went where people were (Samaria).
    -   He spoke first: Asked for a drink (simple, human need).
    -   He crossed barriers: Jew/Samaritan, Man/Woman, Rabbi/Outcast. [Write on board: Barriers Crossed (John 4:7-9): Social, Racial, Gender]
    -   **(RQ)** How often do our own prejudices or comfort zones prevent us from initiating contact like Jesus did?
-   **Principle:** Build rapport by finding common ground.
-   **Biblical Example: Paul at Mars Hill (Acts 17:22-28)**
    -   Observed their culture ('very religious').
    -   Found a point of connection ('Unknown God'). [Write on board: Acts 17:22-28 - Find Common Ground]
    -   Used their own poets to build a bridge.
    -   **(RQ)** What 'altars' or points of common interest can we find in conversations today to build bridges?
-   **Practical Steps:** Be observant, listen more than speak initially, show genuine interest in others.

### Section 2: Cultivating Interest & Understanding (12 min) [*]

-   **Principle:** Arouse spiritual interest through kindness, godly example, and guiding conversation.
-   **Biblical Example: The 'Living Water' (John 4:10-14)**
    -   Jesus shifted from physical thirst to spiritual thirst. [Write on board: Physical Need -> Spiritual Truth (John 4:10)]
    -   Offered something better ('living water').
    -   Created curiosity and desire. [Write Question on board: How can our lives/words make others thirsty for 'living water'?]
    -   **(RQ)** Based on John 4:10-14, how did Jesus pique her interest without being forceful?
-   **Kindness & Example:** Our actions often speak louder initially (Matt 5:16).
-   **Principle:** Present truth progressively, according to readiness.
-   **Biblical Teaching: Milk Before Meat (1 Corinthians 3:1-2; Hebrews 5:12-14)**
    -   Start with foundational truths (God's love, sin, salvation through Christ).
    -   Discern the hearer's capacity. [Write on board: 1 Cor 3:1-2 - Milk -> Meat]
    -   [Analogy (from 1 Cor 3): Building a spiritual house requires a foundation before the walls go up.]
    -   **(RQ)** Are we sometimes guilty of overwhelming new seekers with 'meat' when they need 'milk'?
-   **Practical Steps:** Pray for wisdom, listen carefully to questions/responses, start with the Gospel basics.

### Section 3: Presenting the Core Truth (12 min)

-   **Principle:** Avoid unnecessary condemnation; focus on God's desire for salvation.
-   **Biblical Foundation: God's Purpose (John 3:17)**
    -   "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved." [Write on board: John 3:17 - SAVE, not Condemn]
    -   While truth exposes sin (John 16:8), the goal is reconciliation, not judgment.
    -   **(RQ)** How can we present truth about sin and judgment in a way that reflects God's saving purpose (John 3:17)?
-   **Principle:** Maintain focus on the core message: Christ and Him crucified.
-   **Biblical Mandate: Paul's Focus (1 Corinthians 2:2)**
    -   "For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified." [Write on board: 1 Cor 2:2 - FOCUS = Christ Crucified]
    -   Avoid getting sidetracked by secondary issues or arguments.
    -   The power is in the Gospel message itself (Rom 1:16).
-   **Principle:** Directly present Christ and His claims when groundwork is laid.
-   **Biblical Example: The Reveal (John 4:25-26)**
    -   After building rapport and addressing her need, Jesus clearly identified Himself as the Messiah.
    -   There comes a time for a clear call to decision.
    -   [Aside: Like a doctor diagnosing an illness before prescribing the cure, we must gently help people see their need before presenting Christ as the only remedy.]
-   **Practical Steps:** Keep Christ central, share personal testimony of His power, gently guide towards a decision for Him.

### Conclusion: The Urgency and Ripple Effect (6 min)

-   **Recap:** We've seen Christ's method: Intentional contact, finding common ground, arousing interest, progressive truth, focusing on salvation in Christ.
-   **The Potential Impact: One Becomes Many (John 4:39-42)**
    -   The Samaritan woman's testimony brought her whole town to Jesus. [Write on board: John 4:39 - One -> Many]
    -   Never underestimate the influence of one transformed life.
    -   [Aside: Our personal witness is like planting a seed; God gives the increase, often in ways we don't expect, multiplying the harvest far beyond our initial effort.]
-   **The Urgency: Fields Are White Now (John 4:35)**
    -   Revisit the central verse. The time for sharing is *now*.
    -   Opportunities surround us daily.
    -   **(RQ)** Seeing the fields are white (John 4:35), what specific step will you take *this week* to engage in personal evangelism?
-   **Final Appeal:** Let's commit to following Christ's method, empowered by His Spirit, to reach those He longs to save. Pray for divine appointments and the courage to speak.
