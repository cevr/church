### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Prayer
- Jesus: Giver of Gifts (Eph 4:8). His greatest gift?
- Introduce the Holy Spirit as this supreme gift.
- Read Central Verse: John 14:16-17.
  - `[Whiteboard: John 14:16-17 - "Another Comforter" = Holy Spirit]`
- Purpose: Understand _who_ the Holy Spirit is and His vital work _in us_ based
  on Scripture.

### Section 1: The Promised Person (10 min)

- **The Promise Fulfilled:** Jesus promised "another Comforter" (John 14:16).
  - Greek 'Parakletos': One called alongside to help.
    `[Whiteboard: Parakletos = Helper, Advocate, Comforter]`
  - Not an impersonal force, but a Person.
- **Divine Personality:**
  - He can be grieved: Ephesians 4:30 - "And grieve not the holy Spirit of
    God..."
    - **(RQ)** How does our conduct affect a Person who can be grieved?
    - `[Whiteboard: Eph 4:30 - Spirit can be GRIEVED = Personality]`
  - He can be lied to: Acts 5:3-4 (Ananias & Sapphira) - Lied to Holy Spirit =
    Lied to God.
    - Confirms personality and divinity.
  - He teaches (John 14:26), guides (John 16:13), speaks (Acts 13:2), intercedes
    (Rom 8:26).
- **Co-Equal Deity:**
  - Mentioned with Father & Son (Matt 28:19).
  - Called "God" (Acts 5:4).
  - Eternal (Heb 9:14), Omnipresent (Ps 139:7).
- **Significance:** We relate to a Person who dwells _in_ us permanently (John
  14:17).

### Section 2: The Spirit's Work in the World [*] (12 min)

- **Jesus Explains the Spirit's Mission:** John 16:7-11 - The Comforter will
  "reprove [convict] the world..."
  - `[Whiteboard: John 16:8 - CONVICT: Sin, Righteousness, Judgment]`
- **Conviction of Sin (v. 9):** "...because they believe not on me."
  - Root sin = Unbelief in Christ. Spirit exposes need for Jesus.
  - **(RQ)** How does the Spirit bring this conviction today? (Word, testimony,
    circumstances).
- **Conviction of Righteousness (v. 10):** "...because I go to my Father..."
  - Christ's ascension proves His righteousness. He is the standard.
  - Spirit shows world's lack of righteousness outside Christ.
  - `[Aside: Like a perfect plumb line held against a crooked wall, Christ's righteousness, revealed by the Spirit, exposes our own leaning structures.]`
- **Conviction of Judgment (v. 11):** "...because the prince of this world is
  judged."
  - Satan's defeat assures future judgment.
  - Spirit warns of accountability.
  - Connection to Investigative Judgment: Spirit prepares hearts for God's
    justice. `[Whiteboard: Judgment -> Accountability (Investigative Judgment)]`
- **Relevance to Evangelism/3 Angels:** Conviction is groundwork for receiving
  Gospel/final messages.

### Section 3: The Spirit's Work in the Believer (12 min)

- **Indwelling Presence:** He lives _in_ the believer (John 14:17; 1 Cor 6:19).
- **Instruction in Truth:** John 16:13 - "He will guide you into all truth."
  - Illuminates Scripture, reveals God's will.
  - **(RQ)** Are we asking the Spirit to teach us as we study?
- **Infilling for Power & Character:** Ephesians 5:18 - "...be filled with the
  Spirit;"
  - Continuous command/experience.
    `[Whiteboard: Eph 5:18 - BE FILLED (Continuous)]`
  - Contrast: Worldly vs. Divine influence.
  - Purpose: Fruit (Gal 5:22-23), holy living.
  - Connection to Last Generation: Essential for reflecting Christ's character.
    `[Whiteboard: Filled -> Fruit -> Character (Last Gen)]`
- **Enabling for Service:** Acts 1:8 - "But ye shall receive power... ye shall
  be witnesses..."
  - `[Whiteboard: Acts 1:8 - POWER -> WITNESS]`
  - Power for _witnessing_.
  - Connection to Evangelism/3 Angels: Equips for sharing Gospel/present truth.
  - `[Analogy (from Acts 1:8): Like plugging in an appliance - the Spirit connects us to God's power for His work.]`
- **Encouraging & Helping:** Romans 8:14, 26 - "...led by the Spirit... Spirit
  also helpeth our infirmities..."
  - He guides (v. 14), helps in weakness, intercedes (v. 26). The Comforter in
    action.
  - `[Aside: Sometimes the Christian life feels like navigating a dense fog. The Holy Spirit isn't a map we consult occasionally; He's the personal guide walking beside us, whispering the next safe step, even when the path ahead is unclear.]`
- **Dependence:** We need Him for everything spiritual (John 15:5).

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Holy Spirit = God, Person, Jesus' Gift. Convicts world, works _in_
  believers (indwells, teaches, fills, empowers, helps).
- **The Need:** Recognize His personality & vital role. Christian life
  impossible without Him.
- **Practical Response (Based on Study):**
  - Acknowledge His presence daily (John 14:17).
  - Yield to His conviction (John 16:8). `[Whiteboard: Yield]`
  - Seek His instruction in God's Word (John 16:13).
    `[Whiteboard: Seek Instruction]`
  - Pray to be continually filled (Eph 5:18). `[Whiteboard: Ask for Filling]`
  - Rely on His power for witness & overcoming (Acts 1:8; Rom 8:26).
    `[Whiteboard: Rely]`
  - Don't grieve Him (Eph 4:30).
- **Final Thought:** Jesus gave His Spirit so we can be empowered children
  reflecting His character and finishing His work.
- **Call to Prayer:** Silent prayer to yield to the Spirit, followed by closing
  prayer.
