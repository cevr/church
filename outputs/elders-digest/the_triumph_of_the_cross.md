### Introduction (5 min)
- The cross: Stumbling block? Foolishness? Or the power of God? (1 Cor 1:18, 23)
- Centrality of the cross in God's plan of redemption.
- Historical context: Early challenges to Christ's nature (Docetism/Gnosticism) – why understanding *who* died is crucial.
- Today's goal: Explore the profound victory achieved at Calvary through key scriptures.
- **(RQ)** What does the 'triumph of the cross' truly mean for us personally?

### Section 1: The Victor: Fully God, Fully Man, Supreme Lord (10 min)
- **Who hung on the cross? Not merely a good man.**
    - **Fully God, Fully Man:** Colossians 2:9 - "For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily."
        - `[Whiteboard: Col 2:9 - Fully God | Fully Man]`
        - Importance: Only a divine-human Saviour could bridge the gap, satisfy justice, and represent humanity.
        - Countering ancient/modern errors diminishing Christ's nature.
    - **Supreme Creator & Head:** Colossians 1:15-18 - Image of the invisible God, firstborn of creation, creator of all, head of the church.
        - `[Whiteboard: Col 1:15-18 - Creator | Sustainer | Head of Church]`
        - His authority establishes the significance of His sacrifice.
        - **(RQ)** If Christ created *all* things, including angelic powers (v.16), what does that tell us about His authority over them, even at the cross? (RQ)

### Section 2: The Event: Atonement & Reconciliation [*] (12 min)
- **What actually happened at the cross? More than just a death.**
    - **Literal, Historical Event:** 1 Corinthians 15:3b - "...how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures..."
        - Grounded in history, not myth.
    - **The Purpose: Reconciliation:** Colossians 1:20 - "And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself..."
        - `[Whiteboard: Cross (Col 1:20) -> Peace -> Reconciliation]`
        - Sin caused separation; the cross enables reconciliation with God.
    - **The Means: Atonement & Cleansing:** 1 John 1:7b - "...the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
        - `[Whiteboard: Blood of Jesus (1 John 1:7b) = Cleansing from ALL sin]`
        - The price was paid; purification is available.
        - [Analogy (from finance): Like a debt completely cleared from the books by a sufficient payment.]
    - **(RQ)** How does viewing the cross as God's chosen method for peace and cleansing impact how we approach Him when we sin? (RQ)

### Section 3: The Victory: Forgiveness, Freedom, Dominion (12 min)
- **What did the cross accomplish legally and spiritually?**
    - **Forgiveness & New Life:** Colossians 2:13 - "And you, being dead in your sins... hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
        - `[Whiteboard: Col 2:13 - Dead in Sin -> Forgiven -> Made Alive with Christ]`
        - Personal application: Faith accepts this gift.
    - **Cancellation of Condemnation:** Colossians 2:14 - "Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us... took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
        - `[Whiteboard: Col 2:14 - Handwriting (Law's Condemnation) -> NAILED TO CROSS -> Cancelled]`
        - The law's just demands against the sinner are met in Christ. This *is* justification by faith demonstrated.
        - **(RQ)** What does it mean practically that the record of debt is 'nailed to the cross'? How should this affect guilt and assurance? (RQ)
    - **Victory Over Evil Powers:** Colossians 2:15 - "And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
        - `[Whiteboard: Col 2:15 - Christ Spoils & Triumphs Over Evil Powers]`
        - The Great Controversy perspective: The cross was Satan's apparent victory turned into his ultimate defeat.
        - Christ disarmed the enemy forces publicly.
        - [Aside: *Think about the cosmic courtroom scene implied here. Satan accuses, the law condemns, but the cross declares 'Paid in Full!' It's a legal and spiritual victory with eternal consequences, secured by Christ's sacrifice, openly displayed before the universe.*]

### Conclusion: Living in the Triumph (6 min)
- **Recap:** The cross wasn't a defeat, but the ultimate triumph.
    - Christ (God-Man, Supreme Lord) died historically (Col 1:20, 1 Cor 15:3b).
    - Accomplished: Reconciliation (Col 1:20), Cleansing (1 John 1:7b), Forgiveness (Col 2:13), Cancellation of Debt (Col 2:14), Victory over Evil (Col 2:15).
- **Our Response: Live the Victory.**
    - Romans 6:2b - "How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
        - `[Whiteboard: Question (Rom 6:2b): Dead to Sin -> How Live?]`
        - The victory *over* sin leads to a life lived *free from* sin's dominion.
        - This isn't earning salvation, but living out the reality of the salvation already won and freely given.
    - **(RQ)** Since Christ triumphed over sin and Satan, how can we practically walk in that victory daily? (RQ)
- **Practical Application: Action Steps from the Text**
    - **Need/Question (from text):** Given Christ's victory and our new life (Col 2:13-15), how do we live differently (Rom 6:2b)?
    - **Biblical Principle (from text):** Christ's triumph provides forgiveness (Col 2:13), cancels condemnation (Col 2:14), defeats evil powers (Col 2:15), and makes us dead to sin's dominion (Rom 6:2b).
    - **Bridging (from text):** This victory has daily implications for how we face guilt, temptation, and our identity in Christ.
    - **Actionable Steps (from text):**
        1.  **Recall Colossians 2:14:** When feelings of guilt for *forgiven* sins arise, consciously bring Colossians 2:14 to mind ("nailed to the cross") and thank God for His complete forgiveness.
        2.  **Claim Victory in Temptation:** When tempted, pause and verbally or mentally claim the victory Christ won (Col 2:15), asking for His strength to walk as one dead to sin (Rom 6:2b).
        3.  **Live the New Life:** Identify one specific habit or attitude rooted in your "old self" (dead in sins, Col 2:13) and ask God this week to help you replace it with a practice reflecting your new life in Christ.
- **Invitation:** Choose today to fully accept Christ's finished work and actively live in the freedom and power His triumph provides. Commit to applying these steps this week.
