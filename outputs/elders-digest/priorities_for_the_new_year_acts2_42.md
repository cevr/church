### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & New Year Context: Common focus on resolutions (health, finances,
  etc.), often superficial or self-focused.
- What are _God's_ priorities for His people, timelessly? Where should our focus
  be for genuine growth?
- Introduce Acts 2:42 - A divine blueprint for the thriving early church.
  - Context: Post-Pentecost, outpouring of the Spirit, rapid growth (Acts 2:41).
  - These weren't suggestions, but the _foundation_ of their vibrant spiritual
    life, empowered by the Holy Spirit.
- **Central Question:** How can we make these four ancient priorities the
  bedrock of _our_ spiritual lives this year, reflecting the early church's
  devotion? `[Write on board: Acts 2:42 - Blueprint for Spiritual Life]`
  `[Write: 1. Doctrine 2. Fellowship 3. Breaking Bread 4. Prayers]`

### 1. Apostles' Doctrine (Bible Study) (10 min)

- **Need/Question:** In a world of conflicting ideas and "fake news," where do
  we find reliable truth? How do we grow spiritually and avoid deception?
  **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (Acts 2:42a):** "They continued stedfastly in the
  apostles' doctrine..."
  - What _is_ the "apostles' doctrine"? It's the teachings of Christ passed on
    through those He commissioned (Matthew 28:19-20), now preserved for us in
    Scripture.
  - Why is doctrine essential? It grounds our faith and practice. (2 Timothy
    3:16 - "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
    doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:")
  - It equips us for service and maturity (2 Timothy 3:17 - "That the man of God
    may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.")
  - Truth sanctifies us (John 17:17 - "Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word
    is truth.") `[Write on board: Doctrine = God's Truth (Bible)]`
- **Bridging:** Just as the early church devoted themselves to understanding
  God's truth through the apostles, we must prioritize deep, consistent Bible
  study. It's not just academic; it's life-transforming.
- **Illustration:** Think of doctrine like the foundation of a house. Without a
  solid foundation (God's Word), everything built upon it (our experience,
  feelings, actions) is unstable and prone to collapse when storms come (Matthew
  7:24-27).
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  Commit to daily personal Bible study (Acts 17:11).
  2.  Actively participate in Sabbath School/Bible study groups.
  3.  Measure all teachings against the clear word of God (Isaiah 8:20).
- **Invitation:** Will you commit this year to "continue stedfastly" in God's
  Word?

### 2. Fellowship (Koinonia) (8 min) [*]

- **Need/Question:** We live in an increasingly isolated world. How does God
  intend for believers to relate to each other? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (Acts 2:42b):** "...and fellowship..." (Greek:
  _koinonia_ - sharing, partnership, community).
  - This wasn't just casual socializing; it was deep spiritual connection and
    mutual support.
  - It involves encouraging one another toward love and good works (Hebrews
    10:24 - "And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good
    works:")
  - It requires intentional gathering (Hebrews 10:25a - "Not forsaking the
    assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is...")
  - Why? For mutual exhortation, especially as Christ's return nears (Hebrews
    10:25b - "...but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the
    day approaching.") `[Write on board: Fellowship = Shared Life in Christ]`
- **Bridging:** True Christian fellowship goes beyond potlucks; it's bearing
  burdens (Galatians 6:2), praying for each other (James 5:16), and building
  each other up in faith (1 Thessalonians 5:11).
- `[Aside: The Greek word 'koinonia' implies more than just friendship; it's a shared participation in something sacred – in this case, life in Christ through the Spirit. It's about shared identity and purpose.]`
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  Prioritize attending church services and small groups (Hebrews 10:25).
  2.  Intentionally connect with fellow believers during the week (phone call,
      visit, prayer).
  3.  Look for ways to encourage and support others in the church family
      (Hebrews 10:24).
- **Invitation:** How can you deepen your _koinonia_ this year?

### 3. Breaking of Bread (Remembering Christ) (8 min)

- **Need/Question:** How do we keep the sacrifice of Christ central to our faith
  and avoid taking it for granted?
- **Biblical Principle (Acts 2:42c):** "...and in breaking of bread..."
  - This refers primarily to the Lord's Supper (Communion), a sacred ordinance
    instituted by Christ (Luke 22:19-20).
  - It's a proclamation of Christ's death (1 Corinthians 11:26 - "For as often
    as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew [proclaim] the Lord's
    death till he come.")
  - It requires self-examination and reverence (1 Corinthians 11:28 - "But let a
    man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that
    cup.")
    `[Write on board: Breaking Bread = Remembering & Proclaiming Christ's Sacrifice]`
- **Bridging:** Participating in the ordinance of humility and the Lord's Supper
  isn't just ritual; it's a vital, regular reminder of the cost of our salvation
  and our unity in Christ. It refocuses us on the Gospel.
- **Rhetorical Question:** When we partake, are we truly remembering His
  sacrifice and examining our own hearts? **(RQ)**
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  Prepare prayerfully for Communion services (1 Cor 11:28).
  2.  Participate with reverence and focus on Christ's sacrifice.
  3.  Reflect regularly on the meaning of the cross in your daily life.
- **Invitation:** Let's approach the Lord's Table this year with renewed
  gratitude and commitment.

### 4. Prayers (Corporate, Personal, Family) (9 min)

- **Need/Question:** How do we access God's power, guidance, and peace in our
  lives and in the church?
- **Biblical Principle (Acts 2:42d):** "...and in prayers." (Plural - suggesting
  various forms and times of prayer).
  - Prayer was a constant feature of the early church's life (Acts 1:14, Acts
    4:24-31, Acts 12:5).
  - We are called to persistent, Spirit-led prayer (Ephesians 6:18 - "Praying
    always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching
    thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;")
  - Prayer includes adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and supplication
    (Philippians 4:6).
    `[Write on board: Prayers = Constant Communication with God]`
- **Bridging:** Prayer isn't a spare tire; it's the steering wheel. It connects
  us directly to the source of all power and wisdom. It fuels the other three
  priorities. We need personal, family, and corporate prayer.
- `[Aside: Notice the plural 'prayers'. This likely encompassed scheduled times (like the temple hours, Acts 3:1), spontaneous prayers, group prayers, and private devotion. It was woven into the fabric of their lives.]`
- **Illustration:** Prayer is like breathing for the Christian. We need it
  constantly to live spiritually. Holding our 'spiritual breath' by neglecting
  prayer leads to weakness and vulnerability (1 Thessalonians 5:17 - "Pray
  without ceasing.")
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  Establish a consistent time for personal prayer daily (Mark 1:35).
  2.  Pray _with_ your family or household.
  3.  Actively participate in corporate prayer meetings (Matthew 18:19-20).
- **Invitation:** Will you commit to making prayer a more central and consistent
  part of your life this year?

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: The early church thrived because they were devoted to these four
  God-given priorities: Word, Fellowship, Remembrance of Christ, Prayer (Acts
  2:42).
- These aren't outdated concepts; they are God's timeless plan for a vibrant,
  growing spiritual life for individuals and the church.
- **Revisit Central Question:** How can _we_ make these ancient priorities the
  bedrock of _our_ spiritual lives this year? It requires intentionality and
  dependence on the Holy Spirit, just like the early believers.
- **Challenge:** Don't settle for superficial resolutions. Choose God's
  priorities. Which of these four areas needs the most attention in your life
  right now?
- **Invitation:** Let's ask God to help us "continue stedfastly" in His Word, in
  genuine fellowship, in remembering His sacrifice, and in constant prayer. Let
  this be the foundation for a spiritually fruitful year ahead.
- Brief closing prayer asking for the Holy Spirit's help to implement these
  priorities.
