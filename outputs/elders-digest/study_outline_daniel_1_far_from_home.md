### Introduction (6 min)
*   Hook: Why study Daniel now? Relevance for the last generation facing end-time pressures.
*   Brief Overview: Daniel - A book of Prophecy, History, and profound Character lessons.
*   Core Theme Intro: The Great Controversy played out in individual lives. [Write on board: God (Jerusalem - Faithfulness) vs. Satan (Babylon - Compromise)]
*   Context: Judah's fall, captivity decreed by God due to persistent unfaithfulness (Dan 1:1-2; cf. Jer 25:8-11). Sin separates, leads to exile. We too are spiritually 'far from home' in a world opposed to God.
*   Introduce Central Verse (Dan 1:8) - The pivotal decision that set the course for Daniel's life and ministry.

### Section 1: Captivity & Context (10 min)
*   **The Setting:** Babylon - peak of worldly power, center of pagan worship and learning (Dan 1:1-2). A type of the world's allure and opposition to God.
*   **God's Sovereignty:** God *allowed* Judah's captivity and even the temple vessels to be taken (Dan 1:2). He remains in control even amidst apparent defeat caused by sin.
*   **The Pressure:** Intense program of assimilation into Babylonian culture (Dan 1:3-7).
    *   Education: Selected for intelligence to learn pagan wisdom ("learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans" - Dan 1:4). Worldly wisdom vs. God's wisdom (cf. 1 Cor 1:20-25).
    *   Names changed: Attempt to erase Hebrew identity and allegiance to Jehovah (Dan 1:6-7). [Write on board: Hebrew Names (God-focused: e.g., Daniel - God is my Judge) -> Babylonian Names (Pagan Gods: e.g., Belteshazzar - Bel's prince)].
    *   Diet Provided: King's own rich food and wine appointed for them (Dan 1:5). A seemingly small thing, but a critical test of allegiance.
*   **(RQ)** How does our modern 'Babylon' (culture, media, education, social pressure) pressure us to conform, change our identity, and compromise our principles? (Rom 12:2 - "Be not conformed to this world").
*   **The Dilemma:** Serve God faithfully or conform to the world's standards? A choice faced by every believer, often in subtle ways.

### Section 2: The Defining Choice [*] (12 min)
*   **The Resolve:** Daniel's firm, internal decision (Dan 1:8a - "purposed in his heart").
    *   The specific issue: Not to defile himself with the king's food or wine (Dan 1:8b).
    *   Why defiling? Likely involved food offered to idols and/or unclean meats forbidden by God's law (Leviticus 11; cf. Acts 15:29). Principle over preference.
    *   `[Aside: The dietary laws weren't just about health then; they were markers of identity and obedience to God, distinguishing Israel from pagan nations. Compromise here opened the door to broader assimilation.]`
    *   Not rebellion, but principled stand: He *requested* permission, showing tact (Dan 1:8c).
*   **The Request & God's Intervention:** Daniel respectfully approached the official (Dan 1:8c).
    *   God acts: "Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs" (Dan 1:9). Divine providence opens doors for the faithful.
    *   Initial Fear: The official feared the king's reaction (Dan 1:10). Worldly consequences often seem daunting.
*   **The Test Proposed:** Daniel's faith-filled initiative (Dan 1:11-13).
    *   Approached the steward (Melzar) with a practical plan (Dan 1:11).
    *   The proposal: A 10-day trial with simple pulse (vegetables/grains) and water (Dan 1:12).
    *   Reliance on God: Implicit trust that God would vindicate their choice through visible results (Dan 1:13 - "look upon our countenances... and as thou seest, deal with thy servants").
    *   *[Illustration: Like a scientist proposing a controlled experiment, Daniel proposed a test. But the variable wasn't just diet; it was *obedience* and *trust* in God's power to sustain, making it a spiritual test.]*

### Section 3: Faithfulness Honored (11 min)
*   **The Outcome of the Test:** The steward consented (Dan 1:14).
    *   Visible Results: After 10 days, they appeared healthier ("fairer and fatter in flesh") than those eating the king's food (Dan 1:15). [Write on board: Simple Diet + Obedience -> Better Health (Dan 1:15)].
    *   Diet Changed: The steward removed the king's provision and gave them pulse (Dan 1:16). Faithfulness led to practical accommodation.
*   **God's Greater Blessing:** Beyond physical health (Dan 1:17).
    *   Knowledge & Skill: God gave the four youths wisdom in literature and learning (Dan 1:17a). They excelled even in secular studies without compromising faith.
    *   Spiritual Understanding: Daniel specifically received understanding in visions and dreams (Dan 1:17b). God equipped him for his prophetic ministry *because* he was faithful in the "little things."
*   **Standing Before the King:** The ultimate test of their training (Dan 1:18-20).
    *   Examination: Brought before Nebuchadnezzar after the training period (Dan 1:18-19a).
    *   Found Superior: "In all matters of wisdom and understanding... he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm" (Dan 1:19b-20). God publicly honored their private faithfulness.
*   **Endurance:** "And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus" (Dan 1:21). This initial stand set the pattern for a lifetime of faithfulness through multiple regimes.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
*   **Recap:** Daniel and his friends, though captives in a hostile land, chose faithfulness (Dan 1:8). God honored their resolve with favor (Dan 1:9), health (Dan 1:15), wisdom (Dan 1:17), and influence (Dan 1:20).
*   **Relevance Today (Need/Question):** We live in a spiritual 'Babylon'. How can we remain faithful when pressured daily to compromise our identity and obedience to God? (Rom 12:2).
*   **Biblical Principle:** Faithfulness begins with a purpose of heart (Dan 1:8) and trust in God's power (Dan 1:9, 17). God honors commitment to His principles, even in seemingly small areas (cf. Luke 16:10).
*   **Bridging:** Our 'king's meat' might be ungodly entertainment, compromising associations, academic pressures against faith, dishonesty in business, unhealthy habits. Where is God asking us to draw a line?
*   `[Aside: Notice Daniel didn't isolate himself. He engaged with the culture (learning, serving) but drew clear lines based on God's commands. Faithfulness isn't withdrawal, but principled engagement.]`
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Daniel 1):**
    1.  **Purpose:** Identify one specific area of compromise you face. Consciously decide *today*, like Daniel (Dan 1:8), "I purpose in my heart not to defile myself..." [Write on board: My Purpose: Honor God in ______].
    2.  **Pray & Plan:** Ask God for wisdom, favor (Dan 1:9), and tact to navigate the situation. Think practically, like Daniel's 10-day test proposal (Dan 1:11-13).
    3.  **Trust & Act:** Step out in faith, trusting God with the outcome (Dan 1:15, 17, 20). Obedience is our part; the results are His.
*   **Invitation:** Will you, like Daniel, purpose in your heart *this week* to be faithful to God, even when it's difficult or unpopular? Trust that the God who sustained Daniel will sustain you and honor your commitment (cf. 1 Sam 2:30b - "them that honour me I will honour"). Let's ask Him for the courage to stand.
