### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- The Question: What is the _primary_ reason the church exists? **(RQ)** Is it
  fellowship? Worship? Service? Or something more specific?
- Introduce Central Verse: Matthew 28:19-20a - Christ's final instructions.
- State Goal: To understand our core mission as given by Christ Himself.
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & Matt 28:19-20a]

### Section 1: Christ's Authority & Command (10 min)

- **The Foundation: Christ's Authority (Matt 28:18)**
  - Read Matt 28:18. Why does Jesus start with His authority? **(RQ)**
  - [Whiteboard: Write "ALL AUTHORITY" -> Jesus]
  - Significance: Our mission isn't based on our power, but His. He delegates
    His authority for this task.
  - Connection: This authority guarantees the mission's possibility and eventual
    success (Matt 28:20b).
- **The Imperative: "Go... Make Disciples" (Matt 28:19a)**
  - Focus on the main verb: _matheteusate_ (make disciples).
  - The actions (going, baptizing, teaching) describe _how_ we make disciples.
  - [Whiteboard: Circle "Make Disciples" in Matt 28:19]
  - Contrast: Not just 'make converts' or 'get decisions', but develop committed
    followers.
  - **The Scope: "All Nations"**
    - Universal reach – no exceptions.
    - Requires active effort: 'Go' implies initiative, crossing barriers.
    - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our church buildings represent our
      collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual
      embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the
      customs of the surrounding culture, ready to engage 'all nations'.]

### Section 2: The Core Task - Making Disciples (12 min) [*]

- **What is a Disciple?**
  - Not just a student, but a follower, an apprentice.
  - Read Luke 14:27 - Following involves cost, commitment.
  - [Whiteboard: Disciple = Follower of CHRIST (not human leaders)]
  - Key: Allegiance is to Christ directly. Teachers/leaders point _to_ Christ.
  - **(RQ)** How does modern 'church membership' sometimes differ from biblical
    'discipleship' as described in Luke 14?
- **The Actions of Disciple-Making (Matt 28:19b-20a)**
  - **1. Going:** Active participation. Mission requires movement, initiative.
    (Acts 1:8 - Witnessing starts local, expands outward).
    - [Whiteboard: GO]
  - **2. Baptizing:** Public identification with Christ, entry into the visible
    community of faith. (Acts 2:38, 41 - Baptism followed repentance and
    belief).
    - [Whiteboard: BAPTIZE (Public Commitment)]
  - **3. Teaching:** Instruction in _obedience_. Not just knowledge, but
    application.
    - Read Matt 28:20a - "Teaching them to _observe_ all things..."
    - [Whiteboard: TEACH (Obedience to ALL Christ Commanded)]
    - This is ongoing, relational work – maturing believers (Eph 4:11-13).
    - [Concept (based on Eph 4): Church leaders as coaches, equipping players
      (members) for the game (ministry/discipleship), not just spectators.]

### Section 3: The Process & Power (12 min)

- **It's Heart Work**
  - Making disciples isn't just behavioral modification; it's transformation.
  - Requires a change of heart, allegiance, and worldview.
  - This is supernatural work, not achievable by human effort alone.
  - **(RQ)** Why is it tempting to focus on outward conformity rather than
    inward transformation (Matt 23:25-28)?
- **The Essential Role of the Holy Spirit**
  - Read Acts 1:8 - Power to be witnesses comes from the Spirit.
  - Read John 16:8-11 - Spirit convicts of sin, righteousness, judgment.
  - [Whiteboard: Write "HOLY SPIRIT" -> Power for Witness (Acts 1:8), Conviction
    (John 16:8)]
  - Quote: "Christ has given the Spirit as a divine power... Without the Spirit
    of God a knowledge of His word is of no avail... But when the word is
    applied by the Spirit, it works in the heart... Without the Spirit... no
    heart will be touched, no sinner be won to Christ." (COL 328 -
    paraphrase/summarize key idea).
  - Our role: Faithful proclamation and teaching (planting/watering). God's
    role: Giving the increase via the Spirit (1 Cor 3:6-7).
- **The Centrality of the Church**
  - God's chosen instrument for mission (Eph 3:10).
  - Provides community, accountability, and equipping for disciples (Eph
    4:11-16).
  - Early Church Model (Acts): Preaching -> Conversions -> Baptism -> Church
    Planting -> Discipling/Maturing (Acts 2:41-47, Acts 14:21-23).
  - [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves... We can use our resources and
    time collectively to demonstrate Christ's mission. It's like finding a
    coin—even from a worldly system, we can pool it for God's kingdom work,
    opening doors for discipleship.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Our mission, given by Christ (Matt 28:18-20), is clear: Make
  disciples.
  - This involves Going, Baptizing, and Teaching obedience.
  - It's heart work, empowered ONLY by the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8, John 15:5).
  - [Whiteboard: Review key terms: Authority -> Make Disciples (Go, Baptize,
    Teach) -> Holy Spirit Power]
- **Christ's Guarantee:**
  - Read Matt 28:20b - "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the
    world."
  - His authority backs it, His presence enables it.
  - **(RQ)** How does Christ's promise change our perspective on the challenges
    of mission?
- **Call to Action:** Making disciples starts with being one and sharing what we
  know. Let's move from understanding to action this week:
  1.  **Pray for One:** Identify one person this week (neighbor, colleague,
      friend) you will intentionally pray for daily, asking the Holy Spirit
      (Acts 1:8) to open doors for witness. `[Action Step]`
  2.  **Share One Truth:** Find a natural opportunity this week to share one
      specific truth about Jesus or His commands (Matt 28:20) with someone.
      `[Action Step]`
  3.  **Focus on Obedience:** Choose one command of Jesus discussed today (or
      one you're studying) and consciously seek the Spirit's help to _observe_
      it more faithfully this week (Matt 28:20). `[Action Step]`
- **Invitation:** Let's commit not just to _knowing_ the Great Commission, but
  actively _participating_ in it, relying on His authority and Spirit.
- Final Prayer (Include praying for commitment to these steps).
