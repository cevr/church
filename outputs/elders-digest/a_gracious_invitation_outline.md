### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Invitations - some exclusive, some common. God's invitation in Christ is the most vital and universally offered.
-   **The Astonishing Offer:** Introduce Isaiah 1:18 – God's desire to reason and cleanse.
    -   [Whiteboard: Title - "A Gracious Invitation"]
-   **Purpose:** Explore the depth, conditions, promise, and urgency of God's call to sinners.
-   **Simplicity Focus:** God makes the way clear and accessible – "Come now..."

### Main Content Section 1: The Problem & God's Initiative (10 min)

-   **The Reality of Sin:**
    -   What is it? Transgression of God's law (1 John 3:4).
    -   Who is affected? All have sinned (Romans 3:23).
    -   What are its consequences? Separation from God, death (Isaiah 59:2; Romans 6:23).
        -   [Whiteboard: Sin = Lawlessness (1 Jn 3:4) -> Separation (Isa 59:2) -> Death (Rom 6:23)]
    -   (RQ) Do we minimize sin, forgetting its deadly nature and separation from Life itself?
-   **God's Loving Initiative:**
    -   He doesn't wait for us to be worthy; He acts first (Romans 5:8).
        -   [Whiteboard: God's Initiative -> While sinners (Rom 5:8)]
    -   His love precedes our response (1 John 4:19).
    -   The invitation itself is pure grace – unmerited favor.
    -   (RQ) How does understanding God's initiative change how we view His invitation?

### Main Content Section 2: The Invitation & Its Conditions (12 min) [*]

-   **"Come Now, Let Us Reason Together" (Isaiah 1:18a):**
    -   God desires relationship, not just compliance.
    -   He appeals to our understanding, inviting dialogue.
        -   [Whiteboard: Isa 1:18a -> "Come... let us REASON"]
    -   (RQ) What does it mean that the infinite God invites *us* to reason with Him about our condition and His solution?
-   **The Necessary Response: Repentance:**
    -   Not earning forgiveness, but a condition for receiving it.
    -   What is repentance? A turning *from* sin *to* God (Acts 3:19).
        -   [Whiteboard: Repentance = Turning TO God (Acts 3:19)]
    -   God's plea: "Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?" (Ezekiel 33:11).
    -   It involves a change of mind, heart, and direction, enabled by His Spirit.
    -   [Aside: Repentance isn't just feeling sorry; it's a change of mind and direction, empowered by God's Spirit drawing us, like turning a ship towards a safe harbor.]
    -   (RQ) Is our turning genuine, affecting our choices and direction daily?

### Main Content Section 3: The Promise & The Urgency (12 min)

-   **The Promise: Complete Cleansing (Isaiah 1:18b):**
    -   Radical transformation: Scarlet to Snow, Crimson to Wool.
        -   [Whiteboard: Isa 1:18b -> Scarlet = Snow; Crimson = Wool => TOTAL Cleansing]
    -   This isn't masking sin, but removing its stain and power.
    -   How? Through Christ: "The blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" (1 John 1:7).
    -   Requires confession & faith: "If we confess... He is faithful and just to forgive... and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).
        -   [Whiteboard: Cleansing Agent: Blood of Jesus (1 John 1:7, 9)]
    -   [Analogy (from Isa 1:18): Like a hopelessly stained garment made perfectly new by a divine process, not just bleached but fundamentally changed.]
-   **The Goal: Restoration and Holiness:**
    -   Cleansing leads to restoration of God's image (cf. Colossians 3:10).
    -   Preparation for eternity: "Follow... holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord" (Hebrews 12:14).
    -   Connects to God's purpose for His last-day people: Reflecting Christ fully.
-   **The Urgency: "Come *Now*" (Isaiah 1:18):**
    -   Today is the acceptable time (2 Corinthians 6:2).
        -   [Whiteboard: URGENCY = NOW! (Isa 1:18; 2 Cor 6:2)]
    -   Life is uncertain; delay is dangerous (James 4:14).
    -   (RQ) Why the emphasis on 'now'? What spiritual dangers lie in procrastination?
    -   Last-Day Relevance: This urgency aligns with the final gospel call before Christ's return (Revelation 14:6-7 – "the hour of His judgment is come"). Responding *now* is essential preparation.
    -   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Responding to God's 'now' makes us living representatives of that kingdom.]
