### Introduction (5 min)

- **Opening Question:** What does it _really_ mean to live by faith in a world
  obsessed with sight and proof? **(RQ)**
- Introduce the concept: Faith isn't blind wishing, but confident trust based on
  God's character and Word (Heb 11:1). It's the spiritual sense that apprehends
  the unseen.
- Central Verse Focus: Hebrews 11:6 - Faith is the non-negotiable requirement
  for pleasing God.
  - [Write on board: Faith = 1. Believing HE IS (Existence/Character) + 2.
    Believing HE REWARDS (Promise/Justice)]
  - Emphasize both aspects are crucial (Heb 11:6b).
- Study Purpose: To explore, through Scripture, the _adequacy_ of faith – how it
  empowers us to live victoriously and purposefully, pleasing God even when we
  can't see the immediate outcome.

### Section 1: Faith's Foundation & Nature (10 min)

- **Faith Defined: Substance and Evidence (Heb 11:1)**

  - "Substance" (Gr. _hypostasis_): Assurance, confidence, the title deed to
    things hoped for. It makes future realities present to the believer (Heb
    11:1a).
  - "Evidence" (Gr. _elenchos_): Proof, conviction concerning things not seen.
    Faith provides certainty about the invisible realm (Heb 11:1b).
  - [Write on board: Heb 11:1 - Faith = Substance (Hope) + Evidence (Unseen)]
  - `[Aside: The Greek word for "evidence" here, *elenchos*, carries a legal sense, like presenting convincing proof in a courtroom. Faith isn't flimsy; it's a conviction based on God's testimony.]`

- **Faith is Positive & Rooted in God's Promises & Power (Rom 4:20-21)**
  - Contrast: Not denying difficult reality, but affirming God's power _over_
    reality (Rom 4:19).
  - Abraham's Example: He "staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief;
    but was strong in faith, giving glory to God" (Rom 4:20).
  - Basis of his strength: Being "fully persuaded that, what he [God] had
    promised, he was able also to perform" (Rom 4:21).
  - **Illustration:** Imagine receiving a certified check from a billionaire.
    You haven't cashed it yet (seen the money), but you treat it as real wealth
    because you trust the source and the promise on the check. Faith treats
    God's promises similarly based on His trustworthy character.

### Section 2: Faith's Character & Cost [*] (12 min)

- **Faith Obeys God's Warnings (Heb 11:7)**

  - Noah's Example: "By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as
    yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house" (Heb
    11:7a).
  - Action based on unseen future: He acted solely on God's word about a flood
    never before experienced.
  - Result: Condemned the world's unbelief and became "heir of the righteousness
    which is by faith" (Heb 11:7b).
  - What does Noah's obedience despite the lack of physical evidence teach us
    about trusting God's warnings today? **(RQ)**

- **Faith Makes Costly Choices (Heb 11:24-26)**
  - Moses' Example: "By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be
    called the son of Pharaoh's daughter" (Heb 11:24). This was a rejection of
    immense power, wealth, and status.
  - Choosing Affliction over Pleasure: "Choosing rather to suffer affliction
    with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season"
    (Heb 11:25).
  - [Write on board: Moses' Choice: Affliction (God's People) > Pleasures
    (Sin/Egypt)]
  - Valuing Christ over Worldly Treasure: "Esteeming the reproach of Christ
    greater riches than the treasures in Egypt" (Heb 11:26a).
  - `[Aside: The "reproach of Christ" here likely refers to the shame and suffering associated with identifying with God's chosen people and purpose, a foreshadowing of Christ's own suffering. Moses saw value where the world saw shame.]`
  - Motivation: "for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward" (Heb
    11:26b). He looked beyond the immediate to the eternal reward promised by
    God (linking back to Heb 11:6).

### Section 3: Faith in Action & Perseverance (12 min)

- **Faith is Demonstrated by Works (James 2:18, 26)**

  - Challenge: "Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
    thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works"
    (James 2:18).
  - Principle: Genuine faith is never passive; it inevitably produces
    action/obedience.
  - [Write on board: Faith (Internal Belief) -> Works (External Evidence)]
  - Conclusion: "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
    works is dead also" (James 2:26). Works don't save, but they are the vital
    sign of living faith.
  - How do our daily actions either confirm or contradict the faith we profess?
    **(RQ)**

- **Faith Lives with an Eternal Perspective (Heb 11:13)**
  - The Patriarchs' Example: "These all died in faith, not having received the
    promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and
    embraced them..." (Heb 11:13a). They trusted God even without seeing the
    full earthly fulfillment.
  - Identity: "...and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the
    earth" (Heb 11:13b). Their true citizenship and focus were heavenly.
  - **Illustration:** Like travelers in a foreign land who don't get overly
    attached to temporary accommodations because they know their real home
    awaits. Faith gives us this pilgrim mindset, focusing on God's eternal
    kingdom rather than temporary earthly comforts or successes.
  - This perspective fuels perseverance through trials (Heb 11:35-38 - _can
    mention briefly if time_).

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** True, biblical faith is not wishful thinking. It is:
  - Founded on God's character and promises (Rom 4:21).
  - The substance of hope and evidence of the unseen (Heb 11:1).
  - Characterized by obedience and costly choices (Heb 11:7, 24-26).
  - Demonstrated through action (James 2:18).
  - Persevering with an eternal perspective (Heb 11:13).
- **Revisit Central Verse:** Without _this kind_ of active, trusting faith, "it
  is impossible to please him" (Heb 11:6). God desires our trust in Him _as He
  is_ and in His promises _as He gives them_.
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
  1.  **Identify & Trust:** Identify one specific area where you struggle to
      trust God because you can't "see" the outcome. Consciously choose to rely
      on His character and promises this week (cf. Rom 4:20-21).
  2.  **Act in Obedience:** Is there a clear command or prompting from God's
      Word you've been hesitant to act on? Take one concrete step of obedience
      this week, demonstrating faith through action (cf. Heb 11:7; James 2:18).
  3.  **Shift Perspective:** When facing difficulty or temptation, consciously
      ask: "What choice aligns with God's eternal reward rather than temporary
      pleasure/ease?" (cf. Heb 11:26).
- **Invitation:** Let's ask God to increase our faith – not as a passive
  feeling, but as an active trust that shapes how we live, enabling us to walk
  pleasing Him, even when navigating by the unseen realities of His kingdom.
  Will you choose to live by _this_ faith today?
