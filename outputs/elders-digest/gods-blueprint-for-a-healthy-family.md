### Introduction (5 min)

-   The state of the family today vs. God's ideal.
-   Why is a healthy family structure crucial? (Societal stability, reflecting God's character)
-   God's design isn't outdated; it's foundational.
-   Central Theme: Building families on God's unchanging principles, starting with mutual submission in Christ. (Eph 5:21)
    -   [Write on board: Eph 5:21 - Mutual Submission in Fear of God]
-   Purpose: To explore God's blueprint for family health as revealed in Scripture.

### Section 1: The Divine Foundation (10 min)

-   **God as the Source:** Families must have God as their foundation.
    -   Following His example: Ephesians 5:1-2 - "Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us..."
    -   What does it mean to *follow* God in family life? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: Foundation = Following God (Eph 5:1) + Walking in Love (Eph 5:2)]
-   **Marriage: A Divine Covenant:** Established by God, not man.
    -   Genesis 2:18, 21-24: God's direct action in creating Eve for Adam; the 'leaving and cleaving'.
    -   [Write on board: Gen 2:24 - Leave, Cleave, One Flesh = God's Design]
    -   It's more than a contract; it's a spiritual covenant reflecting Christ and the Church (Eph 5:31-32).
    -   How does viewing marriage as a *covenant* change our approach vs. seeing it as a *contract*? **(RQ)**
-   **Equality and Roles:** Equal value, distinct roles.
    -   Genesis 1:27: Male and female created in God's image - equal worth and dignity.
    -   [Aside: Like two pillars holding up an arch, both are essential and equal in load-bearing, yet distinct in position. So it is with God's design for husband and wife.]

### Section 2: Roles, Submission & Love [*] (12 min)

-   **The Principle of Submission:** Often misunderstood.
    -   Starts with Mutual Submission: Ephesians 5:21 - "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God."
        -   This isn't hierarchy first, but mutual respect and yielding in reverence to God.
        -   [Write on board: Mutual Submission (Eph 5:21) -> Specific Roles]
-   **Wife's Role:** Submission to husband *as unto the Lord*.
    -   Ephesians 5:22-24: Submission in the context of the husband's headship, mirroring the Church's submission to Christ.
    -   This is *not* inferiority or blind obedience; it's respectful deference within God's order.
    -   1 Peter 3:1-6: Influence through godly character, even with unbelieving spouse. Winning without a word.
    -   [Metaphor (from 1 Pet 3): A wife's godly character as a quiet, powerful sermon.]
    -   What does submission 'in the Lord' mean practically? (Not submitting to sin). **(RQ)**
-   **Husband's Role:** Loving Leadership.
    -   Ephesians 5:25-29: Love wives as Christ loved the Church - self-sacrificing, sanctifying love.
    -   Nourish and cherish - promoting spiritual and overall well-being.
    -   Headship is responsibility, not dictatorship. Firm, yet humble leadership.
    -   [Write on board: Husband's Love (Eph 5:25) = Sacrificial + Sanctifying]
    -   How does Christ's love for the Church provide the model for husbands? **(RQ)**
-   **Building Trust:** Loyalty and faithfulness are non-negotiable (Mal 2:14-16).

### Section 3: Nurturing the Next Generation (12 min)

-   **Children's Role:** Honor and Obedience.
    -   Ephesians 6:1-3: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. Honour thy father and mother... that it may be well with thee..."
    -   Obedience 'in the Lord' - context of God's will.
    -   Honor goes beyond obedience - respect, care, valuing.
    -   [Write on board: Children (Eph 6:1-3) = Obey + Honor]
-   **Parents' Responsibility:** Nurture, Not Provoke.
    -   Ephesians 6:4: "Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
    -   Avoid exasperation, harshness, unreasonable demands.
    -   Focus on godly training and instruction.
    -   [Write Question (from Eph 6:4): How can parents discipline without provoking wrath?]
-   **The Great Commission in the Home:** Teaching God's Word.
    -   Deuteronomy 6:6-9: God's commands central to home life - teach diligently, talk of them constantly.
    -   [Write on board: Deut 6:6-7 = Teach Diligently]
    -   Parents are the primary spiritual guides.
    -   [Aside: Our homes should be the first school and the first church a child experiences, laying a foundation that institutions can build upon, but never replace.]
-   **Practical Modeling & Time:**
    -   Parents must *model* the biblical lifestyle they teach.
    -   Prioritize T-I-M-E: Teaching, Intimacy, Modeling, Encouragement.
    -   Accountability: Parents are accountable to God for their children's upbringing (Proverbs 22:6).
