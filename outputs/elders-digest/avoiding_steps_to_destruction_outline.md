### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** We all face temptation. But does sin just *happen*, or is there a process we can recognize and interrupt?
-   **The Danger:** Unchecked sin leads not just to mistakes, but ultimately to destruction (Rom 6:23).
-   **Central Truth:** James 1:14-15 reveals a clear progression from desire to death. [Write James 1:14-15 on board]
-   **Goal:** To understand the steps that lead *to* sin, so we can recognize them and choose God's path *away* from destruction, finding victory in Christ.

### Section 1: The Anatomy of a Fall (12 min)

-   **Sin's Progression:** Sin rarely starts with the final act. It follows a pattern.
-   **Biblical Examples - The Steps:**
    -   **Eve (Genesis 3:6):**
        -   *Seeing:* She *saw* the tree was good for food, pleasant to the eyes. (v. 6a) [Write on board: 1. SEEING (Gen 3:6)]
        -   *Dwelling/Coveting:* A tree *desired* to make one wise. (v. 6b) [Write: 2. COVETING (Gen 3:6)]
        -   *Taking:* She *took* of the fruit thereof, and did eat. (v. 6c) [Write: 3. TAKING (Gen 3:6)]
        -   *Hiding (Implied later):* Fear and hiding from God (Gen 3:8, 10). [Write: 4. HIDING (Gen 3:10)]
    -   **Achan (Joshua 7:20-21):**
        -   *Seeing:* "When I *saw* among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment..." (v. 21a) [Point to SEEING on board - Add ref: Josh 7:21]
        -   *Coveting:* "...then I *coveted* them..." (v. 21b) [Point to COVETING - Add ref: Josh 7:21]
        -   *Taking:* "...and *took* them..." (v. 21c) [Point to TAKING - Add ref: Josh 7:21]
        -   *Hiding:* "...and, behold, they are *hid* in the earth in the midst of my tent..." (v. 21d) [Point to HIDING - Add ref: Josh 7:21]
-   **The Consistent Pattern:** Seeing/Dwelling -> Coveting -> Taking (Action) -> Hiding/Consequences.
-   **(RQ):** How do we see this same pattern (seeing, wanting, taking, hiding) play out with temptations we face today (e.g., online content, materialism, gossip)?

### Section 2: The Root in the Heart [*] (12 min)

-   **Identifying the Foundation:** What fuels this progression? Covetousness.
    -   The Tenth Commandment: "Thou shalt not covet..." (Exodus 20:17) - A sin of the heart/mind.
    -   Jesus' Warning: "Take heed, and beware of covetousness..." (Luke 12:15)
    -   [Write on board: COVETOUSNESS (Ex 20:17) = Foundational Desire]
-   **Sin's Origin:** The battle begins in the mind.
    -   James 1:14: Temptation starts when we are "drawn away of his *own lust* [desire], and enticed." [Link to COVETOUSNESS on board]
    -   Proverbs 4:23: "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life." [Write: Guard the HEART/MIND (Prov 4:23)]
-   **Vulnerability Factors:**
    -   Lack of Spiritual Insight/Faith: Not discerning the danger or trusting God's way leaves us open (Hosea 4:6a - "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge").
    -   Failure to Glorify God: Sin is inherently selfish, putting self/desire before God's will and glory (Rom 1:21 - refused to glorify Him).
-   **(RQ):** If sin begins with desire in the mind (James 1:14), how crucial is managing our thought life?
-   **[Aside: Like spiritual embassies...]** *"Our minds are like the control room of our lives. What we allow on the screens of our imagination determines the direction we steer. Guarding our thoughts isn't just defensive; it's setting the course towards God's kingdom, making our inner world a territory that represents heaven's principles, not the world's."

### Section 3: God's Pathway to Victory (11 min)

-   **The Promise of Escape:** We are not left helpless in temptation.
    -   1 Corinthians 10:13: God provides a "way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." [Write: God's Way of Escape (1 Cor 10:13)]
    -   **(RQ):** Do we actively look for God's provided 'escape route' when tempted, or do we focus on the temptation itself?
-   **Proactive Defense - Guarding the Gates:**
    -   Eyes: "I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes..." (Psalm 101:3a). What we look at influences what we desire. [Write: Guard Eyes/Senses (Ps 101:3)]
    -   Thoughts: Bringing "into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ" (2 Cor 10:5).
-   **The Ultimate Focus:** Where should our gaze be?
    -   Hebrews 12:2: "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith..." [Write: Look to JESUS (Heb 12:2)]
    -   **(RQ):** How does fixing our eyes on Christ diminish the appeal of worldly temptations?
    -   [Analogy (from Heb 12:2): Like running a race - looking at the crowd/obstacles causes stumbling; looking at the finish line (Jesus) keeps us focused and moving forward.]
-   **Setting the Mind:** A conscious choice.
    -   Colossians 3:2: "Set your affection [mind] on things above, not on things on the earth." [Write: Set Mind Above (Col 3:2)]
    -   This brings peace (Isaiah 26:3) and assurance.
-   **God's Provision:** He gives life and power for daily victory to those who seek and obey Him (John 10:10b; Phil 4:13).
-   **[Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...]** *"Just as sunlight disinfects, bringing God's Word and the light of Christ's presence into our thought life cleanses the desires. We can't stop temptations from appearing (like birds flying overhead), but by God's grace, we can prevent them from building nests in our minds (Col 3:2)."

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

-   **Recap:** We've seen the clear steps *down* into sin (See -> Covet -> Take -> Hide) originating from the heart (James 1:14-15; Joshua 7:21).
-   **The Stark Reality:** Unrepented sin leads to death/destruction (James 1:15; Rom 6:23).
-   **The Glorious Alternative:** God offers a way of escape (1 Cor 10:13) and victory through:
    -   Guarding our senses and thoughts (Ps 101:3; Prov 4:23).
    -   Looking steadfastly unto Jesus (Heb 12:2).
    -   Setting our minds on heavenly realities (Col 3:2).
-   **Invitation:** The choice is ours daily. Will we recognize the subtle steps towards destruction and turn to God's path? Will we guard our hearts and fix our eyes on Jesus, allowing Him to give us victory?
-   **Final Thought:** Choose life, choose obedience, choose Christ.
