### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a relatable concept of cleaning a room but leaving it
  empty – dust settles, clutter returns. It needs purpose, furniture.
- **The Spiritual Parallel:** Introduce the concept that spiritual cleansing
  from sin isn't the end goal; it's preparation.
- **Central Text Intro:** Briefly introduce Matthew 12:43-45 as Jesus' warning
  about this very danger.
- **Thesis:** Today, we'll explore _why_ simply being 'empty' of sin isn't
  enough and _what_ God intends to fill our hearts with for lasting
  transformation and security, based on Scripture.
- `[Whiteboard: Title - The Danger of the Empty House]`
- `[Whiteboard: Central Verse - Matt 12:45]`

### Section 1: The Parable of the Empty House (10 min)

- **Reading & Context:** Read Matthew 12:43-45. Briefly explain the context
  (Jesus casting out demons, accusations).
- **Unpacking the Parable:** Step-by-step breakdown:
  - The unclean spirit leaves (Initial cleansing/reformation) - Matt 12:43
  - Finds the house 'empty, swept, and garnished' (Outwardly clean, but
    unoccupied by the rightful owner) - Matt 12:44
  - `[Whiteboard: Draw simple house: 1. Dirty -> 2. Clean BUT Empty]`
  - **(RQ):** What does 'empty' signify here? (Absence of positive, divine
    presence).
  - The spirit returns with reinforcements (Relapse) - Matt 12:45a
  - The final state is worse (Increased bondage) - Matt 12:45b
  - `[Whiteboard: Draw simple house: 3. Re-occupied & Worse (7+ spirits)]`
- **Supporting Warning:** Read 2 Peter 2:20-22 (Returning to defilement after
  escaping).
  - Connects the principle: Knowing truth/experiencing cleansing isn't enough if
    there's a return to sin.
- **Key Takeaway:** Moral reformation or initial repentance without active
  occupation by Christ leaves one vulnerable to a worse spiritual state.

### Section 2: What Fills the Cleansed Heart? [*] (12 min)

- **The Divine Occupant:** Transition: If emptiness is dangerous, what's the
  solution? God intends to dwell within.
  - **Ephesians 3:17:** Read. Christ dwelling _in your hearts through faith_.
  - `[Whiteboard: FILLING THE HOUSE: 1. Christ (Eph 3:17)]`
  - **(RQ):** How does faith act as the 'key' for Christ to dwell within?
    (Trust, surrender, acceptance).
- **The Atmosphere of the Heart:** What does Christ's presence bring?
  - **Colossians 3:15:** Read. Let the _peace of God rule_ in your hearts.
  - `[Whiteboard: FILLING THE HOUSE: 2. God's Peace (Col 3:15)]`
  - **(RQ):** What does it mean for peace to 'rule' or 'act as umpire'? (Governs
    decisions, calms turmoil).
  - **Colossians 3:16a:** Read. Let the _word of Christ dwell in you richly_.
  - `[Whiteboard: FILLING THE HOUSE: 3. God's Word (Col 3:16)]`
  - `[Illustration Concept (from Col 3:16): Word dwelling richly like a well-stocked pantry, providing spiritual nourishment for every need and temptation.]`
- **The Law Within:** God's standard written internally.
  - **Hebrews 8:10:** Read. "I will put my laws in their mind and write them on
    their hearts."
  - `[Whiteboard: FILLING THE HOUSE: 4. God's Law (Heb 8:10)]`
  - Connect: This isn't legalism, but the internal principle of love and
    obedience empowered by the Spirit.
- `[Aside: "It's not just about *not* doing wrong; it's about actively replacing those empty spaces. Nature abhors a vacuum, and so does the spiritual life. If Christ doesn't fill it, something else surely will."]`

### Section 3: Actively Guarding and Filling (12 min)

- **Sanctification as Active Replacement:** Emphasize that filling the heart is
  part of sanctification – an ongoing, active process.
- **Renewing the Mind:** The battleground.
  - **Romans 12:1-2:** Read. Be transformed by the _renewing of your mind_.
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Renew Mind (Rom 12:2)]`
  - **(RQ):** How does focusing on Christ, His Word, His peace (from Section 2)
    actively _renew_ the mind according to this verse?
- **Practical Steps for Filling (Derived from Scripture):**
  - **Colossians 3:16b:** Teaching, admonishing, singing with grace.
    - `[Whiteboard: Action: Spiritual Songs/Fellowship (Col 3:16)]`
  - **Ephesians 5:18-19:** Be _filled with the Spirit_, speaking in psalms,
    hymns, spiritual songs.
    - `[Whiteboard: Action: Be Spirit-Filled (Eph 5:18)]`
  - **Philippians 4:8:** Read. Think on things that are true, noble, just, pure,
    lovely, good report.
    - `[Whiteboard: Action: Choose Godly Thoughts/Media (Phil 4:8)]`
    - **(RQ):** How does consciously choosing our focus based on Phil 4:8 guard
      the 'house'?
  - **1 Corinthians 15:33:** Read. "Evil company corrupts good habits."
    - `[Whiteboard: Action: Choose Godly Friends (1 Cor 15:33)]`
    - `[Aside: "Choosing godly friends (1 Cor 15:33) isn't about exclusivity, but about protecting the atmosphere of the heart. Just as you wouldn't invite termites into your clean house, we must be wise about the influences we allow constant access to our minds."]`
- **The Danger of Neglect & Hardening [*]:**
  - **Hebrews 3:12-13:** Read. Warning against an evil heart of unbelief,
    exhorting one another _daily_ lest any be hardened.
  - Connect: Hardening comes from _neglecting_ to fill the heart, allowing
    unbelief/sin to re-enter and take root.
  - Briefly mention Hebrews 6:4-6 & 10:26-29 as the ultimate consequence of
    persistent, willful rejection after enlightenment (the 'worse state'). This
    is not easily reached but a solemn warning against trifling with grace.
  - **(RQ):** Seeing the warning in Hebrews 3, how vital is the _daily_ choice
    to fill our hearts?

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** We've seen the danger Jesus warned about – the empty house (Matt
  12:45). Cleansing is crucial but incomplete.
- **The Solution:** The heart must be actively filled with Christ through faith
  (Eph 3:17), His peace (Col 3:15), His Word (Col 3:16), and His Spirit (Eph
  5:18), leading to a renewed mind (Rom 12:2) and a life reflecting His law
  written within (Heb 8:10).
- **Call to Action:** Don't leave your heart 'swept and empty.' Choose today and
  every day to actively invite Christ in. Fill your mind with His Word, seek His
  Spirit, cultivate godly thoughts and relationships.
- **Final Encouragement:** This isn't about fearful perfectionism, but joyful
  cooperation with God who desires to dwell richly within us. He provides the
  grace and power.
- **Gentle Invitation:** Will you commit to actively filling your heart with
  God's presence this week through prayer, study, and conscious choices?
- **Prayer:** Closing prayer asking for the Holy Spirit to fill each heart, for
  strength to make godly choices, and for Christ to dwell richly within.
