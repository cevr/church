### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** The universal reality of temptation. **(RQ)** Who hasn't felt the pull of temptation, sometimes feeling overwhelmed?
-   **Core Truth:** Introduce God's unwavering faithfulness as our anchor (1 Cor 10:13).
-   **Study Goal:** To explore *from Scripture* God's promise and provision for victory over temptation, focusing on His faithfulness and the power He supplies.
-   **Central Verse Focus:** Read 1 Cor 10:13. `[Write on board: 1 Cor 10:13 - God is Faithful]`

### Section 1: The Unfailing Promise in Temptation (10 min)

-   **Focus:** Unpacking the layers of promise in 1 Corinthians 10:13.
-   **Commonality:** "No temptation... but such as is common to man." We are not alone; others face similar struggles (Heb 4:15). **(RQ)** How does knowing this help?
-   **God's Faithfulness:** "God is faithful." `[Whiteboard: FAITHFUL (1 Cor 10:13)]` His nature guarantees His promise. He won't abandon us.
-   **Divine Limitation:** "Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able." `[Whiteboard: LIMITATION (1 Cor 10:13)]` God knows our capacity (Ps 103:14) and sets boundaries on the trial's intensity. **(RQ)** Does this mean temptation won't feel hard? (No, but it won't be *impossible* to bear with His help).
-   **Divine Provision:** "Will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it." `[Whiteboard: WAY OF ESCAPE (1 Cor 10:13)]`
    -   **Clarification:** The 'escape' isn't always removal *from* the trial, but often strength *through* it. `[Brief Analogy: A life raft (removes from water) vs. Scuba gear (equips to survive in water) - God provides what's needed]`. It's power *to bear it*.
    -   Connect to James 1:12 - "Blessed is the man that *endureth* temptation..."

### Section 2: The Divine Provision: Word and Way [*] (12 min)

-   **Focus:** Identifying God's primary tools for our victory: His Word and His Son.
-   **Christ's Example:** Luke 4:1-13. `[Whiteboard: Luke 4 - "It is written"]`
    -   How did Jesus face the tempter? (Direct, authoritative use of Scripture).
    -   **RQ:** What does Christ's reliance on Scripture teach us about *our* defense strategy?
    -   He met temptation as a man, relying on His Father's Word, showing us the path.
-   **The Word as Our Weapon:**
    -   Ephesians 6:17 - "The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God." `[Whiteboard: Word = Sword (Eph 6:17)]`
    -   EGW Insight: "The shield of faith... the helmet of salvation... the sword of the Spirit... These heavenly weapons alone will insure the victory." (Ministry of Healing, p. 181). The Word is offensive/defensive.
    -   **RQ:** How effectively are we wielding this sword daily?
-   **Reliance on the Living Word:**
    -   Jesus IS the Word (John 1:1, 14). Victory comes through relationship with Him. `[Whiteboard: Jesus = Living Word (John 1:1)]`
    -   It's His life and power *in us* that overcomes (Gal 2:20).
    -   `[Aside: Our connection to Christ is like a branch to the vine (John 15). Cut off, we wither and are powerless against temptation's blast; connected, His life-giving sap flows into us, providing strength and fruitfulness even under pressure.]`
-   **Active Resistance:** 1 Peter 5:8-9. `[Whiteboard: Resist steadfast in faith (1 Pet 5:9)]` Faith activates the power of the Word and our connection to Christ.

### Section 3: Strength, Endurance, and Character Transformation (12 min)

-   **Focus:** How God uses temptation (when resisted through His power) to strengthen us and refine our character.
-   **Strength in Weakness:** 2 Corinthians 12:9-10. `[Whiteboard: 2 Cor 12:9 - Grace Sufficient | Strength in Weakness]`
    -   Paul's 'thorn': God's power made perfect in weakness. **(RQ)** How does acknowledging our weakness open the door for God's strength?
    -   God's grace is not just pardon, but enabling power.
-   **Victory is Possible for All:**
    -   EGW Assurance: "Temptation is not sin... Though tempted, if he does not yield, he commits no sin... It is possible for every one to overcome." (God's Amazing Grace, p. 111). `[Whiteboard: Victory Possible for ALL (EGW)]`
    -   This promise applies to *us*, today.
-   **Character Building Through Trials:**
    -   James 1:2-4: Trials -> Patience -> Perfection (maturity/completeness). `[Whiteboard: Trials (resisted) -> Patience -> Character (James 1:2-4)]`
    -   **RQ:** How does enduring temptation faithfully contribute to becoming more like Christ?
    -   EGW on Character: Aim for a "strong, symmetrical character" (God's Amazing Grace, p. 81); possibility of a "spotless character" through Christ's help and promises (Faith I Live By, p. 23). `[Write Question: What does a 'spotless character' practically mean in daily life?]`
    -   This aligns with God's goal: Restoring His image in us, preparing a people who reflect Him fully (Implicit Last Generation theme).
    -   `[Aside: Think of a blacksmith shaping metal. The fire (temptation) and the hammer (God's Word/providence) work together, not to destroy, but to shape the metal into a useful, strong, and refined instrument. God uses trials, met with His strength, to shape us.]`
