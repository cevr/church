### Section 1: The Gravity and Scope of Adultery (10 min)

- **Defining Adultery:** More than just the physical act.
  - Includes emotional infidelity, lustful thoughts, spiritual unfaithfulness
    (idolatry).

    `[Whiteboard: Sin vs. God (Ps 51:4)]`
- **The Starting Point:** The Heart & Mind.
  - Revisit Matthew 5:27-28. **(RQ)** How does understanding adultery starts
    _before_ the act change how we approach temptation?
- **The Consequence:** Self-destruction.
  - Proverbs 6:32 - It lacks understanding and destroys the soul. **(RQ)** Why
    is adultery described as lacking understanding?

### Section 2: Why It Happens & God's Ideal [*] (12 min)

- **Root Causes:** Exploring the 'why'.
  - Pride/Arrogance (Prov 16:18) - Feeling above the rules or entitled.
  - Devaluing Commitment - Treating vows lightly.
  - Prioritizing Personal Pleasure over God's Law & partner's well-being (cf.
    Phil 2:3-4).
  - `[Whiteboard: Causes: Pride, Low View of Vows, Selfishness]`
- **God's Design:** Exclusivity & Reflection.
  - Marriage reflects the exclusive, covenant relationship God desires with His
    people (Jer 3:14; Eph 5:25-32).

  - **(RQ)** If marriage reflects Christ and the Church, what does faithfulness
    in marriage teach us about God?
- **Modern Battlegrounds:** Increased Temptation.
  - Internet, media, cultural norms normalizing infidelity.
  - Need for heightened vigilance and guarding the avenues of the soul.
  - `[Aside: Our homes and minds should be like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory representing the kingdom of heaven's purity, not adopting the customs of the surrounding digital or cultural landscape.]`

### Section 3: God's Power for Purity & Practical Steps (12 min)

- **The Internal Conflict:** Flesh vs. Spirit.
  - Adultery listed as a work of the flesh (Galatians 5:19).
  - Contrast with walking by the Spirit (Galatians 5:16).
  - The Fruit includes self-control (temperance) (Galatians 5:22-23).
    `[Whiteboard: Flesh (Gal 5:19) vs. Spirit (Gal 5:16, 22-23) -> Self-Control]`
- **The Divine Solution:** Fleeing Sin & Abiding in Christ.
  - 1 Corinthians 6:18 - Command to "Flee fornication." **(RQ)** What does
    active 'fleeing' look like practically today?
  - 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 - Body is the temple of the Holy Spirit; we are bought
    with a price.
    `[Whiteboard: 1 Cor 6:18-20: Flee! + Temple + Bought w/ Price -> Glorify God]`
  - Victory comes through reliance on God's power, not willpower alone.
- **Practical Application Framework:** Building Hedges.
  - **Need:** Constant exposure to temptation.
  - **Principle:** God provides power through His Spirit and Word.
  - **Practice:**
    - Guard the Mind: What you watch, read, think (Prov 4:23; Phil 4:8).
      `[Whiteboard: Action: Guard Thoughts (Prov 4:23)]`
    - Prayer & Study: Daily connection with Jesus (Ps 119:9, 11). Builds
      spiritual strength.
    - Cultivate Marital Intimacy: Strengthen the marriage bond (Prov 5:15-19; 1
      Cor 7:3-5).
    - Teach the Next Generation: Instill godly principles early (Deut 6:6-7).
    - Yield to the Holy Spirit: Conscious daily choice (Gal 5:16).
      `[Whiteboard: Action: Yield Daily (Gal 5:16)]`
- **Character Connection:** Faithfulness, purity, self-control are vital
  elements of Christlike character, developed through dependence on the Spirit.
  This purity is essential for those preparing for Christ's return (cf. 1 John
  3:2-3; Rev 14:4-5 - purity of the 144,000).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** God's standard is high (heart purity), the consequences of sin
  are severe, but His power is sufficient.
- **Hope & Forgiveness:** God offers forgiveness and restoration to the truly
  repentant (1 John 1:9). Example of David's repentance (Psalm 51).
  - `[Brief Illustration Concept: Kintsugi - Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, making the repaired piece more beautiful. God's grace can restore broken lives.]`
