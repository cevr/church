### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with a question: What comes to mind when you hear the word 'church'?
  Building? People? Denomination? **(RQ)**
- Introduce the core promise: Jesus' declaration in Matthew 16:18.
- State Purpose: To explore _from Scripture_ who builds the church, what it's
  built on, who it includes, and its ultimate security.
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & Matt 16:18]

### Section 1: The Divine Architect & Foundation (10 min)

- **Christ, the Sole Builder & Owner:**
  - "_I_ will build _My_ church" (Matt 16:18a). Emphasize Christ's active role
    and ownership.
  - He didn't delegate this primary task. **(RQ)** What does His ownership imply
    for how the church should operate?
  - [Whiteboard: I WILL BUILD MY CHURCH (Matt 16:18)]
- **The True Rock (Foundation):**
  - Context of Matt 16: Peter's confession (v. 16) - "Thou art the Christ, the
    Son of the living God."
  - The "rock" (petra - large bedrock) is Christ Himself, the truth Peter
    confessed, not Peter (petros - small stone).
  - Supporting Scripture: 1 Corinthians 3:11 - "For other foundation can no man
    lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ."
  - [Whiteboard: FOUNDATION = CHRIST (1 Cor 3:11)]
  - Supporting Scripture: Ephesians 2:20 - Christ as the "chief corner stone."
  - Briefly address/refute papal succession claims based on the textual
    distinction (petros/petra) and 1 Cor 3:11.
  - [Aside: Like building a house, the foundation determines everything. A
    faulty foundation (anything other than Christ) guarantees eventual collapse,
    no matter how impressive the structure looks.]

### Section 2: The Living Stones of the Temple (12 min) [*]

- **Who Comprises the Church?**
  - Not just a building or organization, but saved individuals.
  - Scripture: 1 Peter 2:4-5 - "To whom coming, as unto a living stone... Ye
    also, as lively [living] stones, are built up a spiritual house..."
  - [Whiteboard: CHURCH = SAVED PEOPLE ('Living Stones' - 1 Pet 2:5)]
  - Emphasis on individual connection to Christ, the foundation.
- **The Call to Character Growth:**
  - As 'living stones,' we are called to conform to the Foundation, Christ.
  - Scripture: Ephesians 2:21-22 - "In whom all the building fitly framed
    together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: In whom ye also are
    builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit."
  - [Whiteboard: Goal: Grow -> Holy Temple (Eph 2:21)]
  - Connection to practical living: How does being a 'living stone' affect our
    daily choices? **(RQ)** (Connect to 2 Peter 1:5-8 - adding virtue,
    knowledge, etc.)
  - [Illustration Concept (from 1 Pet 2:5): Stones in a building must be shaped
    and fitted. Our character transformation 'fits' us into God's spiritual
    house.]
- **Personal Salvation Requirement:**
  - One becomes part of this spiritual house only by receiving Christ personally
    (John 1:12).
  - Life must be built _upon_ Christ (Matt 7:24-27 - wise man built on the
    rock).

### Section 3: Security Against the Gates of Hell (12 min)

- **The Promise of Prevailing:**
  - "...and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." (Matt 16:18b).
  - This is Christ's guarantee of the Church's ultimate victory and endurance.
- **Understanding the 'Gates of Hell':**
  - Not just death or Hades, but the organized forces and strategies of Satan
    against God's people.
  - Scripture: Ephesians 6:12 - "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
    against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness
    of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
  - [Whiteboard: Gates of Hell = Organized Evil Forces (Eph 6:12)]
  - Connects directly to the Great Controversy theme: Satan's ongoing war
    against Christ and His followers (Rev 12:17).
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture, standing firm
    against the 'gates of hell'.]
- **Endurance Through Persecution:**
  - The promise isn't absence of attack, but ultimate victory despite attack.
  - The Church will face opposition until Christ returns (Matt 24:9-13).
  - Scripture: John 10:28-29 - Christ's sheep are secure in His and the Father's
    hand.
  - [Whiteboard: Security = Ultimate Victory, Not Absence of Attack (John
    10:28-29)]
  - How does this promise provide hope and encourage perseverance, especially in
    challenging times? **(RQ)**

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap Key Truths:**
  - Christ is the Builder and Owner.
  - Christ is the only Foundation.
  - The Church is composed of 'living stones' - saved individuals connected to
    Him.
  - The Church is secure and will ultimately prevail over all opposition.
- **Practical Takeaways:**
  - **Build Your Life on the Rock:** Ensure your personal faith rests solely on
    Christ (Matt 7:24-27).
  - **Be an Active 'Living Stone':** Participate in the Church's life and
    mission (Eph 4:16). Grow in character, conforming to the Foundation.
  - **Stand Firm with Hope:** Recognize the spiritual battle (Eph 6:12), but
    rest in Christ's promise of security (Matt 16:18). Don't fear the 'gates of
    hell'.
- **Final Invitation:** Invitation to accept Christ as Savior and Foundation,
  and to commit to being an active, faithful part of His unshakeable Church.
- **Closing Prayer:** Thanking God for Christ the Foundation, asking for
  strength to be faithful 'living stones' and for assurance in His promise of
  victory.
