### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with a brief scenario: Feeling overwhelmed by life's battles (spiritual,
  personal).
- Introduce the concept: Prayer isn't passive; it's active spiritual warfare.
- **(RQ)** How often do we see prayer as our _first_ resort in trouble, not the
  last?
- State the study's purpose: To explore the biblical mandate and power of prayer
  in securing spiritual victory.
- Introduce Central Verse: Exodus 17:11.
  `[Write on board: Exodus 17:11 - Hands Up = Victory / Hands Down = Defeat]`

### Section 1: The Battleground & Intercession (10 min)

- **The Model of Intercession:** Exodus 17:8-13
  - Describe the scene: Joshua fighting below, Moses praying above.
  - Emphasize the direct link: Moses' prayer _directly_ impacted the battle's
    outcome (Ex. 17:11).
  - **(RQ)** Who is fighting _our_ battles while we pray? (Christ our
    Intercessor - Heb 7:25)
  - **The Need for Support:** Aaron and Hur supporting Moses' hands (Ex. 17:12).
    - Point: Intercessory prayer can be tiring; we need mutual support.
    - `[Write on board: Intercession (Ex 17) + Support (Aaron/Hur) = Sustained Victory]`
  - **The Banner of God:** Jehovah Nissi - The Lord is My Banner (Ex. 17:15).
    - Point: Consistent, supported intercessory prayer raises God's banner of
      protection and victory over us.
    - `[Brief Illustration/Analogy: Imagine soldiers fighting fiercely on the ground (like Joshua). Their success depends heavily on the 'air support' – the planes providing cover, intelligence, and firepower from above (like Moses' prayer). When the air support is strong and consistent, the ground troops advance. When it falters, they are vulnerable. Our prayers are like calling in that vital air support for the spiritual battles we and others face.]`

### Section 2: Vigilance vs. Neglect (12 min) [*]

- **The Call to Vigilance:** Ephesians 6:18
  - Read verse: "Praying always... watching thereunto with all perseverance..."
  - Point: Prayer requires spiritual alertness, awareness of the enemy's
    tactics, and persistence.
  - `[Write on board: Eph 6:18 -> Pray Always + Watch Always = Spiritual Readiness]`
  - **(RQ)** What does it mean to be spiritually 'watchful' or 'alert' in our
    prayer life today?
- **The Danger of Prayerlessness:** Matthew 26:40-41
  - Context: Disciples sleeping in Gethsemane during Christ's agony.
  - Jesus' words: "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
    indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak." (Matt 26:41)
  - Point: Prayerlessness leads directly to spiritual weakness and failure when
    temptation/trial comes.
  - `[Write on board: Matt 26:41 -> Prayerlessness = Vulnerability to Temptation/Defeat]`
  - **(RQ)** How does neglecting prayer weaken our 'spiritual muscles' for daily
    battles?
- `[Aside: Our private prayer closets are the training grounds for public victories. Neglect the training, and we shouldn't be surprised by failure in the field.]`

### Section 3: Authority, Unity & Testimony (12 min)

- **Praying with Authority:** Luke 10:19
  - Read verse: "Behold, I give unto you power... over all the power of the
    enemy..."
  - Point: Believers are delegated authority through Christ over demonic forces.
    Prayer is a primary way we exercise this.
  - `[Write on board: Luke 10:19 -> Prayer + Faith = Exercising Delegated Authority]`
  - **(RQ)** Do we pray defensively, or with the confidence of the authority
    Christ has given us?
- **The Power of Corporate Prayer:** Acts 4:23-31
  - Context: Believers praying together after Peter and John were threatened.
  - Result: Boldness, Holy Spirit filling, speaking God's Word (Acts 4:31).
  - Point: There's unique power when believers unite in prayer for God's
    purposes. We cannot rely only on a few 'super-intercessors'.
  - `[Write on board: Acts 4:31 -> Corporate Prayer = Boldness + Power]`
- **Praying in God's Will & Sharing Testimony:** 1 John 5:14-15; Psalm 78:4-7
  - Point (1 John 5): Confidence comes from praying according to God's revealed
    will/purposes.
  - Point (Psalm 78): Recording and sharing God's answers (testimonies)
    strengthens faith for us and the next generation.
  - `[Write on board: Psalm 78 -> Testimony = Faith Building (Present & Future)]`
  - **(RQ)** How can we be more intentional about sharing answered prayers to
    encourage others?
  - `[Aside: Keeping a prayer journal isn't just for remembering requests; it's building a personal Ebenezer, a record of God's faithfulness that fuels future trust, just as the Israelites were told to recount God's deeds.]`

  together.
