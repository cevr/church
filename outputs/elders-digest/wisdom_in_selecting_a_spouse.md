### Introduction (5 min)

*   **The Weight of the Choice:** One of life's most significant decisions, impacting happiness, spiritual journey, and eternity.
*   **Common Pitfalls:** Worldly focus on fleeting qualities vs. God's focus on eternal character.
*   **Goal:** To explore biblical wisdom (primarily Proverbs) for making this crucial choice.
*   **(RQ)** How seriously do we consider God's counsel in this area compared to cultural pressures?
*   [Write on board: Marriage Choice = Lifelong Impact (Prov 12:4)]

### Section 1: God's Design & The Stakes (8 min)

*   **God's Intention: Permanence**
    *   Marriage designed to be lifelong (Matt 19:6). [Whiteboard: Matt 19:6 - "What God has joined... let not man separate."]
    *   God's view on divorce: He hates it (Mal 2:16). Why? It breaks covenant, causes pain.
    *   **(RQ)** Does our view of marriage align with God's standard of permanence, even before we enter it?
*   **The Potential Blessing:**
    *   A virtuous spouse is a crown, a source of honor (Prov 12:4a).
    *   Finding a godly spouse is finding a good thing, obtaining favor from the Lord (Prov 18:22). [Whiteboard: Prov 18:22 - Good Thing = Favor from LORD]
*   **The Potential Misery:**
    *   A shameful spouse is rottenness to the bones (Prov 12:4b).
    *   A contentious spouse brings constant strife (Implied Prov 21:19 - better to dwell in wilderness).
    *   **(RQ)** Are we considering both the potential blessing *and* the potential long-term pain based on character?

### Section 2: Seeking God & Prioritizing Character (10 min)

*   **Essential First Step: Seek God's Guidance**
    *   A prudent spouse is *from the Lord* (Prov 19:14). This requires prayer, patience, seeking His will.
    *   [Whiteboard: Prov 19:14 - Prudent Spouse = FROM THE LORD]
    *   **(RQ)** How actively are we praying for wisdom and guidance *before* emotional attachment clouds judgment?
*   **Character Over Charisma/Appearance**
    *   Charm is deceitful, beauty is vain (Prov 31:30a). These fade and can mislead.
    *   The truly praiseworthy quality: Fear of the Lord (Prov 31:30b). [Whiteboard: Character > Appearance (Prov 31:30)]
    *   A beautiful person lacking discretion is like a gold ring in a pig's snout (Prov 11:22) - beauty wasted without wisdom/character.
    *   A wise woman builds her house (Prov 14:1) - character contributes to stability.
*   [Aside: "Choosing a partner based mainly on looks or charm is like buying a house based only on the paint color. It might look good initially, but you have no idea if the foundation is crumbling until you're living inside."]

### Section 3: Observing Character in Action [*] (12 min)

*   **Wisdom Requires Observation:** Character is revealed through consistent actions, not just words.
*   **Key Areas to Observe (Based on Proverbs):**
    *   **Treatment of Vulnerable:** How do they treat animals/those who can't benefit them? (Prov 12:10 - Righteous regards life of his animal). [Whiteboard: Observe: Compassion (Prov 12:10)]
    *   **Teachability:** Are they wise in their own eyes, or willing to listen to counsel? (Prov 12:15 - Way of fool right in own eyes, wise listens). **(RQ)** Can they receive correction?
    *   **Choice of Friends:** Who are their close companions? They shape character. (Prov 13:20 - Walk with wise = wise; companion of fools = destroyed). [Whiteboard: Observe: Friends (Prov 13:20)]
    *   **Temperament:** Are they quick-tempered or patient? (Prov 14:29 - Slow to wrath = great understanding). **(RQ)** How do they handle frustration/disagreement?
    *   **Integrity/Greed:** How do they handle money/business? (Prov 15:27 - Greedy troubles own house; hates bribes = lives).
    *   **Self-Control (Speech):** Do they control their tongue? (Prov 17:27-28 - Spares words = knowledge; restrains lips = prudent). [Whiteboard: Observe: Self-Control (Prov 17:27)]
    *   **Compassion for Needy:** Do they care for the poor? (Prov 21:13 - Stops ears to cry of poor = will cry himself, not heard).
*   [Analogy (from Prov 14:1): Character is the building material of the home (marriage). Wise choices build strong; foolish choices lead to ruin.]

### Section 4: Red Flags & Warnings (5 min)

*   **Specific Warnings from Proverbs:** God's Word gives clear danger signs.
*   **Avoid Entanglement With:**
    *   **The Immoral/Unfaithful:** Playing with fire leads to burns (Prov 6:27-29). Avoid those known for sexual looseness.
    *   **The Quick-Tempered:** Anger is contagious and destructive (Prov 22:24-25 - Make no friendship with angry man). [Whiteboard: Warning: Anger (Prov 22:24)]
    *   **The Addicted (e.g., Alcohol):** Leads to woe, sorrow, strife (Prov 23:29-30). Addiction reveals deeper character issues.
*   **(RQ)** Are we ignoring clear biblical warnings because of attraction or loneliness?
*   [Aside: "Sometimes we think we can 'fix' someone or that these issues won't affect *us*. Proverbs warns us that associating with certain character flaws inevitably brings negative consequences into our own lives."]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

*   **Recap:** Marriage is God's design, meant for blessing and permanence. Choosing wisely requires seeking God, prioritizing character (fear of the Lord) over superficiality, careful observation, and heeding biblical warnings.
*   **The Foundation:** A shared commitment to Christ and His principles is the only sure foundation (Amos 3:3 - Can two walk together unless agreed?).
*   **Actionable Step:** Commit today to praying for wisdom (James 1:5) whether choosing now or preparing for the future. Study God's Word (especially Proverbs) for guidance.
*   **Invitation:** Choose to build your future marriage on the rock of godly character, not the sand of fleeting appearances. Trust God's wisdom above your own feelings or worldly advice (Prov 3:5-6).
*   [Final Whiteboard Point: Seek God First (Matt 6:33) -> He Guides (Prov 19:14)]
