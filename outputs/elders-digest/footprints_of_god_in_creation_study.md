### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Where did everything come from? Random chance or purposeful design? A
  fundamental question.
- Concept: God left His "footprints" or signature on His creation.
- Objective: To trace these footprints in the natural world, confirming the
  biblical account and strengthening our faith in the Creator.
- Central Verse Focus: Romans 1:20 - God's invisible attributes (power,
  divinity) are made visible through creation.
  `[Write on board: Romans 1:20 - Invisible -> Clearly Seen via Creation]`
- The evidence makes belief reasonable and unbelief accountable.

### Main Content Section 1: The Heavens Declare (10 min) - Biblical Foundation

- **Key Text:** Psalm 19:1 - "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the
  firmament sheweth his handywork."
  - `[Whiteboard: Ps 19:1 - Heavens -> Glory -> Handiwork]`
- **Exploration:**
  - Vastness and Order: Precision of orbits, galaxies, physical laws governing
    the universe.
  - **RQ:** Could such intricate, mathematical order arise spontaneously from
    chaos? (Ps 19:1)
  - Universal Testimony: This declaration needs no translator; it speaks to all
    humanity (Ps 19:2-4).
- **Contrast:** The complexity points away from random chance towards an
  intelligent source.
- **Illustration Concept:** Imagine finding a perfectly functioning watch on a
  beach. Would you assume the waves and sand assembled it by chance? How much
  more complex is the universe? (Relates to Ps 19:1)

### Main Content Section 2: Earthly Witness & Human Design [*] (15 min) - Theological Unpacking

- **Earth's Benevolent Design:**
  - **Key Text:** Acts 14:17 - "Nevertheless he left not himself without
    witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful
    seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."
    - `[Whiteboard: Acts 14:17 - God's Witness = Rain, Seasons, Food, Gladness]`
  - Focus: Systems essential for life – water cycle, seasons, ecosystems,
    provision of food.
  - Implication: Design shows not just power, but _goodness_ and care (Acts
    14:17).
  - **RQ:** How does recognizing God's hand in providing rain and food shift our
    perspective from entitlement to gratitude? (Acts 14:17)
- **The Pinnacle of Earthly Creation: Humanity:**
  - **Key Text:** Psalm 139:14 - "I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and
    wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right
    well."
    - `[Whiteboard: Ps 139:14 - Fearfully & Wonderfully Made]`
  - Focus: Intricacy of the human body – DNA, brain function, interconnected
    systems.
  - Concept: Irreducible complexity – systems where all parts must be present
    simultaneously to function. Points strongly against gradual evolution.
  - **RQ:** If we admire human artistry and engineering, how can we not stand in
    awe of the Divine Engineer who designed us? (Ps 139:14)
- **[Aside:** "Just as a complex watch points undeniably to a watchmaker, the
  intricate design woven into every cell, every ecosystem, shouts of a Master
  Designer. To attribute this to mere chance requires more 'faith' than
  believing in God."]

### Main Content Section 3: Creation, Faith, and the Creator's Memorial (10 min) - Practical Application

- **From Evidence to Faith:**
  - **Key Texts:** Hebrews 3:4 & Romans 1:20
    - Hebrews 3:4: Simple logic – buildings have builders; creation has a
      Creator. `[Whiteboard: Heb 3:4 - House -> Builder :: All Things -> GOD]`
    - Romans 1:20: The evidence is clear, leaving humanity "without excuse."
  - Connecting Evidence & Faith: Nature provides rational support for faith.
    It's not a blind leap but a step onto solid ground. (Ref. _Steps to Christ_,
    p. 105 - evidence given to confirm faith).
  - **RQ:** Seeing this overwhelming evidence (Rom 1:20), how does it personally
    strengthen your confidence in God and His Word?
- **The Creator's Sign & Last Day Relevance:**
  - **Key Texts:** Genesis 2:1-3; Exodus 20:8-11; Revelation 14:7
    - God established a _memorial_ of His completed creation: The Seventh-day
      Sabbath. `[Whiteboard: Creation -> Sabbath Memorial (Gen 2:1-3)]`
    - Exodus 20:11 explicitly links Sabbath observance to God's six-day creation
      act. It's a sign of acknowledging Him _as_ Creator.
    - Revelation 14:7: The First Angel's Message calls the world back to worship
      the _Creator_ – a direct counter to evolutionary theories and the denial
      of God prevalent in the last days (Great Controversy context).
  - **RQ:** If we accept the evidence for God as Creator (Rom 1:20), isn't
    honoring His chosen memorial of that act (Sabbath - Ex 20:11) a vital
    expression of our allegiance, especially in light of the final call to
    worship Him? (Rev 14:7)
- **[Aside:** "In a world increasingly adrift from its Creator, recognizing His
  signature in nature isn't just an intellectual exercise; it's reclaiming
  foundational truth. The Sabbath becomes a weekly anchor, reminding us Who made
  us and Who sustains us."]
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
  1.  **Observe Intentionally:** This week, take 5-10 minutes outdoors (even
      just looking out a window) specifically to identify one aspect of nature's
      design (a bird, a tree, the clouds) and consciously thank God for His
      handiwork (Ps 19:1, Rom 1:20).
  2.  **Practice Gratitude for Provision:** Before one meal each day this week,
      pause to specifically thank God for the elements involved in providing
      that food – the rain, the soil, the seasons He ordained (Acts 14:17).
  3.  **Reflect on the Memorial:** During the next Sabbath hours, consciously
      connect the rest and worship with God's act of Creation, perhaps by
      reading Genesis 1-2 or Exodus 20:8-11, acknowledging Him as the Creator
      who deserves our worship (Gen 2:1-3, Ex 20:11, Rev 14:7).

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen how God's "footprints" are undeniable in the cosmos
  (Ps 19:1), in the life-sustaining systems of earth (Acts 14:17), and in our
  own intricate design (Ps 139:14).
- **Revisit Central Verse:** Romans 1:20 confirms this evidence is clear,
  revealing God's power and divine nature, leaving us accountable. The evidence
  points logically to a Creator (Heb 3:4).
- **The Choice:** Creation testifies. The question isn't whether the evidence
  exists, but how we will respond to it. Will we acknowledge the Creator? Will
  we express gratitude for His goodness?
- **Invitation:** If the evidence of God in creation resonates with you today,
  consider taking those small steps: observe His handiwork, express gratitude,
  and reflect on the meaning of His Creatorship, perhaps especially through His
  appointed memorial, the Sabbath (Ex 20:11). Let the "things that are made"
  draw you closer to the One who made them. Let's choose to see His footprints
  and follow where they lead.
