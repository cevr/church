### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Begin with a universal feeling - the need for guidance, safety,
  provision. **(RQ)** Who do you turn to when you feel lost or overwhelmed?
- Introduce Psalm 23 as a beloved passage offering profound comfort.
- Connect Psalm 23's Shepherd imagery directly to Jesus Christ, the Good
  Shepherd (John 10).
- **Central Theme:** Today we explore the legacy of the Good Shepherd â€“ His
  personal care, provision, guidance, comfort, and eternal promise, as revealed
  in Scripture.
- [Write on board: Psalm 23 & John 10 = Jesus, Our Good Shepherd]

### Main Content 1: The Shepherd's Personal Care (10 min)

- **Focus Verse:** Psalm 23:1 - "The Lord _is_ my shepherd; I shall not want."
  - Emphasis on "_my_ shepherd" - not just _a_ shepherd, but a personal
    relationship. (John 10:14)
  - "I shall not want" - Assurance of complete provision based on the Shepherd's
    character, not our circumstances.
- **Supporting Verse:** John 10:14-15 - "I am the good shepherd, and know my
  sheep, and am known of mine... and I lay down my life for the sheep."
  - He _knows_ us individually. Intimate knowledge.
  - His ultimate act of care: laying down His life.
- [Write on board: Ps 23:1 -> "MY Shepherd" = Personal Relationship]
- [Write on board: John 10:14-15 -> Knows Sheep + Lays Down Life = Ultimate
  Care]
- **Application:** This isn't abstract theology; it's a daily reality. **(RQ)**
  Do we live with the confidence that comes from being personally known and
  cared for by the Good Shepherd?
- **Action Step:** Acknowledge Him as _your_ Shepherd in prayer this week,
  specifically thanking Him for His personal knowledge and sacrifice (John
  10:14-15).

### Main Content 2: The Shepherd's Provision and Restoration (12 min) [*]

- **Focus Verses:** Psalm 23:2-3 - "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
  he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in
  the paths of righteousness for his name's sake."
- **Provision:**
  - 'Green pastures' - Spiritual nourishment (God's Word). (cf. Matt 4:4)
  - 'Still waters' - Spiritual peace, refreshment (Holy Spirit). (cf. John
    7:37-39)
  - [Write on board: Ps 23:2 -> Green Pastures (Nourishment) + Still Waters
    (Peace)]
- **Restoration:**
  - 'Restoreth my soul' - Healing from sin's damage, weariness, discouragement.
    Bringing us back to spiritual health. (cf. Jer 31:25)
  - [Write on board: Ps 23:3a -> Restores Soul = Spiritual Healing]
- **Guidance:**
  - 'Paths of righteousness' - Leading in His will, moral uprightness, right
    living. (cf. Prov 4:11)
  - 'For his name's sake' - His guidance reflects His character; our following
    Him brings Him glory. (cf. 1 Cor 10:31)
  - [Write on board: Ps 23:3b -> Paths of Righteousness = Godly Guidance (His
    Character)]
- **Bridging:** **(RQ)** Where do we typically seek rest, satisfaction, or
  guidance? Are we looking to the Shepherd's provision (Word, Spirit) or worldly
  substitutes?
- [Brief Analogy (from Ps 23:3): Shepherd guiding sheep away from dangerous
  cliffs or poisonous weeds = God guiding us away from sin/error through His
  Word and Spirit.]
- **Action Steps:** 1) Spend time in 'green pastures' (Bible study) daily. 2)
  Seek 'still waters' (prayerful communion) for peace. 3) Ask God to 'restore
  your soul' where needed and lead you in 'paths of righteousness'.

### Main Content 3: The Shepherd's Presence in Trials (12 min)

- **Focus Verse:** Psalm 23:4 - "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the
  shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
  staff they comfort me."
- **The Reality of Trials:**
  - 'Valley of the shadow of death' - Represents life's darkest times: grief,
    loss, severe trials, temptation, persecution, even the process of dying.
    (cf. Job 10:21-22)
  - It's a 'walk through', not a permanent residence. (cf. 2 Cor 4:17)
- **The Antidote to Fear:**
  - 'I will fear no evil: for _thou art with me_' - The cure for fear isn't the
    absence of danger, but the presence of the Shepherd. (cf. Isa 41:10)
  - [Write on board: Ps 23:4 -> Fear <-> God's Presence]
- **The Tools of Comfort:**
  - 'Thy rod' - Symbol of authority, defense against predators (protection).
    (cf. Micah 7:14)
  - 'Thy staff' - Symbol of guidance, support, rescue (gentle leading). (cf. Lev
    27:32 - used for counting/caring)
  - [Write on board: Rod (Protection) + Staff (Guidance) = Comfort]
- **Application:** **(RQ)** When facing deep trials ('valleys'), is our
  immediate focus on the darkness, or on the Shepherd who walks _with_ us?
  **(RQ)** How does remembering His 'rod' (power to protect) and 'staff' (power
  to guide) bring comfort according to this verse?
- [Aside: Like a child holding their father's hand in a dark room, the fear
  doesn't vanish the darkness, but the presence removes the terror. God's
  presence doesn't always remove the trial, but it removes the paralyzing fear
  because He is with us (Ps 23:4).]
- **Action Step:** When fear arises this week, consciously recall Psalm 23:4.
  Pray, "Lord, You are with me; Your rod and staff comfort me," and ask Him to
  make His presence real to you.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen the incredible legacy of our Good Shepherd, Jesus
  Christ, through David's inspired psalm and Jesus' own words.
  - He offers _personal_ care, knowing us by name (Ps 23:1, John 10:14).
  - He provides spiritual _nourishment_ and _restoration_ (Ps 23:2-3).
  - He guides us in _righteousness_ for His glory (Ps 23:3).
  - He walks _with us_ through the darkest valleys, offering comfort and
    protection (Ps 23:4).
- **The Ultimate Promise:** The psalm doesn't end in the valley. It culminates
  in an eternal perspective.
  - **Focus Verse:** Psalm 23:6 - "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all
    the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever."
  - 'Goodness and mercy' - His constant companions, pursuing us.
  - 'Dwell in the house of the Lord for ever' - The ultimate hope: eternal life
    in God's presence. This is secured by the Shepherd who laid down His life
    (John 10:15) and rose again.
  - [Write on board: Ps 23:6 -> Goodness & Mercy (Now) + House of the Lord
    (Forever)]
- **Invitation:** The Good Shepherd knows you, loves you, and laid down His life
  for you. He offers provision, guidance, comfort, and an eternal home. **(RQ)**
  Have you accepted Him as _your_ personal Shepherd?
- **Appeal:** If you haven't, or if you've wandered, the Shepherd is calling you
  today (cf. Rev 3:20). Choose to follow Him, to trust His care, to rest in His
  provision, and to look forward to dwelling in His house forever (Ps 23:6). Let
  His goodness and mercy follow you, starting today. Make Psalm 23:1 your
  personal testimony: "The Lord _is_ my shepherd."
