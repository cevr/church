### Introduction (5 min)
-   Greeting & Prayer
-   Brief overview: Success at Jericho vs. Failure at Ai. Why the stark contrast? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce theme: How hidden, individual sin can impact the entire community of faith.
-   Central Verse Reading: Joshua 7:11-12. Emphasize God's direct connection between sin and withheld blessing/power.
-   [Write on board: Joshua 7 - Sin in the Camp]

### Section 1: The Unexpected Defeat (Joshua 7:1-5) (8 min)
-   **Context:** Victory at Jericho (Joshua 6) - God's power demonstrated.
-   **The Plan for Ai:** Seems small, easy target (Josh 7:3).
    -   Element of self-sufficiency? Underestimating the spiritual battle? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: Self-Sufficiency vs. God-Reliance]
-   **The Shocking Result:** Defeat and discouragement (Josh 7:4-5).
    -   Why couldn't they stand? (Hinted in v. 1, explained later).
-   **Achan's Secret Sin:** (Josh 7:1, 20-21) - Covetousness leads to disobedience.
    -   Took of the "accursed thing" (Hebrew: *cherem*).
    -   `[Aside: The "accursed thing" wasn't just valuable loot; it was devoted to God, often for destruction, signifying complete separation from pagan practices and reliance on God alone. Taking it was a direct violation of God's specific command for Jericho (Josh 6:18-19).]`

### Section 2: God's Diagnosis - Sin's Impact (Joshua 7:10-12) (10 min)
-   **Joshua's Distress:** (Josh 7:6-9) - He seeks God, confused by the defeat.
-   **God's Clear Answer:** (Josh 7:10-12) - The problem isn't military strategy; it's sin within the camp.
    -   [Write on board: Sin -> Broken Covenant -> Loss of God's Presence/Power]
    -   Note the progression: sinned -> transgressed covenant -> taken accursed thing -> stolen -> dissembled (deceived) -> put among own stuff (v. 11). Sin rarely stays isolated.
-   **Corporate Effect:** "Israel hath sinned..." (v. 11) - One man's sin attributed to the nation. "Therefore the children of Israel could not stand..." (v. 12).
    -   **Illustration:** Think of a body. If one small part, like a toe, gets infected and is ignored, the whole body can become sick and weakened. Achan's sin was an infection in the body of Israel.
-   **God's Ultimatum:** "Neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you." (v. 12) - Holiness is required for God's presence.

### Section 3: The Necessary Response (Joshua 7:13, 19-26) [*] (10 min)
-   **God's Command:** "Sanctify yourselves..." (Josh 7:13). Prepare for purification.
    -   [Write on board: Sanctify -> Identify -> Confess -> Remove]
-   **The Process of Identification:** Casting lots reveals Achan (Josh 7:14-18). God brings hidden things to light.
-   **The Call to Confession:** Joshua urges Achan, "give glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him" (Josh 7:19).
-   **Achan's Confession:** (Josh 7:20-21) - Admits seeing, coveting, taking, hiding.
-   **Removing the Sin:** The stolen items and Achan (and his household, implicated) are removed and judged (Josh 7:22-26).
    -   `[Aside: The judgment seems harsh to modern ears, but it underscores the absolute seriousness of disobeying a direct command tied to covenant holiness and the potential for sin to spread generationally if not dealt with decisively.]`
    -   This act restored the possibility of God's presence and blessing.

### Section 4: Personal & Corporate Application (2 Cor 13:5; 2 Chron 7:14) (7 min)
-   **Need/Question:** How do we prevent "sin in the camp" today, in our own lives and church community? **(RQ)** How do we ensure God's presence isn't hindered among us?
-   **Biblical Principle (Self-Examination):** "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves." (2 Cor 13:5a). We are responsible for personal spiritual inventory.
    -   [Write on board: 2 Cor 13:5 - Examine Yourselves]
-   **Biblical Principle (Corporate Repentance):** "If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land." (2 Chron 7:14). There's a path for restoration.
    -   [Write on board: 2 Chron 7:14 - Humble, Pray, Seek, Turn -> Hear, Forgive, Heal]
-   **Bridging:** Like Israel, our effectiveness for God (individually and corporately) is tied to our faithfulness and holiness. Hidden sin still weakens us and grieves the Holy Spirit.
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    1.  **Personal Inventory:** Set aside 15 minutes this week to prayerfully examine your heart using 2 Cor 13:5. Ask God honestly: "Is there any 'accursed thing' (known sin, compromise, cherished idol) in my life hindering my relationship with You or my witness?"
    2.  **Humble Prayer:** Incorporate the elements of 2 Chron 7:14 into your personal or family prayer time: consciously humble yourself, specifically pray for forgiveness and cleansing for yourself and the church, seek God's guidance through His Word, and identify one specific "wicked way" (habit, attitude) to actively turn from with God's help.
    3.  **Seek Accountability (Wisely):** If convicted of a specific sin, consider confessing appropriately (to God always, and to a trusted spiritual mentor or friend if it involves others or requires support – James 5:16).

### Conclusion & Invitation (5 min)
-   Recap: Achan's story is a sobering reminder that personal choices have wider consequences. Hidden sin hinders God's power and presence.
-   Reiterate God's desire for holiness and His provision for forgiveness and restoration (2 Chron 7:14).
-   **Invitation:** As we close, let's reflect personally. Is there any 'Achan' in our hearts? Any hidden thing hindering God's blessing in our lives or in our church family? God isn't looking to condemn, but to restore. Let's accept His gracious invitation found in 2 Chronicles 7:14 – to humble ourselves, pray, seek His face, and turn from anything displeasing to Him. He promises to hear, forgive, and heal. Will you commit today, right now in your heart, to examining your life and allowing the Holy Spirit to remove anything that stands between you and God, for your sake and the sake of our community?
-   Final Prayer asking for searching hearts, forgiveness, and cleansing.
