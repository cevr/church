### Introduction (6 min)

- Prayer: More than a ritual, it's relationship.
- Psalm 119: A deep dive into a life lived with God, expressed through prayer.
  - Longest chapter, focused on God's Word and the believer's response.
- Goal: Explore key elements of the Psalmist's prayer life in Psalm 119 for our
  own growth.
- **RQ:** How can this ancient prayer guide transform our connection with God
  today?
- [Write on board: Prayer = Relationship (Psalm 119)]

### Section 1: My Portion - The Foundation of Prayer (8 min)

- **The Core Relationship:** Finding Identity in God.
  - Psalm 119:57 - "Thou art my portion, O LORD..."
  - Meaning: God is my inheritance, my sufficiency, my ultimate value.
  - [Write on board: God = My Portion (Ps 119:57)]
  - This recognition builds true self-worth, grounded not in self, but in Him.
  - **RQ:** If God is truly our 'portion', how does that change what we worry
    about or strive for? (cf. Matt 6:33)
- **Commitment Flows from Relationship:** "...I have said that I would keep thy
  words."
  - Obedience isn't earning favor, but a response to His value in our lives.
  - Prayer is communion with our 'Portion'.

### Section 2: The Sincere Approach - Faith & Promises [*] (10 min)

- **Sincerity is Essential:** Wholehearted Seeking.
  - Psalm 119:58 - "I intreated thy favour with my whole heart..."
  - Psalm 119:145 - "I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD..."
  - [Write on board: Prayer Requires: Sincerity (Ps 119:58, 145)]
  - God desires authenticity, not just words. (cf. Matt 6:7)
  - **RQ:** What does 'wholehearted' prayer look like practically, beyond just
    feeling emotional?
- **Faith Claims God's Word:** Praying the Promises.
  - Psalm 119:49 - "Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
    caused me to hope."
  - Prayer isn't just asking, but reminding God (and ourselves) of His
    commitments.
  - [Write on board: Prayer Requires: Faith in Promises (Ps 119:49)]
  - [Analogy (from verse): Holding God's signed check (His promise) and
    presenting it for payment (claiming in faith)].
  - Requires knowing His Word to claim His promises.

### Section 3: The Responsive Life - Repentance & Praise (10 min)

- **Continuous Repentance:** Aligning with God's Ways.
  - Psalm 119:59 - "I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy
    testimonies."
  - Psalm 119:60 - "I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments."
  - [Write on board: Prayer Leads To: Repentance & Action (Ps 119:59-60)]
  - Prayer reveals misalignment; true faith responds with change.
  - Repentance isn't just sorrow, but turning _towards_ God's ways.
  - **RQ:** How often do our prayers lead to immediate, practical changes in our
    direction, like the Psalmist?
- **Praise in All Circumstances:** A Sacrifice of Thanksgiving.
  - Psalm 119:62 - "At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
    thy righteous judgments."
  - Even in darkness ('midnight'), praise is possible and powerful.
  - Focusing on God's character (righteous judgments) fuels praise.
  - [Write on board: Prayer Includes: Praise, Even at Midnight (Ps 119:62)]
  - [Aside: Praising God when things are difficult is like exercising faith
    muscles; it strengthens our reliance on His unchanging character, not our
    fluctuating circumstances.]

### Section 4: The Guarded Heart & Steadfast Grip (5 min)

- **Recognizing God's Love:** The Motivation and Comfort.
  - Psalm 119:76 - "Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
    according to thy word..."
  - Psalm 119:132 - "Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest
    to do unto those that love thy name."
  - Prayer acknowledges our need for His constant love and mercy.
  - [Whiteboard: Anchor: God's Merciful Kindness (Ps 119:76, 132)]
- **Guarding the Source:** Heart and Speech.
  - Psalm 119:169 - "Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
    understanding according to thy word."
  - Prayer seeks understanding to align inner thoughts and outward expressions.
  - Need to guard heart motives (Prov 4:23) and speech (Ps 141:3).
  - [Reference EGW: Importance of pure thoughts and controlled speech as
    evidence of heart-work.]
  - [Write Question: How does prayer help guard my heart & words? (Ps 119:169)]
- **Illustration Concept:** Holding Fast.
  - Holding firmly to God in prayer (like Jacob wrestling) enables us to hold
    onto core values derived from Him.
  - [Whiteboard: Prayer -> Holding God -> Holding Values (Honesty, Purity,
    Thoughtfulness, Honor, Character)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Psalm 119 reveals prayer as foundational relationship (My Portion),
  requiring sincerity and faith in promises, leading to repentance and praise,
  anchored in God's love, and strengthening our character.
- The Psalmist's prayer life wasn't passive; it was active, responsive, and
  transformative.
- **RQ:** Is our prayer life reflecting this kind of deep, honest, Word-based
  engagement with God?
- [Aside: Like a deep well, Psalm 119 offers endless refreshment for the praying
  soul. We've only dipped our toes in today; the invitation is to dive deeper
  personally.]
- Invitation: Commit this week to incorporating one principle from the
  Psalmist's prayer life. Perhaps claiming a specific promise (Ps 119:49),
  practicing midnight praise (Ps 119:62), or consciously turning your feet when
  convicted (Ps 119:59).
- Final thought: Let prayer be the means by which God, our Portion, shapes us
  into His likeness.
