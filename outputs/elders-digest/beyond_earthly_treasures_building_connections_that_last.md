### Introduction (5-7 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with the core idea - "It's hard to grow old alone." Briefly illustrate potential emptiness of worldly success without meaningful connection.
-   **Tension:** Worldly success vs. relational/spiritual poverty.
-   **Purpose:** Explore biblical wisdom on true wealth, lasting connections, and eternal priorities.
-   **Central Verse:** Introduce Luke 12:21. What does it mean to be rich toward self vs. rich toward God?
    -   `[Write on board: Luke 12:21 - Rich toward Self vs. Rich toward God]`
-   **Transition:** Let's examine Scripture to see how to build a life that avoids this lonely end.

### Main Content Section 1: The Vanity of Self-Focused Living (Biblical Foundation) (10 min)

-   **Focus:** Lessons from Ecclesiastes and Jesus' parable.
-   **Point 1: Companionship is God's Design (Eccl 4:9-10).**
    -   Read Eccl 4:9-10. Discuss the practical benefits: mutual help, warmth, defense.
    -   `[Write on board: Eccl 4:9-10 - Two > One (Help, Warmth, Defense)]`
    -   (RQ) How does modern culture sometimes push against this God-given need for interdependence?
-   **Point 2: Isolation Weakens (Eccl 4:11-12).**
    -   Read Eccl 4:11-12. Contrast vulnerability alone vs. strength in unity (threefold cord).
    -   `[Analogy (from Eccl 4:12): Threefold cord - You + Others + God = Strength]`
-   **Point 3: The Rich Fool's Folly (Luke 12:16-21).**
    -   Briefly recount the parable (Luke 12:16-20). Focus on the man's self-talk ("my fruits," "my barns," "my goods," "my soul") vs. God's assessment ("Thou fool").
    -   Connect directly to the Central Verse (Luke 12:21). His riches were for himself alone.
    -   `[Write Question on board (from Luke 12:21): What does it mean to be 'rich toward God'?]`

### Main Content Section 2: Where True Treasure Lies [*] (12 min)

-   **Focus:** Shifting priorities from temporal to eternal based on Scripture.
-   **Point 1: Earthly Riches are Temporary and Potentially Dangerous (Matt 6:19-20; 1 Tim 6:9-10).**
    -   Read Matt 6:19-20. Contrast vulnerability of earthly treasures vs. security of heavenly treasures.
    -   `[Write on board: Earthly Treasure (Matt 6:19) - Moth, Rust, Thieves vs. Heavenly Treasure (Matt 6:20) - Secure]`
    -   Read 1 Tim 6:9-10. Clarify: It's the *love* of money that is a root of evil, a snare leading to sorrows.
    -   (RQ) Based on 1 Tim 6:9-10, how can pursuing wealth become a spiritual trap?
-   **Point 2: Heavenly Treasure Involves the Heart's Focus (Matt 6:21).**
    -   Read Matt 6:21. "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
    -   Discuss: Our investments (time, energy, resources) reveal our heart's true location and priorities.
    -   `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Are our personal lives also embassies reflecting heavenly values and treasures?]`
    -   Connect to Character Building: Investing in faith, love, service, relationships builds heavenly treasure.

### Main Content Section 3: Building Connections That Last (Practical Application from Verses) (12 min)

-   **Focus:** Actionable steps derived directly from the studied scriptures.
-   **Point 1: Prioritize God First (Implied from Matt 6:19-21, Luke 12:21).**
    -   Revisit Luke 12:21 - Being "rich toward God" starts with putting Him first (Ref Matt 6:33).
    -   **Action Step 1:** Daily Divine Connection. Consistent prayer and Bible study builds the foundational relationship. `[Write on board: Action 1: Daily Divine Connection (Ref Matt 6:33)]`
-   **Point 2: Cultivate Godly Community (Heb 10:24-25).**
    -   Read Heb 10:24-25. Focus on the action verbs: "consider one another," "provoke unto love and good works," "not forsaking the assembling," "exhorting one another."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Heb 10:24-25 -> Provoke Love/Good Works, Assemble Together, Exhort Daily]`
    -   **Action Step 2:** Intentional Fellowship. Actively participate, encourage, and serve within the church family. `[Write on board: Action 2: Intentional Fellowship (Heb 10:25)]`
    -   (RQ) According to Hebrews 10:24, how can we thoughtfully 'provoke' (stir up) fellow believers toward love and good deeds this week?
-   **Point 3: Invest Relationally in Others (Connects Eccl 4:9-12 & Matt 6:20).**
    -   Living out Eccl 4:9-10: Be the friend who helps, supports, defends.
    -   This investment in others is part of laying up treasure in heaven (Matt 6:20).
    -   **Action Step 3:** Be the 'Second Person'. Look for opportunities to help, listen, and support someone else. `[Write on board: Action 3: Be the 'Second Person' (Eccl 4:9)]`
    -   `[Aside: Instead of spending primarily on ourselves, we can use our resources and opportunities to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love... like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. How can we repurpose worldly means for eternal connections?]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (5-8 min)

-   **Recap:** Summarize the biblical contrast: The potential loneliness of self-focused, earthly pursuits (Eccl 4, Luke 12) versus the lasting richness of a life centered on God and community (Matt 6, Heb 10).
-   **Revisit Theme:** Growing old alone (or facing eternity alone) is a tragedy avoidable through Christ.
-   **Last Day Urgency:** Connect to the nearness of Christ's return. Are we building our lives on the temporary or the eternal? (Ref Matt 7:24-27). Are our treasures secure?
-   **Final Appeal:** Based on the scriptures studied (Luke 12:21, Matt 6:19-21, Heb 10:24-25), choose today to invest in being "rich toward God." Prioritize your relationship with Him, actively engage in godly community, and invest in others.
-   **Call to Action:** Encourage commitment to one specific action step discussed, rooted in the biblical principles explored.
