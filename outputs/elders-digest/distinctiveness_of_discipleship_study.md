### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Prayer
- The Common Claim vs. The Reality: Many claim to follow Christ. (Matt 7:21)
- (RQ) But what distinguishes genuine discipleship from mere profession?
- Setting the Scene: Jesus confronts those who initially 'believed' (John
  8:30-31).
- Focus: Exploring Jesus' definition of true discipleship in John 8.
- [Write on board: What makes a TRUE disciple? (John 8)]

### Section 1: The Mark of Continuance (John 8:31) (10 min)

- **The Condition:** "IF ye continue in my word..." (John 8:31a)
  - Not just initial belief or enthusiasm.
  - Requires steadfastness, perseverance.
  - [Whiteboard: John 8:31 -> CONTINUE = ABIDE / REMAIN]
- **The Result:** "...THEN are ye my disciples indeed." (John 8:31b)
  - Authenticity proven over time.
  - (RQ) How easy is it to start strong but fade? Why is continuance the key?
- **Character as Evidence:** Sustained effort reveals true character.
  - "Character is the test of discipleship." (EGW, 5T 305)
  - It's about _being_, shaped by His Word, not just _hearing_.
  - [Concept (based on verse): Discipleship like a marathon, not a sprint.
    Requires endurance fueled by abiding in Christ's Word.]
- **Practical Link:** Daily choices to stay connected to Christ and His
  teachings.

### Section 2: The Freedom of Truth (John 8:32-36) [*] (12 min)

- **The Promise:** "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
  free." (John 8:32)
  - [Whiteboard: KNOW TRUTH (v.32) -> FREEDOM]
  - Immediate Misunderstanding: They claimed freedom through lineage (v. 33).
  - (RQ) What kind of freedom were they missing? What kind does Jesus offer?
- **The Real Bondage:** "Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin." (John
  8:34)
  - Sin as a master, enslaving the will.
  - [Write on board: SIN (v.34) = BONDAGE / SLAVERY]
- **The True Liberator:** "If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be
  free indeed." (John 8:36)
  - Freedom _from_ sin's power and guilt.
  - Freedom _to_ live in obedience and righteousness.
  - [Draw Arrow: Sin (v.34) -> Bondage -> SON (v.36) -> True Freedom]
- **Bridging to Practice:**
  - Need: Feeling trapped by habits, guilt, or worldly pressures.
  - Principle: Abiding in Christ's truth (His Word, Himself) breaks sin's hold
    (John 8:31-32, 36).
  - Action Step: Identify one area of bondage. Study relevant Bible truth about
    God's power over it. Pray specifically for Christ's liberating power based
    on John 8:36.

### Section 3: The Test of Character (John 8:37-47) (12 min)

- **Lineage vs. Likeness:** Claiming Abrahamic descent vs. doing Abraham's works
  (John 8:39).
  - Their actions (seeking to kill Jesus, v. 37, 40) contradicted their claim.
  - (RQ) Does our church affiliation or heritage automatically make us God's
    children?
  - [Whiteboard: CLAIM (v.39a) vs. ACTIONS (v.39b-40)]
- **Revealing Parentage:** Actions reveal spiritual fatherhood.
  - "Ye do the deeds of your father." (John 8:41)
  - Jesus identifies their father by their actions: lies, murder (John 8:44).
  - [Write Question: Whose 'family resemblance' do my actions show? God's (v.47)
    or the enemy's (v.44)?]
- **God's Character Reflected:** True disciples reflect God's character.
  - Meekness, humility, benevolence vs. pride, hatred (EGW, 5T 305).
  - Hearing/accepting God's words is a sign of belonging to Him (John 8:47).
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]
- **Bearing Fruit:** Living Christ's character = evidence of discipleship.
  - "If we live in accordance with Christ's character... we shall bear much
    fruit." (EGW, MR vol 21, 358 - paraphrase context).
  - [Metaphor (from verse 47): Like tuning forks - God's children resonate with
    His Word.]
- **Practical Application:**
  - Need: Disconnect between professed faith and daily behavior.
  - Principle: Actions, driven by the heart's allegiance, reveal true
    discipleship (John 8:44, 47).
  - Bridge: How do our responses in traffic, at work, or online reflect God's
    character or the opposite?
  - Action Steps: 1. Daily examine one reaction/attitude against Christ's
    example (Phil 2:5). 2. Practice one specific act of benevolence/humility
    (Micah 6:8). 3. Consciously choose to speak truth in love (Eph 4:15).

### Conclusion: Honoring Christ & Appeal (John 8:48-49) (6 min)

- **The Accusation & The Reality:** They dishonored Jesus (v. 48-49a).
- **The Disciple's Aim:** Jesus honored His Father (v. 49b). True disciples seek
  to honor Jesus.
  - Honoring through adoration AND obedience (reflecting His character).
  - [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to
    demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a
    coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it
    to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that
    might otherwise remain closed.]
- **Summary:** True discipleship is marked by:
  - Continuance in His Word (v. 31)
  - Experiencing Freedom from Sin through Truth (v. 32, 36)
  - Reflecting God's Character in Action (v. 39, 47)
  - Honoring Christ (v. 49)
- **Final (RQ):** Are we content with the _name_ of disciple, or are we pursuing
  the _reality_ described by Jesus?
- **Invitation:** Commit today to _continue_ in His Word, embrace His _freedom_,
  cultivate His _character_, and _honor_ Him in all things. Choose to be a
  disciple _indeed_.
- Closing Prayer
