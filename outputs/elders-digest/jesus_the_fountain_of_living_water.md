-   [Whiteboard: Write Title & John 7:37-38]

### Section 1: The Problem - Spiritual Thirst (7 min)
-   **The Human Condition:** We were created for connection with God, but sin creates separation and spiritual emptiness.
    -   Jeremiah 2:13: God identifies the core problem – forsaking Him, the Fountain, for inadequate, man-made solutions ('broken cisterns').
    -   [Whiteboard: Draw simple diagram: God (Fountain) <- Human -> Broken Cisterns (Worldly Solutions)]
    -   **(RQ):** What are some 'broken cisterns' people try to draw satisfaction from today? (Based on Jer 2:13)
-   **Recognizing the Need:** True satisfaction begins with acknowledging our spiritual thirst and the inadequacy of worldly sources.
    -   This thirst is a sign of our need for God.

### Section 2: The Provision - Jesus, The Fountain (8 min)
-   **Jesus Offers the Solution:** He directly addresses this need.
    -   John 4:10: Jesus tells the Samaritan woman He could give her 'living water'.
    -   [Whiteboard: Write: Living Water = ?]
    -   **(RQ):** What was radical about Jesus offering this to *this* woman? (Context of John 4)
-   **The Nature of Living Water:**
    -   John 4:13-14: Unlike physical water, this water provides *lasting* satisfaction and eternal life. It becomes a 'well of water springing up'.
    -   This 'Living Water' represents the Holy Spirit, given through Christ. (Connect forward briefly to John 7:39).
    -   [Whiteboard: Living Water = Holy Spirit -> Eternal Life (John 4:14)]
-   [Aside: Like finding a pure spring in a desert, discovering Christ quenches a thirst we didn't even know how to name. Worldly 'drinks' only increase the craving.]

### Section 3: The Process - Coming and Drinking (Faith) (8 min) [*]
-   **The Divine Invitation:** Accessing this water requires a response to God's call.
    -   Isaiah 55:1: "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters... without money and without price." Emphasizes grace – it's a free gift, not earned.
    -   [Whiteboard: Invitation (Isa 55:1) -> COME]
    -   **(RQ):** Why is it significant that this water is offered 'without price'? (Based on Isa 55:1)
-   **The Steps to Receiving:** (Derived from John 7:37)
    1.  **Recognize Thirst:** Acknowledge spiritual need (If any man thirst...).
    2.  **Come to Jesus:** Approach Him personally, turning from other sources (...let him come unto me...).
    3.  **Drink (Receive by Faith):** Accept and appropriate His gift through belief and trust (...and drink. He that believeth on me...). Faith is the act of receiving.
    -   [Whiteboard: Steps: 1. Thirst (Need) 2. Come (Approach Jesus) 3. Drink (Receive by Faith - John 7:37)]
-   **Salvation by Grace through Faith:** Reinforce that this process is about receiving a gift, not achieving salvation through works (Eph 2:8-9 contextually relevant).

### Section 4: The Power & Promise - The Holy Spirit (7 min)
-   **The Identity of the Living Water:**
    -   John 7:39: Explicitly states the 'living water' represents the Holy Spirit, given after Jesus' glorification.
-   **The Spirit's Work:** The Holy Spirit is essential in the believer's life.
    -   Conviction of sin (John 16:8 - implied need for the water).
    -   Sealing: Assurance and guarantee of salvation.
        -   Ephesians 1:13-14: Believers are 'sealed with that holy Spirit of promise' as an 'earnest' (down payment) of our inheritance.
        -   [Whiteboard: Holy Spirit = Conviction + Seal (Eph 1:13-14) + Power]
    -   Empowerment for living and service.

### Section 5: The Purpose - Becoming a Channel (5 min)
-   **From Recipient to Source:** Receiving the Living Water isn't the end goal.
    -   John 7:38: "He that believeth on me... out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water."
    -   The indwelling Spirit transforms the believer into a source of blessing for others.
    -   [Whiteboard: Receive (John 7:37) -> Overflow (John 7:38)]
-   **Practical Outflow:**
    -   **(RQ):** How can these 'rivers' flow out of us practically during the week? (Based on John 7:38)
    -   Examples: Sharing testimony, acts of service, reflecting Christ's character, words of encouragement – all empowered by the Spirit.
    -   [Analogy (from John 7:38): We are not meant to be stagnant ponds, but flowing rivers carrying life to a dry world.]
-   [Aside: Instead of just consuming spiritual resources, receiving the Spirit compels us to share. It's like a wellspring – the more water flows out, the fresher the source remains.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
-   **Recap:**
    -   We all have a deep spiritual thirst only God can satisfy (Jer 2:13).
    -   Jesus is the Fountain of Living Water, offering the Holy Spirit (John 4:14, John 7:39).
    -   We receive this gift by recognizing our need, coming to Him, and drinking (believing/faith) (John 7:37).
    -   This gift is free by grace (Isa 55:1) and results in the Spirit's work (Eph 1:13-14).
    -   Receiving transforms us into channels of blessing (John 7:38).
-   **Final Invitation:** Reiterate Jesus' call from John 7:37: "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."
-   **Appeal:** Have you recognized your thirst? Have you come to the Fountain? Have you drunk deeply by faith? Encourage a personal response to come to Jesus today and receive the Living Water freely offered.
