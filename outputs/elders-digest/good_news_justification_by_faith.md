### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with a relatable scenario: receiving unexpected good news after
  anticipating bad news.
- Introduce the concept: The Bible presents both bad news and incredibly good
  news.
- State the goal: To understand the core message of the Gospel – the Good News
  found in Christ.
- Read Central Verse: Romans 3:24. [Write on board: Romans 3:24 - Justified
  Freely by Grace through Redemption]
- Why is this news so good? **(RQ)** Because it addresses our deepest problem.

### Section 1: The Universal Problem (The Bad News) (10 min)

- **Point 1: Everyone is Included.**
  - Scripture: Romans 3:23 ("For all have sinned...")
  - Explanation: Sin isn't just for 'bad' people; it's a universal human
    condition – falling short of God's perfect standard.
  - [Write on board: All Have Sinned (Rom 3:23) = Universal Condition]
  - How does recognizing this universality change how we see ourselves and
    others? **(RQ)**
- **Point 2: The Consequence of Sin.**
  - Scripture: Romans 6:23a ("For the wages of sin is death...")
  - Explanation: Sin earns a just consequence – separation from God, ultimately
    death.
  - [Write on board: Wages of Sin = Death (Rom 6:23a)]
  - This isn't arbitrary; it's the natural result of separation from the Source
    of Life.
- **Point 3: The Inability of Human Effort.**
  - Scripture: Romans 3:20 ("Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no
    flesh be justified...")
  - Explanation: Trying to earn righteousness through rule-keeping is
    impossible. The law reveals sin; it doesn't cure it.
  - [Whiteboard: Law -> Shows Sin (Rom 3:20), Doesn't Justify]
  - EGW Concept: Even our best efforts are tainted. (Ref: Concept from _Steps to
    Christ_ on self-centered motives polluting works).
  - Why is it vital to understand we cannot save ourselves? **(RQ)** It prepares
    us for the _real_ solution.

### Section 2: God's Amazing Solution (The Good News) [*] (15 min)

- **Point 1: Justification – A Divine Declaration.**
  - Scripture: Romans 3:24a ("Being justified...")
  - Explanation: Justification isn't _making_ us righteous intrinsically at
    first, but _declaring_ us righteous legally based on Christ.
  - [Write on board: Justified = Declared Righteous (Not earned)]
  - Analogy Concept: Like a judge declaring an indebted person's debt 'paid in
    full' by another.
- **Point 2: Freely – An Unearned Gift.**
  - Scripture: Romans 3:24b ("...freely...")
  - Explanation: This status is given without cost to us; it cannot be earned or
    deserved.
  - [Write on board: Freely = Gift (Not wages)]
  - If it's free, why do we often try to add our 'payment'? **(RQ)**
- **Point 3: By Grace – God's Initiative.**
  - Scripture: Romans 3:24c ("...by his grace..."); Ephesians 2:8a ("For by
    grace are ye saved...")
  - Explanation: Grace is God's unmerited favor _and_ His enabling power. He
    initiates salvation because He loves us.
  - [Write on board: Grace = Unmerited Favor + Divine Power (Eph 2:8)]
  - [Aside: Grace isn't just overlooking sin; it's God actively reaching down
    with the solution, providing the power to overcome, even when we were His
    enemies (Rom 5:10).]
- **Point 4: Through Faith – The Receiving Hand.**
  - Scripture: Ephesians 2:8b ("...through faith; and that not of yourselves: it
    is the gift of God...")
  - Explanation: Faith is the hand that receives God's free gift. It's trust in
    His promise and His Son.
  - EGW Concept: Faith itself is a gift, enabling us to grasp the promise. (Ref:
    Concept from _Steps to Christ_, p. 61 - Salvation is a free gift, received
    by faith).
  - [Whiteboard: Faith = Trusting & Receiving God's Gift (Eph 2:8)]
- **Point 5: Redemption – The Price Paid.**
  - Scripture: Romans 3:24d ("...through the redemption that is in Christ
    Jesus:")
  - Explanation: Redemption means being bought back from slavery (to sin). The
    price was Christ's infinite sacrifice.
  - [Write on board: Redemption = Bought Back by Christ's Sacrifice (Rom 3:24)]
  - EGW Concept: The infinite value of Christ's sacrifice met the infinite
    demands of the law. (Ref: Concept from _Desire of Ages_ on the cost of
    redemption).
  - How does understanding the _cost_ of redemption deepen our appreciation for
    grace? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: Receiving and Sharing the Gift (10 min)

- **Point 1: The Response to Grace.**
  - Scripture: Titus 3:5 ("Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
    according to his mercy he saved us...")
  - Explanation: True faith doesn't lead to complacency but to gratitude and
    transformation. Obedience flows _from_ salvation, not _for_ it.
  - [Whiteboard: Faith (Eph 2:8) -> Leads to -> Good Works (Eph 2:10), Not the
    other way around]
  - How does this understanding protect us from legalism and license? **(RQ)**
- **Point 2: The Certainty of the Gift.**
  - Scripture: Romans 6:23b ("...but the gift of God is eternal life through
    Jesus Christ our Lord.")
  - Explanation: Contrast the wages (death) with the gift (eternal life). It's
    secure in Christ.
  - [Aside: Sometimes we treat God's gift like a temporary loan we might default
    on. But Romans 6:23 calls it *eternal* life, secured by Jesus Himself. Our
    focus shifts from anxious effort to grateful trust.]
- **Point 3: The Mandate to Share.**
  - Explanation: Receiving such incredible news compels us to share it.
  - EGW Concept: Every true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a
    missionary. The obligation rests upon all to share the Savior's message.
    (Ref: Concept from EGW on mission, e.g., _Desire of Ages_, p. 195, or
    similar sentiments regarding the Great Commission).
  - [Write on board: Received Gift -> Share the Good News! (Matt 28:19-20)]
  - Connection to 3 Angels' Messages: This core gospel IS the everlasting gospel
    to be preached 'to all the world, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and
    people' (Rev 14:6).
  - **Actionable Steps (from text):** How can we practically share this Good
    News this week, flowing from the grace we've received?
    1.  **Pray:** Ask God this week for one specific opportunity to share the
        hope found in His free gift (Rom 3:24).
    2.  **Share a Verse:** Be ready to share Romans 6:23b ("...the gift of God
        is eternal life...") with someone who might be struggling or seeking.
    3.  **Live Grace:** Intentionally demonstrate unmerited kindness or
        forgiveness to someone, reflecting God's grace (Eph 2:8), and be
        prepared to explain _why_ (1 Peter 3:15).

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: We faced the bad news (sin, death, inability - Rom 3:23, 6:23a, 3:20).
  But God provided the Good News (justification, freely, by grace, through
  faith, via redemption - Rom 3:24, Eph 2:8).
- Reiterate: Salvation is a free gift. Don't try to earn what God freely offers.
- Invitation: Have you personally accepted this free gift? Are you resting in
  the finished work of Christ? **(RQ)**
- Final Charge: Let the reality of this Good News transform you and compel you
  to take simple steps, like those discussed, to share it with a world that
  desperately needs it.
- Prayer of Thanksgiving and Commitment.
