### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Beyond personal rest, what is God's _primary_ purpose for the
  Sabbath?
- **The Divine Appointment:** Sabbath as a specific time set aside by God for
  meeting with His people corporately.
- **Relevance Today:** In a busy, individualistic world, why is _congregational_
  Sabbath worship vital?
- **Overview:** Explore the biblical foundation, nature, and prophetic
  significance of Sabbath worship.
- [Write on board: Sabbath = Divine Appointment for Worship (Heb 10:25)]

### Section 1: Divine Origins & Example (10 min)

- **Created, Blessed, Sanctified:**
  - God's act at the close of creation week (Gen 2:1-3).
  - Not just rest, but _set apart_ for holy use from the beginning.
  - [Whiteboard: Gen 2:1-3 -> Created -> Blessed -> Sanctified (Holy Use)]
- **The Commandment:**
  - Remembering the Sabbath (Exod 20:8-11) - rooted in Creation.
  - A command to keep it _holy_ – distinct from other days.
  - **(RQ):** How does remembering _Creation_ inform _how_ we keep the Sabbath
    holy? (Ex 20:11)
- **Jesus, Our Example:**
  - His custom: Synagogue worship on Sabbath (Luke 4:16).
  - He didn't abolish it; He showed its true purpose (healing, mercy, worship).
  - [Write on board: Jesus' Custom (Luke 4:16) = Sabbath Worship]
- **The Apostles' Practice:**
  - Following Christ's example: Paul reasoning from Scriptures on Sabbath (Acts
    17:2).
  - Early church continued meeting on the day God sanctified.
  - [Whiteboard: Apostles' Practice (Acts 17:2) = Continued Sabbath Worship]

### Section 2: The Experience of Sabbath Worship [*] (12 min)

- **A Congregational Call:**
  - The importance of assembling together (Heb 10:25).
  - Strength, encouragement, corporate praise found in community.
  - **(RQ):** What unique blessings come from worshipping _together_ that we
    miss when alone? (cf. Matt 18:20)
- **Worship of the Whole Being:**
  - Not just attendance, but engagement: heart, mind, soul (Mark 12:30).
  - Attitudes of reverence, awe, and holiness (Ps 95:6, Hab 2:20).
  - [Whiteboard: Worship = Heart + Mind + Soul (Reverence)]
- **Rest and Drawing Near:**
  - Ceasing from our own works to enter God's rest (Heb 4:9-10).
  - Making the Sabbath a delight, honoring Him (Isa 58:13-14).
  - A time to specifically draw closer to God, free from worldly distractions.
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture, especially on
    His holy day.]
- **Obedience and Blessing:**
  - Keeping Sabbath is an act of loving obedience (John 14:15).
  - Promised blessings for those who honor God's Sabbath (Isa 56:2, 6-7).
  - [Write Question: How can we make Sabbath worship less of a duty and more of
    a delight? (Isa 58:13)]

### Section 3: Sabbath, Seal, and Prophetic Significance (12 min)

- **The Seal of the Living God:**
  - The Sabbath commandment uniquely identifies God: Name (LORD thy God), Title
    (Creator), Territory (Heaven and Earth) (Exod 20:11).
  - A sign of God's authority and creative power.
  - Ellen G. White insight: Sabbath as the Seal distinguishing God's people
    (Signs of the Times, Nov 1, 1899; cf. Great Controversy Ch. 38).
  - [Whiteboard: Seal = Name + Title + Territory (Ex 20:11) -> Sign of God's
    Authority]
- **Connection to the Three Angels' Messages:**
  - The first angel's call: "...worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the
    sea, and the fountains of waters." (Rev 14:7).
  - This directly points back to the language of the Sabbath commandment (Exod
    20:11).
  - True Sabbath observance is a direct response to the end-time call to worship
    the Creator.
  - **(RQ):** In a world worshipping the creature more than the Creator (Rom
    1:25), how does Sabbath worship become a powerful testimony?
  - [Draw Arrow: Worship Creator (Rev 14:7) <-> Sabbath Command (Ex 20:11)]
- **Eternal Worship:**
  - Sabbath worship is a foretaste of eternity.
  - The redeemed will worship God from Sabbath to Sabbath in the new earth (Isa
    66:22-23).
  - Our congregational worship now prepares us for that eternal gathering.
  - [Whiteboard: Earthly Sabbath Worship -> Eternal Sabbath Worship (Isa 66:23)]
  - [Aside: Instead of letting worldly pressures encroach on Sabbath, we can
    view it as reclaiming sacred time. It's like finding a precious jewel (the
    Sabbath hours) amidst common stones (the week's demands) – we guard it
    because it connects us directly to the eternal kingdom.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Sabbath is God's gift: established at Creation, commanded for
  remembrance, exemplified by Christ and apostles, vital for congregational
  worship, a sign of His authority (Seal), and a preparation for eternity.
- **The Need:** Forsaking assembly weakens faith and witness (Heb 10:25).
- **The Biblical Principle:** God calls us to gather weekly on His holy day for
  worship, rest, and fellowship.
- **Bridging to Practice:** How can we elevate our _congregational_ Sabbath
  experience this week?
  - [Analogy: Like tuning instruments before an orchestra plays, preparing our
    hearts *before* church enhances corporate worship.]
- **Actionable Steps (derived from texts):**
  1.  Prepare beforehand: Plan Friday to truly rest and focus on God Saturday
      (cf. Ex 16:23).
  2.  Attend expectantly: Come ready to meet God and encourage others (Heb
      10:24-25).
  3.  Participate reverently: Engage fully with prayer, song, and study (Ps
      95:6).
  - [Whiteboard: Actions: Prepare -> Attend Expectantly -> Participate
    Reverently]
- **Invitation:** Commit to making congregational Sabbath worship a priority, a
  delight, and a holy convocation, drawing nearer to God and each other as we
  anticipate His coming and eternal worship.
