### Introduction (5 min)

- **Greeting & Prayer**
- **The Universal Question:** What does it _really_ mean to have faith? Is it
  just believing something in your head? **(RQ)** Or does the Bible describe
  something more active?
- **Importance:** Scripture states faith is non-negotiable for pleasing God (Heb
  11:6) and receiving salvation (Rom 1:16).
- **Goal:** Today, we'll explore the Bible's definition of true, saving faith –
  what it is, and what it isn't, by looking directly at key scriptures.
- **Central Verse Introduction:** Hebrews 11:6 gives us a foundational
  definition.
  - `[Write on board: Hebrews 11:6]`

### Section 1: Faith's Essential Nature (Heb 11:6) (10 min)

- **Reading & Unpacking Hebrews 11:6:** "But without faith it is impossible to
  please him..."
  - **Point 1: Faith is Essential:** Not optional, but fundamental to a
    relationship with God (Heb 11:6a).
    - Why is faith the starting point? **(RQ)** Because God is unseen;
      relationship requires trust beyond sight. It's the foundational
      requirement for approaching Him.
  - `[Write on board: FAITH = ESSENTIAL (Heb 11:6)]`
- **Point 2: Two Core Components (from Heb 11:6b):**
  - **A. Belief THAT God Is:** Acknowledging His existence, His reality ("he
    that cometh to God must believe that he is...").
    - Is this enough? **(RQ)** James 2:19 notes even demons believe this much!
      The verse continues...
  - **B. Belief IN God as Rewarder (Action):** Trusting His character and
    promises enough to _diligently seek Him_ ("...and that he is a rewarder of
    them that diligently seek him.").
    - This implies action, pursuit, engagement based on belief. It's not passive
      assent.
    - `[Write on board: FAITH = 1. Believe HE IS + 2. Diligently SEEK HIM (Heb 11:6)]`
    - What does "diligently seek" look like? **(RQ)** It involves prayer, study,
      obedience – acting on the belief that He exists and responds.

### Section 2: Faith for Salvation & Justification (Romans 1 & 3) (12 min) [*]

- **Transition:** How does this essential faith connect to our salvation? Paul
  explains in Romans.
- **Point 1: Faith Accesses God's Power for Salvation (Rom 1:16):**
  - The Gospel is God's power for salvation "to everyone who believes" (Rom
    1:16).
  - Faith is the _condition_ or the _channel_ through which God's saving power
    operates in a life.
  - `[Write on board: Faith -> Access to God's Power (Rom 1:16)]`
- **Point 2: Faith Reveals God's Righteousness (Rom 1:17):**
  - In the Gospel, God's righteousness is revealed "from faith for faith" (Rom
    1:17).
  - It's not our righteousness, but His, received and lived out by faith.
- **Point 3: The Law Cannot Justify (Rom 3:20):**
  - "By the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight" (Rom
    3:20a).
  - The law's purpose is to reveal sin ("for by the law is the knowledge of
    sin" - Rom 3:20b), not to make us righteous.
  - `[Illustration: A mirror (the law) shows you the dirt on your face (sin), but it cannot wash your face clean (justify you). Only faith in Christ's cleansing can do that.]`
- **Point 4: Justification is By Faith Alone (Rom 3:28):**
  - "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds
    of the law" (Rom 3:28).
  - Justification = Being declared righteous by God, not based on our works, but
    based on Christ's work received through faith.
  - `[Write on board: Justification = Declared Righteous BY FAITH (Rom 3:28)]`
  - This is God's gracious gift, received through the channel of faith.

### Section 3: Faith That Works (James 2 & Gal 5:6) (12 min)

- **Transition:** If we are saved by faith _apart_ from works (Rom 3:28), does
  that mean works don't matter at all? **(RQ)** James addresses this directly.
- **Point 1: Faith Without Action is Dead (James 2:17, 26):**
  - "Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead" (James
    2:17).
  - "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead
    also" (James 2:26).
  - James isn't adding works _for_ justification, but showing that genuine,
    living faith _naturally produces_ works as evidence.
  - `[Write on board: Faith (Spirit) + Works (Body) = Living Faith (James 2:26)]`
- **Point 2: Works Demonstrate Faith (James 2:18):**
  - Someone might say, "You have faith, and I have works." James replies, "Show
    me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works"
    (James 2:18).
  - Works are the visible evidence, the fruit, of an invisible, internal faith.
  - `[Aside: James isn't contradicting Paul (Romans 3:28). Paul speaks of works *of the law* done to *earn* salvation before justification. James speaks of works *of faith* that *demonstrate* salvation already received through faith. Both agree true faith transforms behavior.]`
- **Point 3: The Nature of Faith's Works: Love (Gal 5:6):**
  - What kind of "works" demonstrate true faith? Paul clarifies: "For in Christ
    Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith
    working through love" (Gal 5:6).
  - The works that evidence true faith are motivated by love for God and others,
    not by legalistic obligation or attempts to earn favor.
  - `[Illustration: A healthy apple tree (living faith) naturally produces apples (good works/love). It doesn't strain to tape apples onto its branches to prove it's an apple tree. The fruit is the natural result of its life.]`
  - `[Write on board: True Faith -> Works THROUGH LOVE (Gal 5:6)]`

### Conclusion & Application (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen from Scripture that true faith is essential (Heb
  11:6), it's the channel for justification (Rom 3:28), and it's a living,
  active principle that naturally produces works of love (James 2:17, Gal 5:6).
  It's not just believing _that_ God is, but actively _seeking_ Him because we
  trust Him.
- **Need/Question (from text):** The Bible challenges us: Is my faith merely
  mental agreement, or is it alive and active? (James 2:17). How does this
  understanding of active faith apply to _my_ life today?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** True, saving faith is not passive assent
  but an active trust in God (belief + diligent seeking - Heb 11:6) that
  receives justification (Rom 3:28) and results in a transformed life
  demonstrated by works motivated by love (James 2:26, Gal 5:6).
- **Bridging (from text):** Just as Abraham's faith was validated by his
  willingness to act (James 2:21-23), our faith finds its genuine expression
  when our belief in God's promises leads us to obey His Word and serve others
  in love (Gal 5:6). It connects head-belief to heart-trust and hand-action.
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  1.  **Reflect & Seek:** Where does my belief need more "diligent seeking" this
      week? Pick one specific way to actively seek God based on your trust in
      Him (Heb 11:6).
  2.  **Love in Action:** Ask God to show you one opportunity today or tomorrow
      where your faith can "work through love" towards someone (Gal 5:6).
  3.  **Self-Exam:** Honestly ask: Do my actions generally align with what I say
      I believe? (James 2:18). Where is there a disconnect?
- **Invitation:** True faith is a gift, but it's a gift that lives and breathes
  and acts. Let's pray for God to deepen our faith, moving it beyond mere belief
  _about_ Him to active trust _in_ Him – a faith that pleases Him (Heb 11:6) and
  changes us from the inside out.
- **Closing Prayer**
