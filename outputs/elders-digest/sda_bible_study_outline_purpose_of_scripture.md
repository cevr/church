### Section 2: Scripture Redeems & Reinforces [*] (15 min)
#### A. The Way of Salvation
-   Scripture clearly points to the **only way**: Jesus Christ (John 14:6).

-   [Whiteboard: The Way = JESUS (John 14:6; John 3:16)]

#### C. Standards & Commands
-   God's commands are expressions of His character and love, designed for our good (Deut 6:24).

-   **(RQ)** How does viewing God's law through the lens of John 14:15 change our perspective on obedience?

-   **Lamp/Light** (Psalm 119:105): Guides our path in darkness. [Whiteboard: Lamp (Ps 119:105) -> Guides]
-   **Sword** (Hebrews 4:12; Ephesians 6:17): Discerner of thoughts/intentions; offensive/defensive spiritual weapon. [Whiteboard: Sword (Heb 4:12) -> Discerns/Defends]

-   **(RQ)** Which function of Scripture (Mirror, Lamp, Food, etc.) do you need most in your life right now?
-   [Aside: "Just as physical food builds our bodies, the Word builds our spiritual 'muscles'. Neglecting it leads to weakness, making us unable to stand firm or complete the work God has for us (2 Tim 3:17). Consistent intake equips us for every good work He calls us to."]

### Conclusion & Application (5 min)
-   **Summary:** The Bible is God's inspired revelation (2 Tim 3:16). It shows us God, our need (Rom 3:23), the path to salvation through Christ (John 3:16), and serves to equip and mature believers for a life of purpose and service (2 Tim 3:17). It's living and active (Heb 4:12).
-   **Need/Question (from text):** Knowing the power and purpose of Scripture, how do we move from simply knowing *about* it to letting it actively transform us? (Reflects James 1:22 - be doers).
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** God's Word is designed to be applied, leading to righteousness and equipping us for good works (2 Tim 3:16-17). It requires us not just to hear, but to *do* (James 1:23-25).
-   **Bridging (from text):** Just as a mirror requires action after seeing a flaw (James 1:24), or food requires eating to give strength (Matt 4:4), Scripture requires our engagement and obedience to fulfill its purpose in our daily lives.
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):** Choose one this week:
    1.  **Mirror Check (James 1:23-25):** Look into God's Word daily. Identify *one specific area* where Scripture shows you need change, and pray specifically for God's help to act on it.
    2.  **Good Works Prep (2 Tim 3:17):** Think of *one specific 'good work'* (an act of service, kindness, witness, or obedience) God might be calling you to. Find a scripture that instructs or encourages you for *that specific work* and meditate on it.
    3.  **Sword Practice (Heb 4:12):** When facing a decision or a tempting thought this week, consciously pause and ask, "What does God's Word say?" Use a specific verse as your guide or defense.
-   **Invitation:** Will you commit this week to not just reading, but *responding* to God's Word? Ask the Holy Spirit (John 16:13) to illuminate its truths and empower you to live them out. Let it be your mirror, lamp, sword, and food, thoroughly furnishing you for His purpose.
