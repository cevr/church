### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- The Universal Experience: Questions and uncertainties arise even for
  believers.
- Misconception: Is having _any_ doubt a sign of weak or absent faith? **(RQ)**
- Goal: To understand doubt biblically, distinguish it from unbelief, and learn
  how God meets us in our questions.
- Introduce Central Verse: Mark 9:24 - The honest cry of a struggling heart.
  `[Whiteboard: Write Mark 9:24 - "Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief."]`

### Section 1: Defining Doubt vs. Unbelief (10 min)

- **Distinguishing Terms:** Crucial difference often missed.
  `[Whiteboard: Column 1: DOUBT (Inner Uncertainty) | Column 2: UNBELIEF (Willful Refusal)]`
- **Doubt (Pisteuo/Diakrino/Distazo):**
  - Inner uncertainty, questioning, wavering (James 1:6).
  - Often arises from circumstances, lack of understanding, or emotional
    distress (Psalm 77:1-9).
  - Can coexist with genuine faith (Mark 9:24).
  - Not necessarily sinful in itself; it's the _response_ that matters.
- **Unbelief (Apistia/Apeitheo):**
  - A settled refusal to trust God or His Word (Hebrews 3:12).
  - Often rooted in pride, rebellion, or love of sin.
  - Leads to departure from God (Hebrews 3:12).
    `[Whiteboard: Under UNBELIEF: -> Hebrews 3:12 - "departing from the living God"]`
- Why the distinction matters: Condemning honest questions pushes people away;
  recognizing willful rejection calls for repentance. **(RQ)**

### Section 2: God's Compassionate Response to Doubt [*] (12 min)

- God isn't afraid of our questions when brought honestly.
- **Example 1: John the Baptist (Matthew 11:2-6)**
  - Context: Imprisoned, facing death, expectations perhaps unmet.
  - His Question: "Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?"
    (v. 3)
  - Jesus' Response: Not rebuke, but _evidence_ (v. 4-5) - pointing to fulfilled
    prophecy and His works.
    `[Whiteboard: John the Baptist -> Jesus' Answer = EVIDENCE (Works/Prophecy)]`
  - Gentle encouragement: "Blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in
    me." (v. 6)
- **Example 2: Thomas (John 20:24-29)**
  - His Demand: Needed physical proof (v. 25).
  - Jesus' Response: Provided the evidence Thomas sought (v. 27).
    `[Whiteboard: Thomas -> Jesus' Answer = EVIDENCE (Wounds)]`
  - Call to higher faith: "be not faithless, but believing." (v. 27) & Blessing
    on future believers (v. 29).
- **Example 3: Asaph (Psalm 77)**
  - Deep distress, questioning God's goodness (v. 7-9).
  - His Turning Point: Remembering God's past faithfulness and mighty works (v.
    10-12). `[Whiteboard: Asaph -> Answer = REMEMBRANCE (God's Past Acts)]`
- **Key Takeaway:** Jesus meets honest doubt with compassion, evidence, and a
  call to deeper trust. He understands our frame (Psalm 103:14).
- `[Aside: Like a patient teacher, God doesn't dismiss the student struggling with a concept. He offers clearer explanations and points back to the foundational principles, inviting understanding rather than demanding blind acceptance.]`

### Section 3: Navigating Doubt Practically (12 min)

- Doubt doesn't have to be the end of faith; it can be a catalyst for growth.
- **Biblical Strategies:**
  1.  **Admit It Honestly (Mark 9:24; Psalm 77:1-3):**
      - Don't pretend or suppress. Voice your struggle to God.
      - He can handle your questions and pain.
  2.  **Seek God & Wisdom (James 1:5-6):**
      - Ask specifically for wisdom and clarity.
      - Crucial caveat: Ask _in faith_, expecting God to answer, not wavering
        between belief and unbelief.
        `[Whiteboard: James 1:5-6 - Ask God -> In Faith (Not Wavering)]`
  3.  **Seek Godly Counsel & Community (Proverbs 11:14; Galatians 6:1-2):**
      - Talk to mature believers who can offer support and perspective.
      - Avoid isolation, which can amplify doubt.
  4.  **Act on the Faith You Have (Mark 9:24):**
      - Like the father, acknowledge belief _alongside_ the struggle.
      - Continue practicing spiritual disciplines (prayer, study, fellowship)
        even when feelings waver.
        `[Analogy (from Mark 9:24): Like walking in fog – you can't see far, but you keep putting one foot in front of the other on the path you know.]`
  5.  **Doubt Your Doubts (2 Corinthians 10:5):**
      - Question the validity of the doubts themselves. Are they based on
        emotion, misunderstanding, or external pressures? **(RQ)**
      - Challenge negative thoughts with God's promises.
  6.  **Return to Foundational Truths (Psalm 77:11-12; Hebrews 12:1-2):**
      - Focus on core certainties: God's character (love, faithfulness), the
        cross, the resurrection, fulfilled prophecy.
        `[Whiteboard: Foundations: God's Character, Cross, Resurrection, Prophecy]`
      - Look to Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith.
- `[Aside: Sometimes our doubts feel like solid walls, but often they are more like smoke – intimidating but lacking substance when examined against the solid reality of God's revealed truth and historical faithfulness.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Doubt (uncertainty) is different from unbelief (refusal). God meets
  honest doubt with compassion and evidence.
- Struggling with God can be a sign of _engaged_ faith (like Jacob wrestling -
  Gen 32).
- We have practical, biblical ways to navigate seasons of questioning.
- The goal isn't a life without _any_ questions, but a faith anchored firmly in
  the trustworthiness of God and His Word, even amidst them.
- Invitation: If you're struggling with doubt, don't turn away. Turn _towards_
  God with honesty (Mark 9:24). Seek Him, review the evidence He has given
  (Scripture, His works), and trust Him to guide you.
- Final Encouragement: He who began a good work in you will complete it
  (Philippians 1:6). Trust His process.
- Closing Prayer
