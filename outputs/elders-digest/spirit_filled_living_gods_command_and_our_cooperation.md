### Introduction: The Need for Divine Power (6 min)

- Context: Ephesians 5 - Call to walk differently from the world (Eph 5:1-17).
  - Walk in love (v. 2), light (v. 8), wisdom (v. 15).
  - Urgency: Redeeming the time, days are evil (v. 16).
  - Need to understand God's will (v. 17).
- The World's Counterfeit: Offers temporary escapes, false 'fillings'.
- The Christian's Need: Divine power for this distinct walk. **(RQ)** Can we
  live this way on our own strength?
- Introduce the Central Verse: Paul's pivotal command in Eph 5:18.
  `[Write on board: Ephesians 5:18]`

### Section 1: The Contrast and Command (8 min)

- **The Negative Command: "Be not drunk with wine..."** (Eph 5:18a)
  - Wine represents worldly influence, seeking satisfaction/escape apart from
    God.
  - Leads to "excess" (Greek: _asotia_ - debauchery, profligacy, wastefulness).
    Loss of control, judgment impaired. (Prov 20:1, 23:29-35).
    `[Whiteboard: Wine = Worldly Control -> Excess (Loss of Self-Control)]`
  - **(RQ)** Why does Paul use this specific contrast? What other 'wines' does
    the world offer today that lead to spiritual 'drunkenness' and excess?
- **The Positive Command: "...but be filled with the Spirit."** (Eph 5:18b)
  - This is not a suggestion, but an imperative – a divine command for _every_
    believer.
  - Implies a different kind of influence, a divine control.
    `[Whiteboard: Spirit = Divine Influence -> Godly Self-Control (Gal 5:23)]`
  - The core need for living the Christian life described in Ephesians.

### Section 2: The Nature of Being Filled [*] (10 min)

- Unpacking "Be Filled" (Greek: _plerousthe_):
  - **Continuous Action:** Present tense, imperative mood. Not a one-time event,
    but a constant state to be maintained. "Be continually filled."
    `[Whiteboard: "Be Filled" (Eph 5:18) = Continuous Action]`
    - **(RQ)** How does viewing this as an ongoing need change our daily
      perspective?
  - **Passive Voice:** We don't fill ourselves; we allow God the Holy Spirit to
    fill us. `[Whiteboard: Passive Voice = God Acts, We Receive/Allow]`
    - It's His work _in_ us, not primarily our work _for_ Him.
  - **Requires Yielding:** The passive voice implies our cooperation through
    surrender.
    - We must yield control to the Spirit's influence. (Rom 6:13, 12:1-2).
    - `[Analogy: Spirit like wind, we are the sail - must be yielded, unfurled to catch the wind]`
    - This is 'control by consent'.
      `[Write on board: Yielding = Control by Consent]`
    - `[Aside: Yielding isn't losing personality, but aligning it with God's purpose. Like a skilled musician playing an instrument – the instrument fulfills its potential under the master's hand.]`

### Section 3: The Results of Being Filled (8 min)

- These are the _evidences_ or _outcomes_ of being Spirit-filled, not the means
  to become filled (Eph 5:19-21).
  - **Joyful Worship & Fellowship (v. 19):**
    - Speaking to one another (psalms, hymns, spiritual songs).
    - Singing and making melody _in your heart_ to the Lord.
    - Internal reality overflowing into communal and personal praise.
      `[Whiteboard: Result 1: Joyful Worship (v.19) - Heart & Community]`
  - **Constant Thanksgiving (v. 20):**
    - Giving thanks _always_ for _all things_ to God the Father in Christ's
      name.
    - Spirit-filled perspective sees God's hand even in trials. (1 Thess 5:18).
      `[Whiteboard: Result 2: Thanksgiving (v.20) - Always, All Things]`
    - **(RQ)** How does the Spirit enable thankfulness in difficult
      circumstances?
  - **Mutual Submission (v. 21):**
    - Submitting to one another in the fear (reverence) of God.
    - Humility, respect, putting others first. Foundation for godly
      relationships (flows into instructions for wives, husbands, children,
      servants in Eph 5:22-6:9).
      `[Whiteboard: Result 3: Mutual Submission (v.21) - Reverence for God -> Humility]`
      (Phil 2:3-5).

### Section 4: Cooperating with the Spirit (8 min)

- Being filled (passive) requires our active cooperation.
  - **Walk by the Spirit (Gal 5:16):** Make moment-by-moment choices aligned
    with His leading. This overcomes the flesh.
  - **Live by the Spirit (Gal 5:25):** If the Spirit gives us life, let Him
    direct our steps.
    `[Whiteboard: Cooperate: Walk (Gal 5:16), Live (Gal 5:25)]`
  - **Do Not Quench the Spirit (1 Thess 5:19):** Avoid resisting, ignoring, or
    suppressing His work (conviction, guidance, gifts).
    `[Whiteboard: Don't Quench! (1 Thess 5:19)]`
    - **(RQ)** What common attitudes or actions might 'quench' the Spirit's work
      in us? (cf. Eph 4:30 - Grieve not the Spirit).
  - **Be Led by the Spirit (Rom 8:14):** This is the mark of God's children.
    Requires listening and obeying His promptings through Word and conscience.
    `[Whiteboard: Be Led (Rom 8:14)]`
    - `[Aside: Think of the Spirit's guidance like GPS. It gives directions, but we still have to drive the car, make the turns, and avoid ignoring the prompts if we want to reach the destination God intends.]`
  - Cooperation involves: Prayer (asking - Luke 11:13), Bible study (knowing His
    will), Obedience (acting on His leading), Yielding (surrendering our will).

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: The command is clear (Eph 5:18) - reject worldly intoxication, embrace
  divine filling.
- Nature: It's God's continuous work as we yield control.
- Results: Transformed worship, pervasive thankfulness, humble relationships.
- Our Part: Active cooperation - walking, living, not quenching, being led.
- **(RQ)** Are we seeking daily to be filled, yielded to His control?
- This isn't optional for effective Christian living; it's essential for
  personal victory, church health, and world impact.
- Appeal: Choose today, and every day, to consciously yield to the Holy Spirit.
  Ask the Father for this promised gift (Luke 11:13). Commit to cooperating with
  His work in your life.
