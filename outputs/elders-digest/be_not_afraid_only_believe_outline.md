### Introduction (5 min)

*   **Hook:** Begin with the story of Jairus (Mark 5:21-23) - a man of position facing a crisis beyond his control.
*   Introduce the parallel story: the woman suffering for 12 years (Mark 5:25-26).
*   **Theme:** Life brings crises that overwhelm our best human efforts (wealth, status, connections, even religious standing).
*   **Central Question:** Where do we turn when human resources fail? **(RQ)**
*   [Whiteboard: Write Title & Central Verse: Mark 5:36]

### Section 1: The Limits of Human Resources (10 min)

*   **Point:** Human resources are ultimately powerless against life's greatest crises (sickness, death).
    *   Jairus: Ruler of the synagogue, likely influential and respected, yet helpless before his daughter's impending death (Mark 5:22-23).
    *   Woman: Spent all her living on physicians, only grew worse (Mark 5:26). Wealth and medical expertise failed.
    *   [Whiteboard: Human Limits: Position (Jairus), Wealth (Woman), Expertise (Physicians) vs. Sickness/Death - *Cite Mark 5:23, 26*]
*   **Point:** Tragedy and trials are universal; they don't discriminate.
    *   Scripture confirms this: "Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble." (Job 14:1)
    *   Jesus Himself warned: "In the world ye shall have tribulation..." (John 16:33a)
    *   (RQ) Why is it important to recognize that status or piety doesn't grant immunity from trials, according to these verses?
*   **Transition:** When human help fails and trials are inevitable, what is the *necessary* resource?

### Section 2: Faith Reaching for the Divine [*] (10 min)

*   **Point:** Faith in Jesus Christ and His power *alone* is the necessary resource.
    *   The woman's realization: If only she could touch His clothes (Mark 5:27-28). Her focus shifted from human means to divine power.
    *   [Whiteboard: Draw arrow: Human Failure -> Faith -> Jesus - *Cite Mark 5:28*]
*   **Point:** Even small or imperfect faith, directed toward Jesus, is acknowledged.
    *   Her faith was perhaps mixed with superstition (touching garment), yet it was directed *toward Jesus*.
    *   Jesus recognized the touch of faith amidst the crowd (Mark 5:30-32).
    *   He commended her: "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole..." (Mark 5:34).
    *   (RQ) How does Jesus' response to the woman encourage those who feel their faith is weak or imperfect (Mark 5:34)?
*   [Aside: Like finding a single lifeline in a storm, even a trembling hand reaching for Christ connects us to infinite strength. He doesn't measure the perfection of our grasp, but the sincerity of our reach towards Him.]
*   **Transition:** This encounter demonstrates Jesus' power over chronic illness. But what about the ultimate crisis Jairus faced?

### Section 3: When Hope Seems Lost - The Test of Faith (10 min)

*   **Point:** God's timing may involve delays that test faith; trust is required even when circumstances worsen.
    *   Jesus is delayed helping Jairus by the encounter with the woman.
    *   The devastating news arrives: "Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?" (Mark 5:35).
    *   From Jairus' perspective: the delay seemed fatal. Hope appeared lost.
    *   [Whiteboard: Delay (Mark 5:24, 30-34) -> Bad News (Mark 5:35) = Test of Faith]
    *   (RQ) How might Jairus have felt hearing this news while Jesus was seemingly occupied elsewhere (Mark 5:35)? How do we react when God seems slow to answer?
*   **Point:** Jesus has authority over sickness *and* death.
    *   The messengers saw death as final, the end of the need for Jesus' help (Mark 5:35).
    *   Jesus immediately counters their human perspective.
*   [Illustration Concept (from Mark 5:35-36): Like a doctor being told surgery is pointless because the patient just died, but the Master Surgeon knows He can still operate beyond death itself.]
*   **Transition:** In the face of utter hopelessness, what is Jesus' instruction?

### Section 4: The Command That Conquers Fear (5 min)

*   **Point:** Jesus' command, 'Be not afraid, only believe,' is the key to overcoming fear in hopeless situations.
    *   Jesus overrides the message of despair with a command of faith (Mark 5:36).
    *   He dismisses the mourners (unbelief/doubt) (Mark 5:38-40).
    *   [Whiteboard: Write Large: "BE NOT AFRAID, ONLY BELIEVE" - Mark 5:36]
*   **Point:** No situation is beyond Christ's power and ability.
    *   He takes the child by the hand: "Talitha cumi" (Damsel, I say unto thee, arise) (Mark 5:41).
    *   Immediate restoration to life (Mark 5:42).
    *   Demonstrates His absolute authority over death itself.
    *   (RQ) What does Jesus' action in Mark 5:41-42 declare about His identity and power?

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

*   **Recap:**
    *   We all face trials where human resources fail (Job 14:1, Mark 5:23, 26).
    *   Jesus is the *only* sufficient resource (Mark 5:28).
    *   He honors even imperfect faith directed toward Him (Mark 5:34).
    *   Delays and worsening circumstances test our faith, requiring trust (Mark 5:35).
    *   His command cuts through fear: "Be not afraid, only believe" (Mark 5:36).
    *   He holds ultimate power over sickness and death (Mark 5:41-42).
*   **Application:** Trusting Jesus and bringing our 'impossible' situations (fears, anxieties, 'dead' hopes) to Him is the path to experiencing His power.
    *   **Need:** Fear paralyzes, despair crushes.
    *   **Principle:** Faith in Christ's word and power overcomes fear (Mark 5:36).
    *   **Action Steps (from Mark 5):** 
        1.  Acknowledge your need/limitations (like Jairus/woman).
        2.  Actively turn *to* Jesus, even with trembling faith (like the woman).
        3.  Choose to obey His command: "Only believe," even when circumstances scream otherwise (like Jairus needed to).
    *   [Whiteboard: Action: 1. Acknowledge Need 2. Turn to Jesus (Mark 5:28) 3. Choose Belief (Mark 5:36)]
*   **Invitation:** What 'dead' situation or overwhelming fear are you facing? Will you heed Jesus' command today: "Be not afraid, only believe"? Bring it to Him now in trust.
*   Final thought: He who conquered death for Jairus' daughter conquered it for us all at Calvary, offering eternal life to those who believe (John 16:33b).
