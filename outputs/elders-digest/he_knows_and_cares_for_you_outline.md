### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a common feeling: Do I matter? Does anyone truly know or
  care about my struggles?
- Introduce the comforting truth: God's knowledge isn't just general; it's
  deeply personal and caring.
- State the study's purpose: To explore the biblical basis for trusting God's
  specific care and plan for _you_.
- Introduce Central Verse: Jeremiah 29:11
  - [Write on board: Jer 29:11 - God's Thoughts = Peace, Hope, Future]
- Brief overview of topics: God's knowledge, His care in trials, His presence,
  His faithfulness, and our response of trust.

### Main Content 1: God Knows You Intimately (10 min)

- **Foundation:** God's care begins with His perfect knowledge.
- **Explore Psalm 139:1-4:**
  - "O Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me... Thou understandest my
    thought afar off... art acquainted with all my ways... there is not a word
    in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether."
  - [Whiteboard: Ps 139 - Searched, Known, Understood Thoughts, Acquainted Ways,
    Known Words]
  - Emphasis: Not just actions, but thoughts, motives, unspoken words.
  - **(RQ):** How does knowing God knows _everything_ about us change how we see
    ourselves and approach Him? (Not in fear, but in awe of His attention).
- **Explore Matthew 10:29-31:**
  - "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on
    the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all
    numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows."
  - [Whiteboard: Matt 10:29-31 - Sparrows Noticed -> Hairs Numbered -> YOU =
    More Value]
  - Emphasis: God's awareness extends to the smallest details; human value is
    paramount.
  - **(RQ):** If God cares about sparrows and hair counts, how much more does He
    care about your deepest needs and anxieties?
- **Connection:** This intimate knowledge isn't for judgment alone, but forms
  the basis of His personal care.

### Main Content 2: God's Sovereign Care & Constant Presence [*] (12 min)

- **Foundation:** God's knowledge translates into active, providential care,
  even when circumstances seem chaotic.
- **Explore Romans 8:28:**
  - "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God,
    to them who are the called according to his purpose."
  - [Whiteboard: Rom 8:28 - ALL Things -> Work Together -> GOOD (for those
    loving/called by God)]
  - Emphasis: Not that all things _are_ good, but God _works_ them for ultimate
    good according to His purpose.
  - [Brief Concept: God as the Master Weaver - uses dark threads (trials) along
    with light threads to create a beautiful tapestry (His purpose)].
  - **(RQ):** Can we trust God's purpose even when we don't understand the
    immediate 'why' behind our trials, based on this promise?
- **Explore Hebrews 13:5 & Matthew 28:20:**
  - Heb 13:5: "...for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."
  - Matt 28:20: "...lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.
    Amen."
  - [Whiteboard: Heb 13:5 / Matt 28:20 = God's Unfailing Presence]
  - Emphasis: His care isn't distant; His presence is constant, a source of
    strength.
  - **(RQ):** How does remembering God's constant presence change how we face
    loneliness or difficult situations?
- **God's Past Actions Demonstrate Care:**
  - Reference Rev 13:8 ("Lamb slain from the foundation of the world").
  - God's plan for salvation, conceived before creation, shows His ultimate care
    and commitment.
  - [Aside: God's plan wasn't a reaction to sin; it was a proactive provision
    rooted in His eternal love. He knew the cost and chose to pay it for us,
    demonstrating the depth of His care long before we existed.]

### Main Content 3: Trusting His Plan & Grace (12 min)

- **Foundation:** Understanding God's knowledge, care, and presence leads to the
  response of trust, especially regarding His future plans and provision of
  grace.
- **Revisit Jeremiah 29:11:**
  - "...to give you an expected end." (KJV) / "...a future and a hope."
    (NIV/ESV)
  - [Whiteboard: Jer 29:11 -> Expected End = Hopeful Future]
  - Emphasis: God's plans are ultimately for our peace and restoration, even if
    the path involves difficulty (context of Jeremiah - exile).
  - **(RQ):** How does focusing on God's promised 'expected end' help us
    navigate present uncertainties?
- **Explore 2 Corinthians 12:9:**
  - "And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is
    made perfect in weakness..."
  - [Whiteboard: 2 Cor 12:9 - My Grace = Sufficient; My Strength -> Perfected in
    Weakness]
  - Emphasis: God doesn't always remove the trial, but provides sufficient grace
    _within_ it. Our weakness becomes the arena for His power.
  - **(RQ):** Instead of asking God only to remove the problem, how can we ask
    for His sufficient grace _in_ the problem, based on this verse?
- **Trust Demonstrated through Surrender (Romans 12:1-2):**
  - "...present your bodies a living sacrifice... be not conformed to this
    world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove
    what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
  - [Whiteboard: Rom 12:1-2 -> Living Sacrifice + Renewed Mind = Proving God's
    Good Will]
  - Emphasis: Trust involves yielding our will, allowing God to transform us
    through trials, aligning us with His perfect plan.
  - This process develops character fit for His kingdom.
  - [Aside: Trusting God through trials is like spiritual strength training.
    It's uncomfortable, but it builds the 'muscles' of faith and resilience
    needed to reflect His character more fully.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap Key Truths:**
  - God knows you intimately (Ps 139, Matt 10).
  - He cares sovereignly and is always present (Rom 8:28, Heb 13:5).
  - He has faithful plans for your future (Jer 29:11).
  - His grace is sufficient in every trial (2 Cor 12:9).
- **Practical Takeaway:** The challenge isn't _if_ God knows and cares, but
  whether we will _trust_ His knowledge and care, especially when life is hard.
  - [Whiteboard Question: Will I trust His thoughts (Jer 29:11) over my fears?]
- **Actionable Steps (derived from texts):**
  1.  **Acknowledge His Knowledge:** Daily remind yourself (perhaps using
      Ps 139) that God sees and understands your situation.
  2.  **Look for His Hand:** Actively seek how God might be working things for
      good (Rom 8:28), even in difficulty.
  3.  **Rely on His Grace:** When feeling weak, consciously ask for His
      sufficient grace (2 Cor 12:9) instead of just focusing on the problem.
  4.  **Choose Trust:** Make a conscious decision to trust His plan (Jer 29:11)
      and surrender your will (Rom 12:1-2).
- **Final Appeal:** Rest in the assurance of Jeremiah 29:11. God's thoughts
  toward you are peace. Trust Him. He knows you, He cares for you, and He has a
  hopeful future planned.
- **Closing Prayer:** Focus on gratitude for God's personal knowledge and care,
  asking for strength to trust His plan and rely on His grace daily.
