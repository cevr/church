### Introduction (6 min)

- **Hook:** The universal tension: What _I_ want vs. what _God_ asks. We all
  face moments where God's will seems difficult or undesirable.
- Introduce Jonah: A dramatic, real-life case study in resisting vs. yielding to
  God's specific command (Jonah 1:1-3).
- **Affirm Biblical Historicity:**
  - The Bible, including narratives like Jonah, is God's inspired Word and
    historically accurate (2 Timothy 3:16).
  - Jesus Himself affirmed Jonah's experience as real history, using it as a
    sign (Matthew 12:40-41).
  - `[Write on board: Bible = TRUE History (Matt 12:40-41)]`
- **(RQ)** If Jesus treated Jonah as fact, shouldn't we take its lessons
  seriously?
- **Central Theme:** Exploring the critical importance and profound blessing of
  yielding our will to God's revealed Word, as highlighted by our Central Verse
  (Luke 8:21).

### Main Content Section 1: The Reality of God's Word & Cost of Resistance (10 min)

- **God's Specific Call:** Jonah 1:1-2 - "Now the word of the LORD came unto
  Jonah... saying, Arise, go to Nineveh..."
  - God's commands are clear and direct. He doesn't usually leave us guessing
    about His fundamental will.
  - The call involved leaving comfort and going to a place Jonah likely despised
    (Nineveh, capital of Assyria, Israel's enemy).
- **Jonah's Deliberate Disobedience:** Jonah 1:3 - "But Jonah rose up to flee
  unto Tarshish _from the presence of the LORD_..."
  - He didn't just hesitate; he actively ran in the opposite direction (Tarshish
    likely Spain, Nineveh east in Assyria).
  - He sought to escape God's presence – a futile attempt (Psalm 139:7-10).
  - `[Write on board: God's Call (Nineveh) <--> Jonah's Flight (Tarshish) (Jonah 1:1-3)]`
- **The Inevitable Cost:** Jonah 1:4-17 (Summarize briefly)
  - Disobedience brings turmoil – not just to the individual, but often
    impacting others (the storm, the sailors).
  - Running from God leads to loss (fare paid, dignity lost, ultimately thrown
    overboard).
  - **(RQ)** Can we truly run from God or the consequences of ignoring His Word?
    (Galatians 6:7)
- `[Aside: The sailors' fear of God contrasts sharply with Jonah's initial rebellion. Sometimes unbelievers show more reverence than God's own people! (Jonah 1:5, 16)]`

### Main Content Section 2: The Nature and Blessing of Yielding (12 min) [*]

- **Beyond Hearing: The Call to Action:** James 1:22 - "But be ye _doers_ of the
  word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves."
  - True faith isn't passive listening; it's active obedience. Hearing without
    doing is self-deception.
  - Our Central Verse echoes this: True relationship is defined by hearing _and_
    doing (Luke 8:21).
  - `[Write on board: Hear + DO = True Faith (James 1:22, Luke 8:21)]`
- **The Blessing of Doing:** James 1:25 - "But whoso looketh into the perfect
  law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
  _doer of the work_, this man shall be blessed in his deed."
  - Obedience isn't burdensome restriction; it's walking in God's "perfect law
    of liberty."
  - The blessing is _in the doing_ – experiencing God's presence and purpose.
- **God's Formula for True Success:** Joshua 1:8 - "This book of the law shall
  not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night,
  that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
  then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good
  success."
  - Success in God's eyes comes from internalizing His Word (meditate) and
    externalizing it (observe to do).
  - **(RQ)** Are we seeking worldly success formulas or God's guaranteed path
    through obedience?
- **Brief Illustration:** Building a life on God's Word is like the wise man
  building on the rock (Matthew 7:24-27). Hearing is knowing the blueprint;
  doing is actually _building_ according to it, ensuring stability when storms
  come. Resistance is building on sand.

### Main Content Section 3: God's Purpose: Restoration and Mission (11 min)

- **God's Mercy & Second Chances:** Jonah 3:1-3a - "And the word of the LORD
  came unto Jonah the _second time_, saying, Arise, go unto Nineveh... So Jonah
  arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD."
  - Despite Jonah's epic failure, God didn't discard him. He graciously offered
    another chance.
  - This time, Jonah obeyed immediately. Yielding often follows the hard lessons
    of resistance.
  - `[Write on board: God's Mercy -> 2nd Chance -> Obedience (Jonah 3:1-3)]`
- **The Power of God's Word & Repentance:** Jonah 3:4-10
  - Jonah delivered the simple message God gave him (Jonah 3:4).
  - The result was city-wide repentance, from the king down (Jonah 3:5-9).
  - God responded to their genuine turning by relenting from the declared
    disaster (Jonah 3:10). His desire is always restoration, not destruction
    (Ezekiel 33:11).
- **Nineveh's Example:** Matthew 12:41 - "The men of Nineveh shall rise in
  judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at
  the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here."
  - Jesus highlights Nineveh's repentance as remarkable. They responded to
    Jonah; how much more should people respond to Christ Himself?
  - **(RQ)** Does the repentance of ancient Nineveh challenge our own
    responsiveness to God's Word today?
- `[Aside: Imagine the scene! An entire pagan metropolis, known for cruelty, humbling itself before God because of one reluctant prophet's simple message. Never underestimate the power of God's Word proclaimed in obedience.]`
- **God's Heart for All:** Jonah's story (including his later displeasure in
  chapter 4, not covered today) ultimately reveals God's compassionate heart
  even for those perceived as enemies. Our yielding allows us to be part of His
  mission to reach _everyone_.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen God's clear call (Jonah 1), the high cost of
  resistance (Jonah 1), the blessing found only in _doing_ His Word (James 1,
  Luke 8), and God's power to restore and use yielded lives for His mission
  (Jonah 3, Matt 12).
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - **Need/Question (from text):** How do we overcome our own internal
    resistance (fear, prejudice, comfort) when God's Word clearly calls us to
    act or change?
  - **Biblical Principle (from text):** True connection with God and
    experiencing His blessing comes not just from knowing His Word, but actively
    _doing_ it (Luke 8:21, James 1:22, 25). Obedience unlocks God's power and
    purpose.
  - **Bridging (from text):** Like Jonah, we are often called to step outside
    our comfort zones – perhaps sharing our faith, forgiving someone, changing a
    habit, serving in a needed area. Our "Nineveh" might be a difficult
    conversation or a challenging ministry.
  - **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Identify:** Prayerfully ask God to show you one specific area where
        you know His Word calls for obedience, but you've been resistant
        (Reflect on James 1:22).
    2.  **Pray for Willingness:** Ask God for the desire and strength to obey,
        saying like Jesus, "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).
    3.  **Take One Step:** This week, take one concrete, small step of obedience
        in that identified area (Reflect on Jonah 3:3a - "So Jonah arose, and
        went...").
- **Invitation:** God's Word came to Jonah twice. It comes to us daily through
  Scripture and the Holy Spirit's prompting. Will we be hearers only, or will we
  choose the blessed path of the doer? Let's commit today to trust and obey,
  yielding our will to His perfect plan. (Connect to Closing Hymn: "Trust and
  Obey").
