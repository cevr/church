### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Startling statistic about youth leaving faith OR a brief story of
  someone facing pressure far from home.
- **Relevance:** Why study Daniel today? Prophetic book for the last generation.
  - Shows how to live faithfully in a hostile environment ('Babylon') (Rev
    18:4).
- **Introduce Theme:** Far From Home, Close to God - Daniel's experience as a
  captive.
- **Central Verse Introduction:** Daniel 1:8 - The pivotal choice.
- **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the study's flow (Context -> Test -> Resolve ->
  Blessing -> Application).

### Context: The Great Controversy & Captivity (Dan 1:1-2) (10 min)

- **The Setting:** Daniel 1:1 - Nebuchadnezzar besieges Jerusalem.
  - Why? Israel's unfaithfulness (Ref. 2 Chron 36:15-17).
  - Sin leads to separation and captivity – a microcosm of the Great Controversy
    between Christ and Satan.
- **Symbolism:**
  - [Write on board: Jerusalem = Loyalty, Faithfulness, God's Law]
  - [Write on board: Babylon = Rebellion, Apostasy, False Worship, Confusion]
  - This conflict is central to Daniel and Revelation.
- **God's Sovereignty:** Daniel 1:2 - "And the Lord gave Jehoiakim... into his
  hand..."
  - God wasn't defeated; He allowed this for His purposes (discipline, witness).
  - [Whiteboard: God is NEVER caught unprepared. His plans triumph.]
  - Connect to Jeremiah 29:11 - God has plans even in 'Babylon'.
  - **(RQ):** If God allowed this captivity, what does it teach us about His
    response to persistent sin and His ultimate control even in apparent defeat?
- **The Captives:** Young nobles taken (Dan 1:3-4) - Satan often targets the
  best and brightest to neutralize their influence for God.

### The Test in Babylon: Pressure & Resolve (Dan 1:5, 8) (12 min) [*]

- **Assimilation Pressure:** Daniel 1:5 - King's provision (food & wine),
  education, name changes (Dan 1:7).
  - Goal: Erase Hebrew identity, absorb into Babylonian culture. Make them
    forget God's law and ways.
  - **(RQ):** Where do we face subtle pressures to conform to worldly standards
    today (entertainment, diet, priorities)?
- **The Specific Test:** King's food/wine.
  - Why refuse? Likely involved unclean meats (Lev 11) and food offered to idols
    (Ex 34:15; Acts 15:29). Defilement.
  - Seemingly small issue, but represented loyalty to God's specific commands.
- **Daniel's Resolve:** Daniel 1:8 - "But Daniel purposed in his heart..."
  - [Write on board: Daniel 1:8 - "Purposed in his heart" = A deliberate choice
    of the WILL, based on God's Word]
  - Not impulsive; a settled decision based on principle _before_ the temptation
    intensified.
  - **Individual Choice is Key:** God doesn't force obedience; He invites
    allegiance (Josh 24:15).
  - [Write on board: Our Choice (Will) + God's Power (Holy Spirit) =
    Faithfulness]
  - **[Illustration/Analogy]:** _Think of setting a GPS destination before
    starting a long drive. Daniel had already set his destination – faithfulness
    to God – before navigating the confusing 'roads' and tempting 'detours' of
    Babylon. He knew where he was going._
  - **(RQ):** What does it mean for us to 'purpose in our heart' _before_ the
    tests of faith come? How do we pre-set our spiritual GPS?
- **Courteous Request:** Daniel didn't rebel defiantly but respectfully
  requested an alternative (Dan 1:8b).
  - Wisdom and tact in approach (Matt 10:16).

### Faithfulness Rewarded: God's Blessing (Dan 1:11-21) (12 min)

- **God Provides Favor:** Daniel 1:9 - God gave Daniel favor with the official.
  - When we choose God's way, even when difficult, He often works behind the
    scenes to open doors (Prov 16:7).
- **The 10-Day Test:** Daniel 1:11-14 - Daniel proposes a test based on God's
  principles (simple diet of pulse/water).
  - Faith in action. Trusting God's ways over the king's perceived wisdom.
  - [Aside: *"Daniel's stand on diet wasn't just about physical health; it was a
    spiritual line drawn in the sand. It reminds us that even our physical
    habits are part of our witness and connection to God, reflecting His
    original design for our well-being (1 Cor 10:31)."*]
- **The Result:** Daniel 1:15-16 - They looked healthier ("fairer") and better
  nourished ("fatter in flesh") than those eating the king's rich food.
  - God honored their faithfulness visibly. His ways are best for body and soul.
  - [Concept: Faithfulness in 'small' things (like diet, daily choices)
    demonstrates trust worthy of larger responsibilities and blessings.]
- **Divine Blessings:** Daniel 1:17 - God gave knowledge, skill in literature,
  wisdom, and understanding in visions/dreams (spiritual gifts).
  - [Write on board: Blessings: 1. Physical Health (v15) 2. Mental Acuity (v17)
    3. Spiritual Insight (v17) 4. Positional Favor (v19-20)]
  - Daniel 1:20 - Ten times better than all the magicians/astrologers in _all_
    matters of wisdom and understanding.
  - Faithfulness leads to God-given excellence that surpasses worldly wisdom.
  - **(RQ):** How does faithfulness in our daily choices (study, work, health)
    position us to receive God's specific blessings (wisdom, opportunities,
    spiritual insight)?
- **Longevity & Influence:** Daniel 1:21 - Daniel continued until the first year
  of King Cyrus – faithfulness has lasting impact and influence.

### Conclusion & Application (6 min)

- **Recap:** Daniel, though physically far from home and under intense pressure,
  remained spiritually close to God through deliberate choice (Dan 1:8) and
  faithfulness to God's known will.
  - He faced the Great Controversy personally in Babylon.
  - His resolve, rooted in God's Word, was key.
  - God honored his faithfulness with significant physical, mental, and
    spiritual blessings.
- **Daniel as an Example:** His experience is prophetic and instructive for us
  living in modern 'Babylon' (a world opposed to God's principles).
  - We face constant pressures to compromise, assimilate, forget God's law.
  - **(RQ):** What is the 'king's meat' (compromises, worldly standards,
    unhealthful influences) being offered to us today?
- **The Need/Question (from text):** How can we stay faithful to God when
  surrounded by opposing influences and pressures to conform? (Dan 1:5, 8)
- **The Biblical Principle (from text):** Purpose in your heart beforehand to
  obey God's Word, trust Him for strength, and respectfully stand for principle.
  (Dan 1:8, 12, 17).
- **Bridging to Practice:** Like Daniel, our seemingly small daily choices (what
  we consume physically, mentally, spiritually; how we respond to pressure)
  reflect our ultimate allegiance and impact our connection with God.
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  1.  **Identify:** Prayerfully identify one specific area where worldly
      pressure tempts you to compromise God's standard this week (Dan 1:5).
  2.  **Purpose:** 'Purpose in your heart' (make a conscious decision, pray for
      strength) to honor God in that specific area, based on His Word (Dan 1:8).
  3.  **Trust & Act:** Trust God for the wisdom and strength to follow through
      respectfully, believing He will provide and bless (Dan 1:9, 12, 17; 1 Cor
      10:13).
- **Invitation:** Choose today, like Daniel, to remain loyal to God, even when
  it seems costly or counter-cultural. Trust Him to sustain you and bless you
  far beyond what the world offers.
- **Connect to Closing Hymn:** Pray for open eyes to see God's truth clearly and
  the key (His strength) to live it out faithfully.
