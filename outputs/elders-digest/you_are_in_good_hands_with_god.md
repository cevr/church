### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** The deep human craving for security. Where do people look? (Wealth,
  status, relationships - all temporary). (Eccl 2:11)
- **Problem:** Insecurity stems from separation from God. Humanity's natural
  state is lost. (Isa 59:2; Rom 3:23).
  - [Write on board: Human Need: SECURITY -> Worldly Sources (Fail) vs. God]
- **Thesis:** Ultimate, unwavering security is found _only_ in a relationship
  with God through Jesus Christ.
- **Introduce Central Verse:** God's explicit promise. (John 10:28)
  - **(RQ)** What kind of security does the world offer versus what God promises
    here?

### Section 1: The Universal Need & Divine Promise (10 min)

- **Humanity's Condition:** Naturally outside God's safety zone. (Eph 2:1-3 -
  'children of wrath').
  - We are like lost sheep needing a Shepherd. (Isa 53:6).
- **God's Initiative:** He seeks us first. (Luke 19:10 - 'to seek and to save
  that which was lost').
- **The Shepherd's Promise (John 10:28):** Unpacking the core text.
  - "I give unto them eternal life": A present possession with future certainty.
    (1 John 5:11-13).
  - "They shall never perish": Divine guarantee against ultimate loss.
  - "Neither shall any man [or anything] pluck them out of my hand": Active,
    powerful protection.
    - [Write on board: John 10:28 -> ETERNAL LIFE + NEVER PERISH + SECURE GRIP]
    - **(RQ)** What does the image of being 'in His hand' convey about our
      safety?
  - Double Security: Also in the Father's hand (John 10:29) - impossible to
    overcome.

### Section 2: Entering and Living in God's Hand [*] (12 min)

- **Entering God's Hand:** Not by effort, but by faith in His grace. (Eph
  2:8-9).
  - Salvation is a rescue operation initiated by God.
  - [Write on board: Entry = GRACE through FAITH (Eph 2:8)]
- **God's Ongoing Work (Philippians 1:6):** Security involves sanctification.
  - He who _began_ the work (justification) will _perform_ (complete/perfect) it
    (sanctification/glorification).
  - [Write on board: Phil 1:6 -> God Starts -> God Finishes (Character
    Perfection)]
  - [Analogy: Think of a master sculptor who starts a precious work. He doesn't
    begin and then abandon it halfway. He carefully guards it, shapes it, and is
    fully committed to bringing it to its intended glorious completion. So it is
    with God and our characters.]
  - **(RQ)** If God promises to complete the work, how should that affect our
    struggles with sin and growth?
- **Security is Transformative, Not Permissive:**
  - Grace teaches denial of ungodliness. (Titus 2:11-14).
  - True security motivates holiness, not license. (Rom 6:1-2, 15).
  - **(RQ)** How can we tell the difference between true assurance and false
    presumption based on lifestyle? (Matt 7:21-23).
  - [Aside: Like a secure child who trusts a loving parent, our security in God
    fosters obedience born of love and trust, not fear or a desire to test
    boundaries foolishly.]

### Section 3: The Foundation and Purpose of Security (12 min)

- **Foundation: God's Unwavering Character & Power (2 Tim 1:12):**
  - Paul's confidence: "I know WHOM I have believed... He is ABLE to keep..."
  - Our security rests on _His_ faithfulness and ability, not our fluctuating
    feelings or efforts.
  - [Write on board: 2 Tim 1:12 -> Security Source = GOD'S ABILITY &
    FAITHFULNESS]
  - **(RQ)** How does focusing on God's ability, rather than our own, change our
    perspective on spiritual challenges?
- **The Perseverance of the Savior:** It's God who keeps us, not we who keep
  ourselves.
  - He is "able to keep you from falling" (Jude 1:24).
  - [Analogy (from Heb 7:25): Christ ever living to intercede - like a constant
    lifeline, always available, always supporting us before the Father.]
- **Purpose: Security Frees Us for Service (Eph 2:10):**
  - Saved _by_ grace, _unto_ good works prepared by God.
  - Security isn't retirement; it's enlistment in His service.
  - [Write on board: Eph 2:10 -> Saved BY Grace -> Created UNTO Good Works]
- **Empowerment for the Weak (1 Cor 1:27):**
  - God delights in using those who rely solely on His strength.
  - Our perceived weakness becomes a conduit for His power. (2 Cor 12:9-10).
  - **(RQ)** How does understanding our security in Christ empower us to step
    out in faith for tasks that seem beyond us?
  - [Aside: Instead of spending resources solely on ourselves, secure believers
    can use even worldly means to advance God's kingdom. It's like finding a
    coinâ€”though from a worldly system, we can invest it for eternal returns,
    demonstrating Christ's love, especially during times like December when
    hearts may be more open.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We have an inherent need for security, met only in God's hands
  through Christ (John 10:28).
- **Basis Recap:** This security rests entirely on God's power and promise (2
  Tim 1:12, Phil 1:6).
- **Result Recap:** Genuine faith and security lead to a transformed life and
  purposeful service (Titus 2:11-14, Eph 2:10).
- **God's Desire:** He persistently offers this security, longing to save, keep,
  and bless (Luke 15 - Parable of Lost Sheep/Coin/Son).
- **Final Thought:** True security isn't the absence of storms, but peace
  _within_ the storm because you are held by the Master of the sea. (Mark
  4:38-39).
- **Invitation:**
  - Have you placed your life, your worries, your future into His capable hands?
    **(RQ)**
  - Commit yourself fully to Him today. Trust His keeping power (2 Tim 1:12).
  - Rest in His security and step out in faith to live the transformed life He
    intends for you.
