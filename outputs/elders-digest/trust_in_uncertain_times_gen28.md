### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: We live in uncertain times. Personal anxieties, global instability. Where do we turn? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce Jacob: A man on the run, facing deep uncertainty (Brief context: Gen 27:41-45).
-   Central Question: How can we encounter God and find assurance when our world feels unstable? `[Whiteboard: UNCERTAINTY -> ?]`
-   Transition: Let's journey with Jacob to a place called Bethel (Gen 28).

### Section 1: The Unexpected Encounter (12 min) - Biblical Foundation (Gen 28:10-14)

-   **Jacob's Condition:**
    -   Alone, fugitive, weary, desolate place (Gen 28:10-11). `[Whiteboard: Jacob: Alone, Afraid, Uncertain]`
    -   Using a stone for a pillow – illustrates hardship, lack of comfort.
-   **The Divine Intervention:**
    -   The Dream: A ladder connecting earth and heaven, angels ascending/descending (Gen 28:12). What does this connection signify? **(RQ)** `[Whiteboard: Ladder = Connection (Heaven <-> Earth)]`
    -   The Lord Above: God reveals Himself directly (Gen 28:13a).
-   **God Speaks - Covenant Reaffirmed:**
    -   Identification: "I am the LORD God of Abraham... and the God of Isaac" (Gen 28:13b). Connects Jacob to the covenant lineage.
    -   The Promises: Land, numerous descendants, blessing to all families through his seed (Gen 28:13c-14). `[Whiteboard: God's Promises (Gen 28:13-14): Land, Descendants, Blessing]`
-   **Key Point:** God meets us where we are, even in our deepest distress, reaffirming His unchanging purposes.

### Section 2: God's Personal Assurance (12 min) - Theological Unpacking (Gen 28:15; Matt 28:20) [*]

-   **Focus Verse:** Genesis 28:15 - God's specific promises to Jacob *personally*. `[Whiteboard: Gen 28:15 - God's 4 Assurances]`
-   **Unpacking the Assurances:**
    -   **1. Divine Presence:** "Behold, I am with thee" (Gen 28:15a).
        -   Not just general oversight, but personal companionship.
        -   Connect to Jesus' promise: "Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world" (Matt 28:20). `[Whiteboard: 1. PRESENCE (Gen 28:15a; Matt 28:20)]`
        -   How does realizing His constant presence combat fear in uncertainty? **(RQ)**
    -   **2. Divine Protection:** "...and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest" (Gen 28:15b).
        -   Guidance and preservation according to His sovereign plan.
        -   Not immunity from trials, but safe passage *through* them towards His goal. `[Whiteboard: 2. PROTECTION (Gen 28:15b)]`
    -   **3. Divine Provision & Purpose:** "...and will bring thee again into this land" (Gen 28:15c).
        -   Implies provision for the journey (acknowledged by Jacob in Gen 28:20 - bread, raiment).
        -   Focuses on fulfilling God's ultimate purpose for Jacob.
        -   [EGW Ref: God provides for our needs - *Sermons and Talks*, 2:329]. `[Whiteboard: 3. PROVISION/PURPOSE (Gen 28:15c, 20)]`
    -   **4. Divine Faithfulness:** "...for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of" (Gen 28:15d).
        -   God's commitment is unwavering. His promises are sure.
        -   [EGW Ref: Remember His promises - *The Faith I Live By*, 23]. `[Whiteboard: 4. FAITHFULNESS (Gen 28:15d)]`
-   [Aside: *"It's easy to feel God is distant when circumstances are hard, like Jacob sleeping on a stone. But Bethel teaches us that God's presence isn't dependent on our feelings or surroundings; His promise is the reality, even when unrecognized."*]

### Section 3: Responding in Faith (11 min) - Practical Application (Gen 28:16-22)

-   **Jacob's Awakening & Realization:**
    -   "Surely the LORD is in this place; and I knew it not" (Gen 28:16). A common human experience! **(RQ)**
    -   Awe and Reverence: "How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God... the gate of heaven" (Gen 28:17).
-   **Jacob's Actions of Faith:**
    -   Worship: Sets up the stone as a pillar, anoints it with oil (Gen 28:18). An act of dedication.
    -   Commitment (Vow): Based *on God's prior promise* (Gen 28:20-22). If God fulfills His word (presence, provision, safe return), then Jacob commits to God as his Lord, establishes worship (pillar), and tithes. `[Whiteboard: Our Response: Recognize -> Worship -> Commit]`
-   **Practical Steps for Us Today:**
    -   **1. Recognize God's Presence:** Actively look for God's hand, even in hardship. Remember Matt 28:20. [Analogy: Like finding stars in the night sky – always there, but need darkness to see them clearly].
    -   **2. Cling to God's Promises:** When uncertain, turn to the Bible. Find promises relevant to your situation (e.g., Isa 41:10, Phil 4:19, Jer 29:11). `[Whiteboard: Action 1: Cling to Bible Promises]`
    -   **3. Actively Trust God's Plan:** Choose reliance on God over self-reliance (Prov 3:5-6). [EGW Ref: Trust God, not 'our own poor human efforts' - *Our Father Cares*, p. 239]. `[Whiteboard: Action 2: Actively Trust (Prov 3:5-6)]` What does this look like practically? **(RQ)** (e.g., Prayer, obedience despite fear, seeking His will).
    -   [Aside: *"Trusting God isn't passive resignation; it's actively choosing to align our lives with His revealed will and promises, like Jacob setting up a pillar and making a vow. It's stepping forward believing He *will* do what He said, even before we see the outcome."*]
-   **Character Connection:** Developing trust in God through life's uncertainties (like Jacob's) builds a character founded on faith, preparing us for whatever lies ahead, reflecting Christ's own reliance on the Father.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

-   **Recap:** Jacob fled uncertainty and found God's unwavering certainty at Bethel. God met him with promises of Presence, Protection, Provision, and Faithfulness.
-   **The Same God Today:** These promises extend to us through Christ (Heb 13:8). He is *our* ever-present help in trouble (Ps 46:1).
-   **The Choice:** Will we lean on our own understanding, leading to fear and anxiety (Prov 3:5)? Or will we acknowledge Him and trust His promises, finding His direction (Prov 3:6)? `[Whiteboard: Choice: Self-Reliance (Fear) vs. God-Reliance (Faith)]`
-   **Final Thought:** Bethel means
