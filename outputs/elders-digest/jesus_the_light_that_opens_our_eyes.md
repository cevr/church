### Introduction (6 min)

- Start with the universal experience of darkness and light. Physical vs.
  Spiritual blindness.
- Introduce John 9: A real-life encounter with the Light of the World.
- Humanity's default state: Spiritual blindness (cf. Eph 4:18, 2 Cor 4:4).
- Central Theme: Jesus came to bring light and sight to a world lost in
  darkness.
- **(RQ)** What does it mean to be spiritually blind today?

### Section 1: Darkness and Divine Purpose (John 9:1-5) (8 min)

- **The Scene:** Jesus encounters a man blind from birth (John 9:1).
  - Represents humanity's congenital spiritual condition.
- **The Question:** Disciples ask about sin as the cause (John 9:2).
  - Common human tendency to assign blame for suffering.
  - **(RQ)** How often do we jump to conclusions about why people suffer?
- **The Divine Perspective:** Jesus corrects them - "that the works of God
  should be made manifest in him" (John 9:3).
  - God can use adversity for His glory and purpose.
  - [Whiteboard: Suffering (John 9:3) -> Opportunity for God's Work]
  - Shifts focus from blame to divine potential.
- **The Declaration:** "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the
  world" (John 9:5).
  - Context: Likely near Feast of Tabernacles (light ceremony). Jesus is the
    fulfillment.
  - He is the _exclusive_ source of spiritual illumination.
  - [Whiteboard: John 9:5 - JESUS = THE LIGHT]

### Section 2: The Encounter and Transformation (John 9:6-12) [*] (8 min)

- **The Method:** Jesus uses clay and spittle (John 9:6).
  - Unconventional, humble means.
  - Echoes creation (Gen 2:7 - dust of the ground).
  - Requires the man's cooperation and faith in Jesus' word.
  - [Analogy (from verse 6): God often uses simple, unexpected means to
    accomplish great things.]
- **The Command & Obedience:** "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam" (John 9:7).
  - Siloam means "Sent". Washing in the pool pointed to the One Sent from God.
  - Obedience _precedes_ the miracle. Faith demonstrated by action.
  - **(RQ)** What 'pools of Siloam' (acts of obedience) does Jesus ask us to
    step into before we see His power?
- **The Miracle:** He washed, and "came seeing" (John 9:7).
  - Immediate, complete physical healing.
  - Symbolizes spiritual sight given through Christ.
- **Initial Witness:** Neighbors are astonished (John 9:8-10).
  - The man's simple report: "A man that is called Jesus made clay..." (John
    9:11).
  - Starts with basic facts. Understanding will grow.

### Section 3: Testimony Amidst Opposition (John 9:13-34) (11 min)

- **Investigation & Division:** Brought to the Pharisees; Sabbath controversy
  arises (John 9:13-16).
  - Encountering the Light often forces a choice and reveals hearts.
  - [Whiteboard: Light Revealed -> Division (John 9:16)]
  - **(RQ)** Why does God's truth often create division? (cf. Luke 12:51)
- **Growing Understanding:** The man declares, "He is a prophet" (John 9:17).
  - His perception of Jesus deepens under questioning.
  - [Whiteboard: Man's View: Man (v11) -> Prophet (v17)]
- **Pressure & Fear:** Parents interrogated, fear expulsion (John 9:18-23).
  - Shows the social cost of identifying with Christ.
- **The Unshakeable Testimony:** "One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind,
  now I see" (John 9:25).
  - The power of personal experience with Christ.
  - Simple, undeniable truth cuts through theological debate.
  - [Whiteboard: John 9:25 = Power of Personal Testimony]
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our transformed lives are meant to be
    embassies of heaven. Even if people dispute doctrine, the undeniable
    evidence of a changed life—moving from blindness to sight—speaks volumes for
    the King we represent.
- **Logical Defense:** The man reasons about Jesus' divine connection (John
  9:30-33).
  - "God heareth not sinners... If this man were not of God, he could do
    nothing."
  - Spiritual insight grows, defends Jesus' origin.
  - [Whiteboard: Man's View: -> From God (v33)]
- **Rejection:** Cast out for his testimony (John 9:34).
  - The cost of allegiance to the Light.

### Section 4: Seeking and Seeing the Son of God (John 9:35-41) (7 min)

- **Jesus Seeks the Outcast:** "Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when
  he had found him..." (John 9:35).
  - Jesus actively seeks those rejected for His name's sake.
  - Offers comfort and deeper relationship.
  - [Illustration Concept (from verse 35): Jesus as the Good Shepherd finding
    the sheep pushed out of the fold.]
- **The Revealing Question:** "Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" (John
  9:35).
  - Moves from physical sight to spiritual faith.
  - The central question for every soul.
  - [Whiteboard: Key Question: Believe on the Son of God? (John 9:35)]
- **Full Confession & Worship:** "Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him" (John
  9:38).
  - Progressive revelation culminates in recognizing Jesus' divinity.
  - True sight leads to worship.
  - [Whiteboard: Man's View: -> Son of God (v38) -> Worship]
- **Judgment & Responsibility:** Jesus clarifies the purpose of His coming (John
  9:39).
  - Light reveals blindness. Those claiming sight while rejecting Him remain
    guilty (John 9:40-41).
  - **(RQ)** How can we ensure we aren't like the Pharisees, claiming sight but
    remaining blind to our need for Jesus daily?

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** The man's journey mirrors our own potential path: born blind ->
  encountering Jesus -> obeying His word -> receiving sight -> testifying boldly
  -> growing in understanding -> worshipping the Son of God.
- **The Reality:** We are all born spiritually blind (Rom 3:23).
- **The Offer:** Jesus is _still_ the Light of the World (John 8:12), offering
  sight to all who come to Him.
- **The Call:**
  - Acknowledge your need for His light. **(RQ)** Where do you need Jesus' light
    to shine in your life today?
  - Believe His word and obey (like washing in Siloam).
  - Receive His transforming power.
  - Share your testimony: "Whereas I was blind, now I see."
- [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Like Jesus used simple clay,
  God can use our everyday experiences, even our past blindness or present
  struggles, as testimonies that draw others to the true Light.
- **Final Appeal:** Don't remain in darkness. Step into the Light. Believe on
  the Son of God today and receive true sight.
