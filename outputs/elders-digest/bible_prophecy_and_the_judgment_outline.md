### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Common views of judgment (fear, earthly focus, confusion). (RQ) What
  comes to mind when you hear 'Bible prophecy' or 'the judgment'?
- **Problem:** Misunderstanding obscures the Gospel message within prophecy.
- **Focus Shift:** Our study centers not on earthly speculation, but on Christ's
  vital work in the _Heavenly Sanctuary_.
- **Goal:** To understand the Pre-Advent Judgment as revealed in Scripture,
  finding assurance and hope in Christ.
- [Write on board: Topic - Bible Prophecy & The Judgment: Assurance in Christ]

### Section 1: The Setting - Heaven's Courtroom (10 min)

- **The True Center:** End-time focus is Heaven's Sanctuary, not a rebuilt
  earthly temple.
  - Scripture: Hebrews 8:1-2 (Christ ministers in the _true_ tabernacle).
  - Scripture: Hebrews 9:24 (Christ entered heaven itself).
  - [Write on board: Heavenly Sanctuary (Heb 8:1-2) vs. Earthly Temple
    Speculation]
- **Prophetic Scene:** Daniel foresees the judgment.
  - Scripture: Daniel 7:9-10 (Thrones cast down, Ancient of Days, books opened).
  - [Write on board: Dan 7:9-10 - Judgment Scene: Thrones, Books]
  - (RQ) What does this heavenly court scene suggest about God's process?
- **The Gospel Announcement:** The First Angel's Message proclaims the judgment.
  - Scripture: Revelation 14:6-7 (Everlasting gospel includes the judgment
    hour).
  - [Write on board: Rev 14:7 - "Hour of His judgment is come" = Part of the
    Gospel]
  - (RQ) Why is the arrival of the judgment hour presented as _good news_
    (gospel)?

### Section 2: The Process - Investigation & Advocacy (12 min) [*]

- **Timing - When Did it Begin?**
  - Prophetic Link: Daniel 8:14 (2300 days -> cleansing the sanctuary = judgment
    begins).
  - Historical Anchor: 1844 marks the start of this Pre-Advent (Investigative)
    phase.
  - [Write on board: Dan 8:14 -> 1844 -> Pre-Advent Judgment Starts]
- **Who is Examined?**
  - Scripture: 1 Peter 4:17 ("Judgment must begin at the house of God").
  - Focus: Lives of those who have _professed_ faith throughout history.
  - (RQ) Why does the judgment begin with God's professed people?
- **The Cosmic Conflict Roles:**
  - The Accuser: Satan's role.
    - Scripture: Revelation 12:10 ("the accuser of our brethren... which accused
      them before our God day and night").
    - [Write on board: Satan = Accuser (Rev 12:10)]
  - The Defender: God defends His people against false charges.
  - The Advocate: Christ's vital role.
    - Scripture: 1 John 2:1 ("we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ
      the righteous").
    - Scripture: Hebrews 4:14-16 (Our High Priest who understands).
    - [Write on board: Jesus = Advocate & High Priest (1 John 2:1, Heb 4:14-16)]
    - [Analogy (from Heb 4): Jesus isn't a distant judge; He's our
      representative who experienced temptation yet without sin, fully qualified
      to plead our case, like a lawyer who perfectly understands both the law
      and his client's situation.]

### Section 3: The Verdict - Vindication & Assurance (12 min)

- **The Basis for Acquittal:** How believers overcome.
  - Scripture: Revelation 12:11 ("They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
    and by the word of their testimony...").
  - Key: Victory rests _solely_ on the merits of Christ's sacrifice,
    appropriated by faith.
  - [Write on board: Victory = Blood of the Lamb (Rev 12:11) + Faith]
  - (RQ) How does relying on the 'blood of the Lamb' answer every accusation
    Satan brings?
- **Vindication of God's Character:** The judgment reveals God's justice.
  - Scripture: Romans 3:4 ("...That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,
    and mightest overcome when thou art judged.").
  - Scripture: Revelation 15:3-4 (Just and true are Thy ways).
  - Purpose: Demonstrates God's fairness in saving repentant sinners and
    condemning sin.
  - [Write on board: Judgment -> Vindicates God's Character (Rom 3:4)]
  - [Aside: Like a public trial clearing an innocent person's name before the
    universe, the judgment clears God's name regarding His dealings with
    humanity and His right to save those who trust Him.]
- **Confidence, Not Fear:** Correct understanding brings assurance.
  - Scripture: 1 John 4:17-18 ("Herein is our love made perfect, that we may
    have boldness in the day of judgment...").
  - Focus: Christ's advocacy and righteousness imputed to the believer.
  - (RQ) How does knowing Christ is our personal Advocate change our perspective
    on the judgment?
- **Acceptance Requirements:** Simple, Gospel-based.
  - Scripture: Acts 3:19 ("Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins
    may be blotted out...").
  - Scripture: Ephesians 2:8-9 (Saved by grace through faith).
  - Basis: Genuine repentance and unwavering faith in Christ's atoning
    sacrifice.
  - [Write on board: Acceptance = Repentance (Acts 3:19) + Faith in Christ (Eph
    2:8)]
  - [Analogy (from Acts 3:19): Think of God's record book. Our sins are written
    there. Repentance and faith in Christ don't just cover the entry; Christ's
    blood acts like a divine solvent that completely "blots out" the record of
    that sin, removing it permanently.]
