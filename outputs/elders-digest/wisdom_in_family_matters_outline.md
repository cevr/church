### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Opening Prayer
- The Challenge: Navigating family life in a complex world.
- Earthly choices, eternal consequences – especially within the family unit.
- Introduce Central Verse: Proverbs 24:3-4. What kind of "house" and "riches" is
  Solomon talking about? **(RQ)**
- [Write on board: Prov 24:3-4 - Wisdom -> Builds; Understanding -> Establishes;
  Knowledge -> Fills]
- Goal: Explore God's wisdom for building strong, godly families based on His
  Word.

### Section 1: The True Foundation - Spiritual Riches (10 min)

- **The Need:** Society often equates happiness with material wealth. How does
  this affect families? **(RQ)** (Prov 11:29 - Trouble own house inherits wind)
- **Biblical Principle:** Spiritual provisions far outweigh material gain.
  - Read Prov 15:16-17. What contrast is drawn? **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Fear of the Lord + Little > Much Treasure + Trouble]
  - [Write on board: Dinner of Herbs + Love > Stalled Ox + Hatred]
  - Discuss: What does the "fear of the Lord" look like in a family context?
    (Reverence, obedience, trust)
  - Discuss: How does love create more value than wealth? (Security, acceptance,
    unity)
- **Bridging to Practice:** How do we practically choose spiritual riches over
  material pursuits daily? **(RQ)**
  - [Analogy (from Prov 15:16-17): Choosing simple family time with prayer over
    chasing overtime that brings stress.]
- **Actionable Steps (from Prov 15:16-17):**
  1.  Prioritize family worship/devotion over acquiring more things.
  2.  Cultivate love and peace actively, even when resources are simple (Prov
      17:1).
  3.  Verbally affirm the value of godliness over possessions.

### Section 2: The Blueprint - Parental Example & Priorities (12 min) [*]

- **The Need:** Children learn values primarily from parents. What example are
  we setting? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle 1:** The power of a righteous example.
  - Read Prov 20:7. What is the blessing promised to the children of the
    righteous? **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Righteous Man -> Walks in Integrity -> Blessed Children
    (Prov 20:7)]
  - Discuss: What does parental "integrity" mean practically? (Consistency,
    honesty, living the faith)
  - [Aside: Our homes should be small reflections of heaven's order and love.
    When parents walk in integrity, they give their children the clearest
    picture of God they might ever see outside of Scripture itself.]
- **Biblical Principle 2:** Setting Kingdom Priorities.
  - Read Matt 6:33. How does this command relate to family life and provision?
    **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Seek FIRST -> Kingdom of God & His Righteousness -> All
    these things ADDED (Matt 6:33)]
  - Connect: Trusting God for provision _while_ prioritizing His kingdom.
- **Bridging to Practice:** How can families tangibly seek God's kingdom first?
  - [Hypothetical Concept (based on Matt 6:33): A family choosing
    ministry/service opportunities even when it means sacrificing some leisure
    or material gain, trusting God's promise.]
- **Actionable Steps (from Prov 20:7 & Matt 6:33):**
  1.  Consciously model integrity in speech and action.
  2.  Involve the family in seeking God's kingdom (church involvement, service,
      mission focus).
  3.  Pray _together_ for needs, acknowledging God as the provider.

### Section 3: Building Character - The Role of Discipline (12 min)

- **The Need:** Children are born with inclinations towards foolishness (Prov
  22:15a). How is wisdom imparted?
- **Biblical Principle:** Loving, corrective discipline is essential for
  removing foolishness and imparting wisdom.
  - Read Prov 22:15. What is bound in the heart? What drives it out? **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Foolishness (Heart) <- Rod of Correction -> Drives it Far
    (Prov 22:15)]
  - Read Prov 13:24; 29:15, 17. What is the motivation and outcome of proper
    discipline according to these verses? **(RQ)** (Love, Wisdom, Rest, Delight)
  - [Write on board: Spare Rod = Hate Son (Prov 13:24); Rod + Rebuke = Wisdom
    (Prov 29:15); Correct Son = Rest + Delight (Prov 29:17)]
  - Clarify: Discipline is not anger-fueled punishment, but loving correction
    aimed at character development and wisdom.
- **Bridging to Practice:** How does biblical discipline differ from worldly
  views of punishment or permissiveness? **(RQ)**
  - [Metaphor (from verses): Discipline as pruning a young tree – removes
    harmful growth, directs towards healthy fruit.]
  - [Aside: Just as God corrects His children in love for their ultimate good
    (Heb 12:6), earthly parents reflect His character when they discipline
    patiently and purposefully, always aiming for restoration, not just
    retribution.]
- **Actionable Steps (from Prov 13:24; 22:15; 29:15, 17):**
  1.  Establish clear boundaries based on God's principles.
  2.  Administer correction consistently, calmly, and lovingly, explaining the
      'why'.
  3.  Follow discipline with reassurance of love and instruction in
      righteousness.

  spiritual riches (Prov 15:16-17), righteous living (Prov 20:7; Matt 6:33), and
  loving discipline (Prov 22:15, etc.).
- **The Ultimate Foundation:** All these principles find their source and power
  in Jesus Christ.

    life.
- **The Centrality of Christ:** Making Jesus the center of the home and all
  relationships is paramount.

    home? **(RQ)** (Grace, forgiveness, reliance on His power, eternal
    perspective).

    and knowledge. He is the source for building the house (Prov 24:3-4).
