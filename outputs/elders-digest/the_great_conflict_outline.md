### Introduction: The Unseen Reality (5 min)

*   Welcome & Prayer
*   The world's chaos isn't random – there's an unseen conflict. **(RQ)** Ever wonder *why* there's so much suffering and confusion?
*   Introduce the Great Controversy theme: A cosmic battle between Christ and Satan, explaining our reality.
*   Central Verse Read: Revelation 12:7-9. This isn't just history; it's ongoing.
*   [Write on board: Great Controversy = Christ vs. Satan]
*   Goal: Understand this framework to navigate life faithfully.

### Section 1: The Cosmic Setting & Origin of Conflict (10 min)

*   **Who is God? The Foundation of Good.**
    *   God's Character: Love, Mercy, Justice (1 John 4:8, Exod 34:6). He desires relationship.
    *   Triune Godhead (Matt 28:19). Perfect unity and love.
    *   His Government: Based on love and freedom, not force. [Write on board: God's Character: LOVE (1 Jn 4:8), JUSTICE (Isa 45:21), MERCY (Ex 34:6)]
*   **Where Did Evil Begin?**
    *   Lucifer's Perfection & Position (Ezek 28:12-15a). Created perfect, high honor.
    *   The Root of Sin: Pride and Self-Exaltation (Ezek 28:15b, 17). Iniquity found *in* him.
    *   Lucifer's Ambition: To usurp God's place (Isa 14:12-14). [Write on board: Sin Origin: Lucifer's PRIDE (Ezek 28:17) -> Rebellion (Isa 14:13-14)]
    *   **The Choice:** God allowed questioning, but Lucifer chose rebellion.
*   **The First Battle:**
    *   War in Heaven (Rev 12:7-8). A conflict of principles, then open warfare.
    *   Satan Cast Out (Rev 12:9). Heaven purified, conflict moves to a new arena.

### Section 2: The Battleground Shifts to Earth [*] (12 min)

*   **Satan's Strategy: Deception**
    *   Target: Humanity, created in God's image (Gen 1:26-27).
    *   Method: Lies, distortion of God's character (Gen 3:1-5). **(RQ)** How does Satan still use doubt about God's Word and character today?
    *   The Father of Lies (John 8:44). His nature is deception. [Write on board: Satan's Tactics: Deceit, Doubt, Distortion (Gen 3, John 8:44)]
*   **The Cross: The Turning Point**
    *   God's Love Supremely Revealed (Rom 5:8). While we were sinners...
    *   Satan's Character Unmasked (John 12:31-32). His cruelty and hatred exposed.
    *   [Draw simple diagram: Cross -> Reveals God's LOVE / Exposes Satan's HATE]
    *   **(RQ)** How does the Cross definitively answer Satan's lies about God being unfair or unloving?
*   **God's Character Vindicated**
    *   The Controversy allows truth to be revealed over time (Rom 3:4, 26).
    *   Every act of history contributes to the case. [Aside: Like a cosmic courtroom drama, the evidence of God's goodness and Satan's evil is presented through history, culminating at the Cross and continuing until the final judgment.]

### Section 3: Our Role and the Path to Victory (12 min)

*   **Choosing Sides: No Neutrality**
    *   Everyone is involved (Matt 12:30). Indifference sides with the enemy.
    *   **The Question:** Whose side are your choices aligning you with? **(RQ)**
*   **Recognizing Satan's Attacks Today**
    *   Temptations: Doubt God's goodness/Word, Presumption on His grace, Independence (seeking life apart from Him) (Gen 3:1, Matt 4:1-11, 1 John 2:16).
    *   [Whiteboard: Modern Temptations: Doubt? Presume? Go it Alone? (Link to Matt 4)]
    *   Focus on Pride: The root sin, still Satan's primary tool against us.
*   **The Path to Victory: Surrender to Christ**
    *   Resist the Devil (James 4:7). How? By submitting to God first.
    *   Be Sober, Be Vigilant (1 Pet 5:8-9). Recognize the enemy and his tactics.
    *   Complete Surrender: Victory isn't in our strength, but in Christ's (Gal 2:20). [Analogy (from James 4:7): Resisting the devil isn't fighting in our power, but standing firm *behind* Christ, letting Him fight for us.]
*   **Character Building in the Conflict:**
    *   Resisting temptation (doubt, pride) *through Christ* builds godly character (Gal 5:16-17, 22-23).
    *   Aligning our will with God's vindicates His way of love and obedience.
    *   [Aside: Our daily struggles aren't random; they are often skirmishes in this larger war. Recognizing the enemy's tactics (doubt, pride) is the first step to victory through Christ, transforming us into His likeness.]
