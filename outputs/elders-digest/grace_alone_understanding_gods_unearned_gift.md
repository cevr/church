### Introduction (5 min)

-   Welcome & Prayer
-   Introduce Topic: The foundational Christian doctrine of Grace.
-   Common Misconception: Grace as a 'top-up' for our efforts vs. God's total provision.
-   **Central Verse Focus:** Read Ephesians 2:8-9.
    -   `[Write on board: GRACE (Eph 2:8) = God's Gift, Not Earned]`
-   Purpose: To explore *from Scripture* what grace truly is and how it transforms our understanding of salvation and service.
-   **(RQ):** Have we fully grasped the radical nature of God's grace as presented in the Bible?

### Section 1: The Foundation of Grace (12 min)

-   **Point:** Grace is God's unmerited favor, given freely despite our unworthiness.
    -   **Scripture:** Ephesians 2:8-9 (revisit)
        -   Emphasis: "not of yourselves," "gift of God," "not of works."
        -   `[Whiteboard: Eph 2:8-9 -> Saved BY Grace THROUGH Faith. Grace = Source, Faith = Channel]`
        -   **(RQ) (from Eph 2:9):** Why does God structure salvation this way, explicitly excluding boasting?
    -   **Scripture:** Romans 3:23-24
        -   Context: Universal sinfulness (v. 23).
        -   Solution: "justified freely by His grace" (v. 24).
        -   `[Write on board: Rom 3:23 -> All Sin | Rom 3:24 -> Justified Freely (Grace)]`
        -   **(RQ):** If *all* have sinned (Rom 3:23), on what basis could *anyone* claim to deserve salvation?
-   **Point:** Salvation depends *entirely* on God's gracious nature, not human merit.
    -   Contrast common 'fairness' arguments with God's sovereign grace.
    -   `[Concept (from Rom 3:24): Imagine a courtroom where the guilty are declared righteous solely based on the judge's character and a substitutionary payment, not their own record.]`

### Section 2: Grace Levels the Ground [*] (12 min)

-   **Point:** God's kingdom welcomes all equally through grace, regardless of background or timing.
    -   **Scripture:** Matthew 20:1-16 (Parable of the Laborers)
        -   Briefly narrate the parable.
        -   Focus: The master's response to the grumbling workers (v. 13-15).
        -   `[Whiteboard: Diagram - Early Workers (Agreed Wage) vs. Late Workers (Master's Generosity) -> SAME Reward (Denarius = Salvation/Eternal Life)]`
        -   Key lesson: The reward is based on the master's *grace* and *promise*, not the *amount* of work done or perceived 'fairness'.
        -   **(RQ) (from Matt 20:15):** Do we sometimes resent God's generosity towards others we deem 'less deserving' than ourselves?
-   **Point:** Rejects spiritual superiority based on heritage, time, or effort.
    -   Connect parable to real-life tendencies (e.g., long-time members vs. new converts, cultural backgrounds).
    -   `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture or hierarchies based on human standards.]`
    -   **(RQ):** How does the truth of Matt 20 challenge any feelings of entitlement or comparison within the church?

### Section 3: The Response to Grace (10 min)

-   **Point:** Service should be motivated by love and gratitude for grace, not comparison or earning favor.
    -   **Scripture:** Titus 3:5
        -   Reinforces: "not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us..."
        -   `[Whiteboard: Titus 3:5 -> Saved by MERCY (Grace), NOT Works]`
        -   If salvation isn't earned by works, then our works become a response *to* salvation.
        -   `[Metaphor (from Titus 3:5): Service is the *fruit* growing on the tree of salvation, not the *root* that earns it.]`
    -   **(RQ):** How does understanding grace (Titus 3:5) purify our motives for serving God and others?
-   **Point:** True humility recognizes total dependence on God's grace.
    -   **Scripture:** Galatians 6:14
        -   Paul's example: Boasting *only* in the cross – the ultimate symbol of unmerited grace.
        -   `[Write on board: Gal 6:14 -> Boast ONLY in the Cross (Grace)]`
        -   Acknowledging our own unworthiness is key to appreciating grace.
    -   `[Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Grace motivates us to see opportunities for kingdom work everywhere.]`
    -   **(RQ) (from Gal 6:14):** What things do we sometimes subtly 'boast' in, other than the cross of Christ?

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Recap:**
    -   Grace is God's unearned, undeserved gift (Eph 2:8-9).
    -   Salvation rests entirely on His graciousness, not our merit (Rom 3:24, Titus 3:5).
    -   Grace welcomes all equally, destroying spiritual pride (Matt 20:1-16).
    -   Our response should be humble gratitude expressed in loving service (Gal 6:14).
-   **The Simplicity:** The Gospel truth is profound yet simple – God saves sinners freely through Christ.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Erase everything except: GRACE -> FAITH -> SALVATION (Gift!)]`
-   **Practical Takeaway:**
    -   This week, consciously thank God for specific aspects of His grace you don't deserve.
    -   When tempted to compare or feel superior, recall the laborers in the vineyard (Matt 20).
    -   Ask God to help your service flow purely from gratitude for the cross (Gal 6:14).
-   **Final Appeal:** Embrace the freedom and humility that comes from understanding you are saved by grace alone. Let this truth transform how you see God, yourself, and others.
