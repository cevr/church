### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) as Jesus' foundational
  teaching on kingdom life.
- **The Core Question:** Jesus spoke profound truths, but what was His ultimate
  goal? Just information, or transformation? **(RQ)** (Reflects James 1:22 - "Be
  ye doers of the word, and not hearers only...")
- Read Central Verse: Matthew 7:24-25. Emphasize the inseparable link between
  _hearing_ and _doing_.
- [Write on board: Hearing + Doing = Wise Builder (Matt 7:24)]
- Briefly state the study's aim: To understand Jesus' call, found throughout the
  Sermon, to a faith that is practiced genuinely from the heart.

### Section 1: Hearing vs. Doing - The Foundation (8 min)

- **The Problem:** Hearing without Doing
  - Read Matthew 7:26-27 (The foolish builder).
  - What's the critical difference? Not _hearing_, but _acting_ on what is heard
    (Matt 7:26). **(RQ)**
  - [Whiteboard: Hearing ONLY = Foolish Builder (Matt 7:26)]
- **Jesus' Intent:** Practical Righteousness Rooted in His Word
  - His teachings demand application, not just intellectual agreement (Matt
    7:24 - "heareth these sayings of mine, _and doeth them_").
  - [Analogy (from Matt 7:24-27): Faith like building a house - requires solid
    foundation (Christ's words) and actual construction (obedience based on His
    words)].
  - This isn't about earning salvation, but the _evidence_ of genuine faith
    transforming the life (James 2:17-18 - "faith without works is dead").

### Section 2: Kingdom Character & Heart Focus (12 min) [*]

- **The Standard:** Citizens of the Kingdom Reflect its Values
  - Introduce the Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-12). These describe the _character_ of
    those who belong to God's kingdom.
  - [Write on board: Kingdom Character (Matt 5:3-12) - Poor in Spirit, Merciful,
    Peacemakers...]
  - These aren't entry requirements, but the _fruit_ of a heart changed by grace
    (e.g., Matt 5:7 - "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy").
- **Beyond External Actions:** Internal Obedience Matters
  - Jesus deepens the law, showing God cares about the heart's attitude, not
    just outward compliance.
  - Example 1: Anger - Not just murder is wrong, but unrighteous anger violates
    the spirit of the law (Matt 5:21-22).
  - Example 2: Lust - Not just adultery, but the lustful look originates from
    the heart and is condemned (Matt 5:27-28).
  - [Aside: Jesus isn't abolishing the law, but fulfilling it (Matt 5:17) by
    revealing its true, deeper intent, which always pointed to the heart.]
  - **(RQ)** How does focusing on the heart change how we view obedience?
    (Connects to 1 Sam 16:7 - "man looketh on the outward appearance, but the
    LORD looketh on the heart.")

### Section 3: Sincere Devotion vs. Hypocrisy (12 min)

- **The Warning:** Performing for Human Applause
  - Jesus warns against practicing righteousness _to be seen by men_ (Matt 6:1).
  - Example 1: Giving - Don't announce your charity; give secretly, seeking
    God's reward (Matt 6:2-4).
  - Example 2: Prayer - Avoid praying ostentatiously in public; pray sincerely
    in private to the Father who sees in secret (Matt 6:5-6).
  - [Write on board: Motive Matters: God's Reward vs. Man's Applause (Matt 6:1)]
- **The Model:** Prayer Focused on God
  - Jesus provides a model prayer, not for rote repetition, but to guide our
    priorities in devotion (Matt 6:9-13).
  - Key elements: Reverence for God ("Hallowed be thy name"), Submission to His
    will ("Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done"), Dependence ("Give us this day
    our daily bread"), Need for Forgiveness/Forgiving others (Matt 6:12, 14-15),
    Reliance on God for deliverance (Matt 6:13).
  - [Aside: The structure of the Lord's Prayer puts God's concerns (His name,
    kingdom, will) before our personal needs, teaching us a God-centered
    perspective.]

### Conclusion: The Call to God's Standard & Practical Steps (8 min)

- **The High Calling:** Reflecting the Father
  - Jesus culminates His teaching with a seemingly impossible standard: "Be ye
    therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matt
    5:48).
  - This isn't about sinless flawlessness achieved by human effort, but about
    reflecting God's character (love, mercy, completeness) through His power
    working in us (cf. Phil 2:13). It's a call to maturity and wholeness in
    Christ.
- **Building on the Rock:** Practical Application
  - Remember the wise builder (Matt 7:24-25). Hearing these truths requires a
    response.
  - **Actionable Steps (Derived from the Sermon):**
    1.  **Heart Check:** This week, when tempted to anger or impatience, pause
        and ask God to reveal the root in your heart (cf. Matt 5:22).
    2.  **Secret Devotion:** Find one specific time/place this week for private
        prayer, focusing on God's priorities before your own (cf. Matt 6:6,
        9-10).
    3.  **Practice Mercy:** Look for one opportunity to show practical mercy or
        forgiveness to someone, even if difficult (cf. Matt 5:7).
- **Invitation:**
  - Jesus invites us not just to admire His teachings, but to build our lives
    upon them through His enabling grace. Will we choose to be wise builders
    this week, putting His words into practice?
- Closing Prayer
