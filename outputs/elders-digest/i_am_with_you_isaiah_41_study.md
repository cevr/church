  facing challenges.

### Section 1: Chosen and Called by God (Isa 41:8-9) (10 min)

- **God's Initiative:** Read Isa 41:8-9.
  - Emphasis on God's actions: "_I_ have chosen thee," "_I_ have taken," "called
    _thee_."
  - This isn't about our merit, but His sovereign choice and love.
- **Who is God Speaking To?**
  - Historically: Jacob/Israel, His servant.
  - Spiritually: Applies to all who accept His call (Gal 3:29).
  - Connect to Abraham's call (Gen 12:1-3) - Chosen for blessing and purpose.
  - Connect to NT believers (1 Pet 2:9) - "a chosen generation... His own
    special people."
  - [Whiteboard: God's Action (Isa 41:8-9): Chosen -> Called -> Not Cast Away]
- **Foundation of Assurance:** Our relationship with God begins with _His_
  commitment to _us_.
  - (RQ) How does knowing God chose _you_ first impact how you view your
    struggles? (Isa 41:9b - "I... will not cast thee away")

### Section 2: The Unfailing Promise: "I Am With Thee" (Isa 41:10a; Matt 1:23, 28:20) (12 min) [*]

- **The Core Promise:** Read Isa 41:10a - "Fear thou not; for I am with thee..."
  - This is the antidote to fear.
  - [Whiteboard: Fear Not <--- BECAUSE ---> I AM WITH THEE (Isa 41:10a)]
- **Immanuel - God With Us:**
  - Connect to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ (Matt 1:23).
  - Jesus _is_ God's presence embodied.
  - (RQ) What does "God with us" truly mean in practical terms?
- **Continual Presence:**
  - Jesus' final promise (Matt 28:20) - "Lo, I am with you alway..."
  - Not just sometimes, but _always_, through _everything_.
  - [Aside: Like a child holding their father's hand in a dark room, they may
    still see the darkness, but the father's presence changes everything. God's
    presence doesn't always remove the trial, but removes the aloneness and
    provides strength *within* it.]
- **Trusting Presence Over Feelings:**
  - Acknowledge feelings of fear/loneliness are real.
  - Emphasize trusting God's _promise_ over fluctuating emotions (Ref: Letter
    52, 1888 concept - faith vs. feelings).
  - (RQ) How can we actively choose to believe God is with us, even when we
    don't _feel_ it?

### Section 3: The Empowering Reality: Strength, Help, Upholding (Isa 41:10b-c; Phil 4:13) (12 min)

- **God's Active Role:** Read Isa 41:10b-c - "be not dismayed; for I am thy God:
  I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee..."
  - Shift from passive presence to active intervention.
  - "I am _thy_ God" - Intimate, covenant relationship (Shepherd, Father).
  - [Whiteboard: God's Action (Isa 41:10b-c): Strengthens | Helps | Upholds]
- **Divine Strength:**
  - "I will strengthen thee." Not our strength, but His infused power.
  - Connect to Paul's testimony (Phil 4:13) - Strength _through Christ_.
  - [Analogy (from Isa 41:10): God's strength like electricity - always
    available, but we must connect through faith/reliance.]
  - (RQ) Where do we need God's specific strength _this week_?
- **Divine Help and Support:**
  - "Yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee..." Repeated for emphasis.
  - God provides aid and prevents collapse.
  - "...with the right hand of my righteousness." Symbol of His power and
    faithfulness acting on our behalf.
  - Connect to practical dependence: Accepting His help (Matt 11:28-30 - Come
    unto Me...). Asking for it.
- **Prioritizing His Service:**
  - God provides for those who prioritize His kingdom (Ref: MH 481 concept).
  - Trusting His strength/help enables us to serve Him even amidst difficulties.
  - [Aside: When we focus on God's work despite our challenges, it's like
    shifting our gaze from the waves to Christ. His power becomes more evident
    as we step out in faith for His purposes, finding His provision sufficient.]
