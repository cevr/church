### Introduction (6 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with the lawyer's crucial question: "Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" (Luke 10:25). A universal question.
-   **Context:** Jesus points him back to the law - Love God, Love Neighbor (Luke 10:26-28). The foundation of all true religion.
-   **The Setup:** The lawyer, seeking self-justification, asks: "And who is my neighbor?" (Luke 10:29). `[Write on board: Luke 10:29 - "Who is my neighbor?"]` A question revealing a limited view.
-   **Purpose:** Jesus answers with a story, not a definition, to reveal the *heart* of neighborly love. This study explores that heart.

### Section 1: The Setting & The Failure of Religion (10 min)

-   **The Scene:** A traveler attacked, stripped, wounded, left half dead (Luke 10:30).
    -   Represents humanity, wounded and helpless due to sin.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Man = Wounded Humanity]`
-   **The Religious Passersby:**
    -   Priest (Luke 10:31) & Levite (Luke 10:32): Represented the established religious system, knowledgeable in the law.
    -   Their Action: Saw the need, understood the situation, but consciously chose to "pass by on the other side."
    -   Why did they pass by? **(RQ)** (Fear of defilement? Inconvenience? Lack of compassion? Prioritizing ritual over mercy?) `[Note Lev 21:1-3 context vs. principle of mercy]`
-   **The Failure:** Demonstrates that religious affiliation or knowledge alone is insufficient. True religion requires action.
    -   James 1:27: "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world." `[Write on board: James 1:27 - Pure religion = Active Compassion + Personal Holiness]`
    -   How often do our routines, preferences, or even interpretations of 'duty' cause us to 'pass by' those in need? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Unexpected Example of True Religion [*] (12 min)

-   **The Samaritan:** (Luke 10:33) A member of a group despised by the Jews. `[Note John 4:9]` An unlikely hero.
-   **His Response:** Driven by **compassion** (Luke 10:33). `[Write on board: COMPASSION (Luke 10:33) -> ACTION]`
    -   **Contact:** "Came where he was... went to him." Overcame social barriers and potential risks.
    -   **Care:** "Bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine." (Luke 10:34). Provided immediate, personal, costly care. `[Analogy: Oil/Wine = Physical & Spiritual Comfort/Healing]`
    -   **Sacrifice:** "Set him on his own beast." (Luke 10:34). Personal inconvenience and cost.
    -   **Provision:** "Brought him to an inn, and took care of him." (Luke 10:34). Ensured ongoing safety and care.
    -   **Responsibility:** Paid the innkeeper and promised further reimbursement (Luke 10:35). Took full responsibility. `[Write on board: Love = Compassion + Action + Sacrifice + Provision]`
-   **The Contrast:** True godliness is measured by the heart's response to suffering, not by labels or lineage.
    -   Micah 6:8: "...what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?" `[Write: Micah 6:8 - Justice, Mercy, Humility]`
-   [Aside: *"It's easy to talk about love in the abstract, but this parable forces us to see it in the concrete details: the bandages, the oil, the donkey, the inn, the two pence. This is love made tangible, love that costs something."*]

### Section 3: The Call to Be a Neighbor (11 min)

-   **Jesus' Defining Question:** "Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?" (Luke 10:36).
    -   Reframes the issue: Not "Who qualifies as my neighbor?" but "Am *I* acting as a neighbor?" `[Whiteboard: Shift: Who IS my neighbor? -> Am I BEING a neighbor?]`
-   **The Unavoidable Answer:** "He that shewed mercy on him." (Luke 10:37). The lawyer acknowledges the *action*, not the person's status.
-   **The Universal Command:** "Go, and do thou likewise." (Luke 10:37). This is the direct, personal application for every listener, including us. `[Write: Luke 10:37 - GO AND DO LIKEWISE]`
-   **Redefining 'Neighbor':** Our neighbor is anyone whose need we can meet. Proximity and opportunity create responsibility.
    -   1 John 3:17-18: "But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth." `[Write: 1 John 3:17-18 - Love = Action, not just Words]`
-   **Representing Christ:** Acts of mercy are how we embody Christ's love to the world.
    -   Matthew 25:40: "...Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me." `[Write: Matt 25:40 - Service to Needy = Service to Christ]`
-   **Character Development:** This isn't merely duty; it's the path to cultivating Christlike character – compassion, selflessness, active love.
-   **Overcoming Our Barriers:** What prejudices, fears, or inconveniences prevent *us* from 'doing likewise'? **(RQ)** How does the Samaritan's example challenge our comfort zones? **(RQ)**
-   [Aside: *"Like the innkeeper entrusted with the wounded man, we are often given opportunities to care for others temporarily. Our faithfulness in these small trusts reveals our readiness for greater responsibilities in God's kingdom."*]
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Luke 10:37 & the Samaritan's example):** How can we "Go and do likewise" this week?
    1.  **See the Need:** Prayerfully ask God to open your eyes to someone in your path (work, neighborhood, church) who is 'wounded' or overlooked. (Reflects Luke 10:33 - "when he saw him...")
    2.  **Move with Compassion:** Instead of 'passing by', intentionally engage with that person. Offer a listening ear, a word of encouragement, or simply your presence. (Reflects Luke 10:33-34 - "had compassion... went to him")
    3.  **Offer Practical Help:** Based on their need and your ability, take one specific, tangible step to show mercy (e.g., share a resource, help with a task, offer prayer, provide practical support like the oil, wine, transport, or inn). (Reflects Luke 10:34-35 - binding wounds, providing care, ensuring provision).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Recap:** The parable teaches that true religion transcends mere belief or ritual. It is active, sacrificial love shown to anyone in need. It's about *being* a neighbor, not just identifying one.
-   **The Ultimate Neighbor:** Jesus Christ is the perfect fulfillment of this parable. He saw humanity wounded by sin, had compassion, came to us (Phil 2:6-8), sacrificed Himself to heal us (Rom 5:8; Isa 53:5), and provides for our complete restoration. `[Whiteboard: Jesus = The True Good Samaritan]`
-   **Our Calling:** As recipients of His immense mercy, we are called to reflect that same love. "Go, and do thou likewise" is Christ's command to His followers.
-   **Reflection:** Who is God prompting *you* to show mercy to this week based on the steps discussed? **(RQ)** What barrier might you need God's help to overcome to act?
-   **Final Appeal:** Let's ask God for the Samaritan's compassion and courage. Commit to seeing needs through His eyes and acting as His hands and feet in a hurting world. Let this parable move beyond understanding to transform our daily actions.
