### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- What is compassion? More than pity. (RQ) How does the world define it vs. the
  Bible?
- Introduce theme: Jesus Christ, the perfect embodiment of motivating
  compassion.
- Central Verse Exploration: Matthew 9:36 - What did Jesus _see_? What did He
  _feel_? What did it _move_ Him to do (context: v. 37-38)?
  - [Whiteboard: Matthew 9:36 - Saw Need -> Felt Compassion -> Moved to Action
    (Prayer/Sending Laborers)]
- Study Aim: To understand the depth of God's compassion shown in Jesus and how
  we are called to reflect it.

### Section 1: The Divine Source of Compassion (10 min)

- **God's Sacrificial Love:**
  - The ultimate act: Giving His Son (John 3:16). This wasn't passive; it was
    active, sacrificial love.
  - [Whiteboard: John 3:16 = God's Compassion -> Ultimate Sacrifice]
  - Compassion originates in the character of God (Exodus 34:6 - slow to anger,
    abounding in steadfast love).
  - (RQ) How does understanding God's sacrifice reframe our view of compassion?
- **Compassion Defined:**
  - Not just sympathy, but empathy leading to action.
  - Greek 'splanchnizomai' (used in Matt 9:36, 14:14) - moved in one's innermost
    being.
  - It's a deep, motivating force rooted in love.

### Section 2: Jesus: Compassion Incarnate (12 min)

- **Compassion in Healing:**
  - Matthew 14:14 - Saw the multitude, moved with compassion, healed their sick.
  - Action followed feeling. He met their immediate physical needs.
  - [Whiteboard: Jesus' Compassion -> Healing (Matt 14:14)]
  - Other examples: Leper (Mark 1:41), Blind men (Matt 20:34).
- **Compassion in Teaching & Feeding:**
  - Mark 6:34 - Saw them as sheep without a shepherd, moved with compassion,
    began to teach them many things (leading to feeding 5000).
  - He addressed spiritual hunger and ignorance out of compassion.
  - [Whiteboard: Jesus' Compassion -> Teaching (Mark 6:34)]
- **Compassion in Comforting:**

    her son.
  - He entered into human sorrow and brought divine power.
  - [Whiteboard: Jesus' Compassion -> Comforting (Luke 7:13)]
- (RQ) What common thread connects Jesus' diverse acts of compassion in these
  passages?

### Section 3: Our Mandate: Living Compassionately [*] (12 min)

- **The Call to Emulate Christ:**
  - We perceive His love/sacrifice, now we ought to act (1 John 3:16).
  - True compassion isn't just words, but deeds and truth (1 John 3:17-18).
  - [Whiteboard: Our Call (1 John 3:16-18) -> Sacrificial Action]
  - (RQ) How does 1 John 3:17 challenge our use of time, resources, and personal
    comfort?
- **Balancing Truth and Gentleness:**
  - Character development (resilience, sanctification) is vital, but must be
    balanced with Christ's gentleness.
  - "We need to cultivate heavenly tenderness, pity, and compassion." (EGW,
    Testimonies, Vol. 6, p. 268).
  - [Whiteboard: Character = Truth/Strength + Compassion/Gentleness (EGW T6
    268)]
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our interactions should represent the
    compassionate nature of the kingdom we represent, even when sharing
    difficult truths.]
- **Compassion in Our Prophetic Mission:**
  - Adventists carry the eternal gospel (Rev 14:6-7).
  - How can we deliver urgent messages without Christ's compassion? (RQ) Does
    our presentation reflect the One who wept over Jerusalem (Luke 19:41)?
  - [Whiteboard: Rev 14 (Mission) + Matt 9:36 (Motive) = Effective Witness]
- **Meeting Holistically:**
  - Addressing social needs ('social gospel') AND eternal salvation
    ('everlasting gospel').
  - Jesus did both. We must too (Matthew 25:35-40).
  - [Brief Illustration Concept (from Matt 25): Seeing Christ in the needy -
    changes our perspective from duty to privilege.]
  - Compassion opens doors for sharing Jesus' saving grace.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:**
  - God's compassion is sacrificial (John 3:16).
  - Jesus perfectly modeled compassion in action (Matt 9:36, 14:14).
  - We are called to reflect this same active, sacrificial compassion (1 John
    3:16-18).
- **The Bridge to Hearts:**
  - Compassion isn't optional; it's the method Christ used (Ministry of Healing,
    p. 143 - Christ's method alone...). It validates our message.
  - It demonstrates the love of the God we proclaim.
- **Personal Reflection & Invitation:**
  - (RQ) Where have I felt God's compassion in my life?
  - (RQ) How can I, this week, intentionally show Christ's compassion to someone
    He places in my path (based on Matt 25:35-40 or 1 John 3:17)?
  - [Whiteboard: Action Step? Pray for eyes to see needs (like Jesus in Matt
    9:36) & courage to act.]
- Final Prayer: Asking for a heart filled with Christ's compassion.
