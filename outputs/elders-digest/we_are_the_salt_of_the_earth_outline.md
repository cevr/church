### Introduction (5 min)

*   Greeting & Prayer
*   Introduce the concept: Jesus' powerful metaphor in the Sermon on the Mount.
*   Read Central Verse: Matthew 5:13.
*   **RQ:** What did Jesus mean by calling His followers 'salt'? What was salt used for in His time?
*   Brief overview: We'll explore the meaning, the functions, the danger, and the maintenance of our spiritual 'saltiness'.
*   [Write on board: Matthew 5:13 - "Ye are the SALT of the earth"] 

### Section 1: The Call to Be Salt (10 min)

*   **Context:** Immediately follows the Beatitudes (Matt 5:3-12). The character described there *is* the salt.
    *   [Write on board: Beatitudes (Character) -> Salt (Influence)]
*   **Identity, Not Suggestion:** Jesus states "Ye *are* the salt," not "try to be."
    *   This is the inherent nature/purpose of a true disciple.
*   **The World's Need:** Implies the 'earth' needs salt – it's prone to decay, blandness, impurity.
    *   **RQ:** In what ways does our world show signs of moral/spiritual decay? (Connect to need for preservation)
*   **Initial Understanding:** Salt's primary roles: Preserving, Flavoring.
    *   [Write on board: Salt = Preserves + Flavors]

### Section 2: The Functions of Spiritual Salt [*] (12 min)

*   **A. Preserving Influence:** Counteracting moral decay.
    *   Scripture: Gen 18:23-33 (Abraham's plea for Sodom - righteous presence matters).
    *   How: Upholding truth, living godly lives amidst corruption.
    *   [Whiteboard: Function 1: PRESERVE (Against Decay) - Gen 18]
    *   **RQ:** How does living according to God's law (Ex 20) act as a preservative in society?
*   **B. Penetrating Influence:** Actively engaging, not isolating.
    *   Scripture: Matthew 5:16 - "Let your light so shine before men..."
    *   How: Salt must contact the substance it affects. We must engage with the world (not be *of* it - John 17:15-16).
    *   [Whiteboard: Function 2: PENETRATE (Engage) - Matt 5:16]
    *   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies, our lives in the world should represent the values of heaven, offering a glimpse of God's kingdom amidst earthly cultures.]
*   **C. Purifying Influence:** Reflecting Christ's character.
    *   Scripture: 1 Peter 1:15-16 - "But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation..."
    *   How: Holiness isn't just separation *from* sin, but dedication *to* God, which has a cleansing effect on our surroundings.
    *   [Whiteboard: Function 3: PURIFY (Reflect Holiness) - 1 Pet 1:15-16]
    *   [Analogy (from 1 Pet 1:15-16): Like a water filter, a holy life removes impurities from its sphere of influence.]
*   **D. Pleasing Influence (Flavor):** Adding spiritual zest.
    *   Scripture: Colossians 4:6 - "Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt..."
    *   Scripture: Galatians 5:22-23 (Fruit of the Spirit - love, joy, peace... add 'flavor').
    *   How: Demonstrating the attractiveness of a Christ-filled life.
    *   [Whiteboard: Function 4: FLAVOR (Spiritual Zest) - Col 4:6, Gal 5:22-23]
*   **E. Promoting Thirst:** Creating desire for Jesus.
    *   Scripture: John 7:37-38 (Jesus the source of living water).
    *   Scripture: 1 Peter 3:15 (Giving a reason for the hope within).
    *   How: A genuinely salty life makes others thirsty for the Source of that life.
    *   [Whiteboard: Function 5: PROMOTE THIRST (For Jesus) - John 7:37, 1 Pet 3:15]
    *   **RQ:** When people see our lives, do they become curious about the God we serve? (Connects to Matt 5:16)

### Section 3: The Danger of Tasteless Salt (12 min)

*   **The Warning:** Matthew 5:13b - "...but if the salt have lost his savour..."
*   **Parallel:** Luke 14:34-35 - "Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out."
    *   [Write on board: WARNING: Lost Savour (Matt 5:13b, Luke 14:34)]
*   **How Salt Loses Savour:** (Chemically pure salt doesn't, but impure salt common then could have soluble elements washed away, leaving useless minerals).
    *   Spiritually: Through compromise with the world (1 John 2:15-17), neglecting relationship with Christ (John 15:4-6), doctrinal compromise, failure to live out professed faith (James 2:17).
    *   [Whiteboard: Causes: Compromise, Neglect, Unbelief -> Loss of Influence]
    *   **RQ:** What compromises might tempt a Christian today to lose their 'saltiness'?
*   **The Consequence:** "Good for nothing... cast out... trodden under foot."
    *   Useless for God's purpose. Loss of influence and divine usefulness.
    *   Spiritual Rejection: A solemn warning about the state of ineffective, compromised faith.
    *   Reference: EGW, RH Oct 15, 1901 - Emphasizes the uselessness and rejection of those who lose their spiritual influence through worldliness.
    *   [Write on board: Consequence: Uselessness -> Rejection (Matt 5:13c)]
    *   [Aside: Instead of conforming to worldly trends, especially during popular seasons, we can use these times to be distinctly 'salty'. It's like finding a worldly coin—we can redirect it for kingdom purposes, offering the preserving truth when culture offers decay.]

### Conclusion: Maintaining Our Savour (6 min)

*   **The Antidote:** Living a distinct, godly life rooted in Christ.
    *   Revisit the context: The Beatitudes (Matt 5:3-12) describe the character that *is* salty – poor in spirit, mourning sin, meek, hungry for righteousness, merciful, pure, peacemaking, enduring persecution.
    *   [Whiteboard: Maintain Saltiness = Live the Beatitudes (Matt 5:3-12)]
*   **Practical Steps (Derived from Verses):**
    1.  **Abide in Christ:** Daily connection through prayer and study (John 15:4) - The Source of our 'savour'.
    2.  **Cultivate Holiness:** Consciously choose thoughts and actions aligned with God's Word (1 Pet 1:15-16, Phil 4:8).
    3.  **Engage Intentionally:** Look for opportunities to preserve, purify, flavor, and point others to Jesus through word (Col 4:6) and deed (Matt 5:16).
    4.  **Guard Against Compromise:** Be vigilant against worldly influences that dilute faith (1 John 2:15).
*   **Final Appeal:** Let us embrace our identity as the salt of the earth. Let's not lose our savour but actively influence the world for Christ, preserving, penetrating, purifying, adding flavor, and creating a thirst for Him.
    *   **RQ (Final Thought):** How will you intentionally be 'salt' this week, based on our study of Matthew 5:13 and related scriptures?
*   Closing Prayer
