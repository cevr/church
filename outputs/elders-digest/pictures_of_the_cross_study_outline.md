### Introduction (6 min)

- **Hook:** The cross is central, but what did it _actually accomplish_ for us?
  More than just forgiveness.
- **Overview:** Introduce four key biblical terms describing the cross's work:
  Justification, Redemption, Propitiation, Reconciliation.
  - These aren't complex theological jargon, but vital 'pictures' of our
    salvation.
- **Goal:** To understand the depth and breadth of what Christ achieved,
  grounding our faith firmly in Scripture.
- **Read Central Verse:** Romans 5:8-10 - Notice key terms already present
  (justified, saved from wrath, reconciled).
- `[Whiteboard: Write Title & Four Key Terms: Justification, Redemption, Propitiation, Reconciliation]`

### Picture 1: Justification - Declared Righteous (10 min)

- **The Need:** All have sinned (Romans 3:23). We stand guilty before a holy
  God.
  - `(RQ)` How does the world try to deal with guilt? (Ignoring, blaming,
    self-improvement)
- **The Biblical Principle:** Justification through faith in Christ's sacrifice
  (Romans 3:24-26a).
  - Define: A legal declaration by God that a believing sinner is righteous in
    His sight.
  - Crucial: Based _entirely_ on Christ's merits, not our own works or feelings
    (Romans 4:4-5).
  - `[Whiteboard: JUSTIFICATION (Rom 3:24) = God Declares Us Righteous (Not *makes* us righteous instantly, but *counts* us as righteous)]`
- **Revealing Simplicity:** It's not about _becoming_ perfect first, but being
  _accepted_ as perfect because of Jesus. Faith receives this gift.
- **Bridging to Practice:** This frees us from the burden of trying to earn
  salvation.
  - `(RQ)` How does understanding justification change how we approach God in
    prayer or after we sin? (Confidence vs. Fear)
- **Actionable Steps (from Rom 3-4):**
  1.  Acknowledge personal sinfulness (Rom 3:23).
  2.  Place faith _solely_ in Christ's sacrifice for righteousness (Rom
      3:25-26).
  3.  Rest in God's declaration, not personal performance (Rom 4:5).
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Trust Christ's Record, Not Mine]`

### Picture 2: Redemption - Bought Back (8 min) [*]

- **The Need:** Sin enslaves us (John 8:34) and brings a penalty (death - Rom
  6:23). We are under the 'curse of the law' (Gal 3:10).
- **The Biblical Principle:** Redemption through His blood (Romans 3:24b;
  Ephesians 1:7).
  - Define: To buy back, to pay a ransom price for release from bondage/penalty.
  - The Price: Christ's precious blood (1 Peter 1:18-19).
  - `[Whiteboard: REDEMPTION (Gal 3:13) = Bought Back from Sin's Penalty/Curse]`
  - Christ became a curse _for us_ (Galatians 3:13-14).
- **Bridging to Practice:** We are no longer slaves to sin's _condemnation_ or
  the law's _curse_.
  - `[Brief Analogy (from Gal 3:13): Like someone paying off a crushing debt we could never repay.]`
  - `(RQ)` If we are redeemed, why do we still struggle with sin? (Distinguish
    freedom from penalty vs. freedom from presence/power - ongoing
    sanctification).
- **Actionable Steps (from Gal 3):**
  1.  Recognize the bondage sin creates.
  2.  Accept that Christ paid the full price for release (Gal 3:13).
  3.  Live in the freedom He purchased, receiving the Spirit (Gal 3:14).
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Live as Freed, Not Enslaved]`

### Picture 3: Propitiation - Wrath Satisfied (8 min) [*]

- **The Need:** God is holy and just; His wrath is His righteous opposition to
  sin (Romans 1:18).
  - `(RQ)` Is it difficult to think of God having 'wrath'? Why is this necessary
    for a just God?
- **The Biblical Principle:** Christ is our propitiation (Romans 3:25a; 1 John
  2:2; 1 John 4:10).
  - Define: An offering that turns away wrath by satisfying the demands of
    justice.
  - Christ's sacrifice absorbed the righteous judgment our sins deserved.
  - `[Whiteboard: PROPITIATION (Rom 3:25; 1 Thess 5:9) = God's Justice Satisfied -> Wrath Averted]`
  - We are saved _from wrath_ through Him (1 Thessalonians 5:9-10).
- **Revealing Simplicity:** God didn't just ignore sin; He dealt with it justly
  _through_ His Son, demonstrating both His justice and His love.
- `[Aside: God's wrath isn't like human temper tantrums. It's His settled, holy opposition to evil that destroys His creation. Propitiation shows His love found a way to uphold justice *while* saving the sinner.]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** We can approach God confidently, knowing His
  disposition towards those _in Christ_ is favor, not condemnation.
- **Actionable Steps (from 1 Thess 5):**
  1.  Acknowledge the reality and justice of God's wrath against sin.
  2.  Trust that Christ fully satisfied that justice on your behalf (Rom 3:25).
  3.  Live in the assurance that you are appointed for salvation, not wrath (1
      Thess 5:9).
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Approach God with Confidence (Heb 4:16)]`

### Picture 4: Reconciliation - Relationship Restored (7 min)

- **The Need:** Sin creates enmity, separation between us and God (Isaiah 59:2;
  Colossians 1:21). We were His enemies (Romans 5:10).
- **The Biblical Principle:** Reconciliation through Christ's death (Romans
  5:10-11; 2 Corinthians 5:18-20).
  - Define: The restoration of a broken relationship, moving from hostility to
    peace.
  - God took the initiative while we were still enemies.
  - `[Whiteboard: RECONCILIATION (Rom 5:1, 10) = Enemies -> Friends/Children; Hostility -> Peace]`
  - Result: Peace _with_ God (Romans 5:1), Access to God (Romans 5:2).
- **Revealing Simplicity:** Salvation isn't just a legal transaction; it's
  deeply relational. God wants His family back.
- `[Aside: Think of a family feud where the offended party pays the price to bring the estranged child home. That's what God did through Christ. He absorbed the cost of our rebellion to restore the relationship.]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** We are no longer distant strangers or enemies, but
  beloved children with direct access to the Father.
  - `(RQ)` How should being reconciled change our daily interaction with God and
    others? (Prayer, fellowship, ambassadorship - 2 Cor 5:20).
- **Actionable Steps (from Rom 5):**
  1.  Recognize sin's effect on the relationship with God (enmity).
  2.  Accept God's offer of peace through Christ's death (Rom 5:1, 10).
  3.  Live as a child of God: communicate (prayer), trust His care, represent
      Him.
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Live as God's Child & Ambassador]`
