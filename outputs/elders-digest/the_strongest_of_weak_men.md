### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: The Paradox - Samson, physically strongest, morally weakest. How? **(RQ)**
-   Theme: God's high calling vs. the devastating power of compromise and self-will.
-   Central Verse Context: God had a specific, divine mission for Samson from birth (Judges 13:5b).
-   Overview: We'll trace Samson's journey through Scripture (Judges 13-16): God's plan, the steps to failure, and the possibility of restoration.

### Section 1: Divine Purpose & Potential (10 min)

-   **God's Specific Plan:**
    -   Nazarite Vow: Set apart for God's purpose (Judges 13:3-5, 7).
    -   [Whiteboard: Nazarite (Num 6) = Separate | Consecrated | Empowered by God]
    -   Point: God has a divine purpose and mission for *each* life (1 Peter 2:9). **(RQ)** Are we living in awareness of *our* divine calling?
-   **Source of Spiritual Power:**
    -   The Spirit of the Lord: The true source of Samson's strength (Judges 13:25, 14:6, 14:19, 15:14).
    -   Point: Spiritual power derives from loyalty to God's purpose and connection with Him (John 15:5).
    -   [Whiteboard: Loyalty to God -> Spirit's Presence -> True Strength]
    -   Key Verse Focus: Judges 13:5 - Consecration linked to mission from the start.

### Section 2: The Gradual Path of Compromise [*] (12 min)

-   **Ignoring Godly Counsel & Prioritizing Self:**
    -   The First Wrong Step: Desire over divine guidance (Judges 14:1-3).
    -   "She pleaseth me well" - Led by sight ('eye-gate') and feeling, not principle.
    -   Key Verse Focus: Judges 14:3 - Rejection of parental/godly counsel.
    -   [Whiteboard: Self-Will ("She pleaseth me") vs. God's Will (Prov 3:5-6)]
    -   Point: Compromise begins when self-pleasing overrides God's known will.
-   **Small Compromises, Big Consequences:**
    -   Breaking the Vow Incrementally:
        -   Touching the Unclean (Lion Carcass - Judges 14:8-9). Key Verse Focus.
        -   Unequal Yoke: Worldly associations/marriage (Judges 14:10ff).
        -   Revealing sacred confidences under pressure (Judges 14:17).
    -   Point: The path to sin is gradual; 'small' compromises erode spiritual defenses (Song of Sol 2:15). **(RQ)** What 'little foxes' are spoiling our vine?
    -   [Analogy Concept (from text): Spiritual foundation cracking slowly due to neglected maintenance/small disobediences.]
-   **Ignoring Warnings & Repeated Entanglement:**
    -   Visiting Gaza (Judges 16:1) - Returning to temptation's source.
    -   Point: Continued self-will blinds us to spiritual danger and God's warnings.
    -   [Aside: Like ignoring chest pains, spiritual warning signs disregarded lead to catastrophe. We must heed the Spirit's promptings immediately.]

### Section 3: The Fall & The Path to Restoration (12 min)

-   **The Final Surrender:**
    -   Persistent Temptation: Nagged into revealing the core secret (Judges 16:16-17).
    -   Key Verse Focus: Judges 16:17 - The ultimate betrayal of his consecration.
    -   Point: One indulged secret sin or character defect, persistently yielded to, can sever the connection with God and nullify our effectiveness.
    -   [Aside: A single hidden leak can sink a great ship. We must allow God to search and cleanse every hidden corner of our hearts (Psalm 139:23-24).]
-   **Loss of Power & Divine Presence:**
    -   "He wist not that the Lord was departed from him" (Judges 16:20). Key Verse Focus.
    -   [Whiteboard: Persistent Sin -> Broken Vow -> Spirit Departs -> Power Lost (Judges 16:20)]
    -   Point: The most tragic consequence – loss of God's presence, often unrealized initially. **(RQ)** Could we be going through motions, unaware God's power has departed due to compromise?
-   **Humiliation, Repentance, & Renewed Faith:**
    -   Consequences Force Reflection: Blindness, grinding in prison (Judges 16:21).
    -   A Glimmer of Hope: Hair begins to grow (Judges 16:22) - symbol of time passing, potential for renewal.
    -   The Final Prayer: Remembering God and His purpose (Judges 16:28). Key Verse Focus.
    -   [Whiteboard: Repentance = Remember God -> Return (Sorrow/Confession) -> Renew Loyalty (Acts 3:19)]
    -   Point: Even after great failure, God offers grace for genuine repentance, restoration of faith (connection), and fulfillment of purpose, albeit differently.
    -   Faith = The vital connection, the true measure of strength.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   Recap: Samson's life – a powerful lesson on God's purpose, the danger of gradual compromise driven by self-will, the reality of spiritual loss, and the hope of repentance and restoration through faith.
-   Central Truth: Our *only* true strength is found in moment-by-moment dependence (faith) and loyalty to God and His revealed will (Prov 3:5-6; John 15:5).
-   **Practical Application - Personal Inventory:**
    -   **Purpose:** Am I seeking/living God's purpose for *my* life? (Study/Prayer)
    -   **Self-Will:** Where am I choosing 'what pleases me' over God's clear guidance?
    -   **Compromise:** What 'small' compromises am I tolerating? (Guard the senses - 'eye-gate', associations).
    -   **Strength Source:** Am I relying on self or on God's power through faith? (Phil 4:13)
    -   **Repentance:** Am I quick to confess and turn from sin? (1 John 1:9)
-   Final Appeal: Choose daily, hourly loyalty to Christ. Guard your consecration. Don't let weakness define you; let God's grace restore you for His purpose. Surrender fully today.
-   Closing Prayer.
