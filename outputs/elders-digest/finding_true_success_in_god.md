### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce Topic: What does _true_ success look like, especially from God's
  perspective?
- Contrast worldly definitions (wealth, fame, power) with a potential biblical
  definition.
- **Central Verse Introduction:** Joshua 1:8 - God Himself defines the path to
  prosperity and success.
  `[Write on board: Joshua 1:8 - God's Formula for Success]`
- Brief overview: Success isn't accidental; it follows God's principles.

### Section 1: Understanding God's Purpose (8 min)

- **The Need:** Why seek God's purpose? Avoid wasted effort, find true
  fulfillment. **(RQ)** What happens when we pursue goals outside of God's plan?
- **Biblical Principle:** God has a specific, good purpose for us.
  - Jeremiah 29:11 - God's thoughts are for welfare, hope, and a future.
    `[Whiteboard: Jer 29:11 -> God's Plan = Welfare, Hope, Future]`
  - Ephesians 2:10 - We are created for good works, prepared beforehand.
- **Bridging to Practice:** How do we discover this purpose?
  - Through prayerful study of His Word (like Joshua 1:8 implies).
  - Understanding His general will (love, obedience, witness) reveals His
    specific will.
  - Aligning our church's mission with God's revealed purpose in Scripture.
- **Actionable Step:** Dedicate specific time this week to pray and ask God to
  clarify His purpose for your life, using Scripture as a guide.

### Section 2: The Necessity of Faith & Courage (10 min) [*]

- **The Need:** God's path often requires stepping out where we cannot see the
  end. Obstacles are guaranteed.
- **Biblical Principle 1: Faith is Essential.**
  - Hebrews 11:6 - Without faith, pleasing God is impossible.
    `[Whiteboard: Heb 11:6 -> Faith = Pleasing God]`
  - ** (RQ)** What does it mean to believe God _is_ and is a _rewarder_?
  - Faith isn't blind; it's based on God's character and promises (Rom 10:17).
- **Biblical Principle 2: Courage is Required.**
  - Joshua 1:7, 9 - Command to be strong and courageous, based on God's
    presence. `[Whiteboard: Josh 1:9 -> God's Presence = Courage]`
  - Philippians 4:13 - Strength comes _through Christ_. It's not self-generated.
  - `[Brief Illustration Concept: Like crossing a dark valley, courage comes not from denying the darkness, but knowing the Guide is with you (Psalm 23:4)]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** Faith acts on God's Word despite feelings or
  circumstances. Courage moves forward _because_ God is present.
- **Actionable Step:** Identify one area where fear holds you back from
  following God's known will. Pray specifically for faith and courage based on
  Phil 4:13 and Josh 1:9.

### Section 3: The Path of Obedience & Commitment (12 min)

- **The Need:** Knowing God's will and having faith/courage is insufficient
  without action.
- **Biblical Principle 1: Strict Obedience.**
  - Joshua 1:7-8 (revisit) - Success linked to _observing to do_ all that is
    written.
  - Matthew 7:13-14 - The way to life is narrow and requires deliberate choice.
    `[Whiteboard: Matt 7:13-14 -> Narrow Way = Life]`
  - 1 Samuel 15:22 - Obedience is better than sacrifice.
  - ** (RQ)** How does 'strict obedience' differ from legalism in light of grace
    (Rom 6:1-2)? (Answer: Motivation - love vs. earning favor)
- **Biblical Principle 2: Total Commitment.**
  - Matthew 6:24 - Cannot serve two masters.
  - Romans 12:1-2 - Presenting ourselves as living sacrifices, transformed mind.
  - `[Aside: Our commitment is like marriage; it's not just avoiding infidelity, but actively cherishing and prioritizing the relationship with God above all else. This total surrender unlocks His full blessing.]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** Obedience isn't picking and choosing. Commitment
  means God has the final say in _all_ areas.
  - Walking in the light (1 John 1:7) means continually aligning with revealed
    truth.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1.  Identify one command you struggle to obey fully. Study the related
      scriptures and pray for willingness.
  2.  Review your priorities (time, money, attention). Do they reflect total
      commitment to God?
      `[Whiteboard: Action -> 1. Obey Known Will 2. Check Priorities]`

### Section 4: Redefining Success (5 min)

- **The Question:** What is the ultimate measure of a successful life according
  to God?
- **Biblical Principle:** True success is alignment with and obedience to God's
  will, resulting in faithfulness recognized by Him, regardless of worldly
  outcomes.
  - 1 John 2:17 - The world passes away, but the one who _does the will of God_
    abides forever.
    `[Whiteboard: 1 John 2:17 -> True Success = Doing God's Will -> Abides Forever]`
  - Matthew 25:21, 23 - The commendation is "Well done, good and _faithful_
    servant." Success is faithfulness with what God has entrusted to us.
    `[Whiteboard: Matt 25:21 -> God's Success = Faithfulness]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** Worldly success is fleeting; eternal success is
  found in pleasing God through obedience and faithfulness in the tasks He gives
  us, big or small.
- **Actionable Step:** Reflect: Am I seeking worldly recognition or God's "Well
  done"? Focus this week on being faithful in your current God-given
  responsibilities.

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen God's definition of true success isn't worldly status,
  but:
  - Understanding and aligning with His purpose (Jer 29:11).
  - Exercising faith and courage rooted in His presence and promises (Heb 11:6,
    Josh 1:9, Phil 4:13).
  - Walking the path of committed obedience to His Word (Josh 1:8, Matt 7:14).
  - Recognizing that ultimate success is faithfulness to His will, which endures
    forever (1 John 2:17, Matt 25:21).
- **Revisit Central Verse:** Joshua 1:8 provides the blueprint: Meditate on
  God's Word, obey it fully, and _then_ you will find true prosperity and
  success.
- **Gentle Invitation:** Are you pursuing the world's definition of success or
  God's? Today is an opportunity to recommit to seeking His kingdom first (Matt
  6:33). Let's choose to meditate on His Word, trust His promises, and walk in
  obedience through the strength He provides. Will you commit to pursuing God's
  definition of success this week?
- Final Prayer
