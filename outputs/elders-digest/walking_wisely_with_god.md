### Section 2: Wisdom in Action - Avoiding Abominations [*] (12 min)

-   **Knowing God's Heart:** Wisdom involves understanding what pleases *and displeases* God.
    -   Focus Text: Proverbs 6:16-19 - Seven things God detests.
    -   [Write on board: God Hates (Prov 6:16-19): Pride, Lies, Violence, Evil Schemes, Eagerness for Mischief, False Witness, Discord]

    -   Hands shedding innocent blood
    -   Heart devising wicked plans (Prov 15:26)

    -   False witness
    -   Sowing discord

    -   Dishonest gain/scales (Prov 11:1)
    -   Wickedness in general (Prov 15:9)
    -   Justifying the wicked/condemning the just (Prov 17:15)

    -   Hypocritical worship/sacrifice (Prov 15:8)
    -   Prayers of the disobedient (Prov 28:9)

-   **The Connection:** Avoiding these isn't just rule-following; it flows from fearing God and valuing His character.
    -   (RQ) How does actively avoiding these things demonstrate genuine 'fear of the Lord'?

### Section 3: Wisdom Reflected - Treating Others (12 min)

-   **The Litmus Test:** Our relationship with God is proven by how we treat others.
    -   Justice and righteousness are more acceptable than sacrifice (Prov 21:3).
    -   [Whiteboard: God <-> Us ===> Others (Prov 14:31, 21:3)]
-   **Focus on the Vulnerable:** God's special concern.
    -   Oppressing the poor reproaches their Maker (Prov 14:31).
    -   Mocking the poor reproaches their Maker (Prov 17:5).
    -   Kindness to the poor is lending to the Lord (Prov 19:17).
    -   Do not rob the poor or oppress the afflicted (Prov 22:22-23) - God defends them.
    -   God protects the widow and fatherless (Prov 15:25; 23:10-11).
    -   [Aside: Our treatment of the vulnerable is like looking in a mirror; it reflects our true view of God's character and His care for *all* His children.]
    -   (RQ) How can we practically apply these principles in our community this week?
-   **Even Towards Enemies:** Wisdom dictates kindness, not vengeance.
    -   Do not rejoice when your enemy falls (Prov 24:17-18) - it displeases God.
    -   Feed your enemy; give them drink (Prov 25:21-22) - God rewards this.
    -   [Analogy (from Prov 25:21-22): Kindness to enemies like heaping coals - not for vengeance, but offering the warmth of conviction and God's love, potentially leading to repentance.]

### Conclusion: The Blessing of Trust (6 min)

-   **Summary of Wisdom's Path:**
    -   Starts with Fearing God (Reverence & Obedience - Prov 1:7).
    -   Involves Aligning with God's Heart (Avoiding Abominations - Prov 6:16-19).
    -   Demonstrated in Godly Relationships (Especially with Vulnerable/Enemies - Prov 14:31, 25:21-22).

    -   He who heeds the word wisely will find good, And whoever trusts in the Lord, happy is he (Prov 16:20).
    -   [Write on board: Trust God + Heed His Word = Blessing (Prov 16:20)]
-   **Practical Application - Actionable Steps:** How can we walk this out? Choose one simple step this week:
    1.  **Practice Reverence:** Set aside 5 extra minutes daily to consciously thank God for His power and promises, cultivating the 'fear of the Lord' (Reflecting Prov 1:7, 14:26-27).
    2.  **Guard Your Words:** Pay attention to your speech for one day, intentionally avoiding gossip or harsh criticism, thus shunning what God detests (Reflecting Prov 6:16-19, esp. 'lying tongue', 'sowing discord').
    3.  **Show Targeted Kindness:** Identify one person (perhaps someone poor, afflicted, or even difficult) and perform a specific act of kindness for them, reflecting God's heart (Reflecting Prov 14:31, 19:17, 25:21-22).
