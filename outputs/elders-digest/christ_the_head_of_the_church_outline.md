### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer.
- Introduce Topic: Christ's Headship – What does it *truly* mean for the church and for us?
- Read Central Verse: Colossians 1:18.
- [Whiteboard: Title + Col 1:18 - "HEAD = PREEMINENCE"]
- Purpose: To explore the biblical foundation of Christ's headship and its practical impact.
- **(RQ):** Do we operate as if Christ is truly the Head, or have other things subtly taken His place?

### Main Content 1: Christ's Absolute Primacy & Authority (10 min)

#### Christ's Primacy: His Interests Supreme
- Colossians 1:18b: "...that in all things He might have the preeminence."
- [Whiteboard: PREEMINENCE = FIRST PLACE]
- Matthew 6:33: "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness..." - This is the foundational priority.
- **(RQ):** What competes with Christ's kingdom for 'first place' in our church decisions? In our personal lives? (e.g., personal interests, human sentiment, worldly claims, pleasing people).
- Dishonoring His Headship: Occurs when anything else takes precedence over His will and cause.
- [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.

#### Christ's Authority: Supreme Ruler
- Matthew 28:18: "And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power [authority] is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
- Ephesians 1:22: "And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
- [Whiteboard: AUTHORITY (Matt 28:18) -> Christ Rules His Church]
- His Word (Bible) is the constitution and law of His church.
- **(RQ):** Do we fully submit to His authority as revealed in Scripture, even when it challenges our preferences or cultural norms?

### Main Content 2: The Church's Dependence & Member Equality [*] (12 min)

#### Absolute Dependence: Helpless Without Him
- John 15:5b: "...for without me ye can do nothing."
- This means nothing of eternal significance or spiritual life.
- [Whiteboard: John 15:5b -> Dependence -> Life Source]
- [Analogy (from John 15:5): Branch connected to the Vine. Severed = spiritually lifeless. Fruitfulness comes *only* from connection.]
- The Church is not merely an organization *about* Christ; it's a living organism *alive in* Christ.
- **(RQ):** Where do we see tendencies to rely on human strategies, programs, or personalities instead of drawing life directly from Christ?

#### Equality Under Christ: Rejecting Human Hierarchy
- Matthew 23:8-10: "But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren... Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ."
- [Whiteboard: Matt 23:8-10 -> One Master (Christ) = All Brethren (Equal)]
- Galatians 3:28: "...ye are all one in Christ Jesus."
- Leadership roles (Eph 4:11-12) are for service, equipping, and pointing people to Christ, not for ruling over faith (cf. 2 Cor 1:24).
- **(RQ):** How can our church culture better reflect this biblical model of servant leadership and mutual respect as equals under Christ?

### Main Content 3: Practical Implications: Cooperation & Self-Examination (12 min)

#### Cooperation: Working Together in His Program
- 1 Corinthians 12:20-21: "But now are they many members, yet but one body. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
- [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 12 -> One Body = Interdependence & Cooperation]
- Local churches, while autonomous under Christ, are part of His *one* body and should cooperate in *His* mission.
- Focus must be on Christ's overall program, not just isolated local interests.
- [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed. (Adaptable concept: Cooperation involves pooling resources/efforts for greater Kingdom impact).
- **(RQ):** How can our local church actively seek ways to cooperate with other believers/churches to advance *Christ's* cause more effectively?

#### Self-Examination: Is Christ Truly Head in *My* Life?
- 2 Corinthians 13:5: "Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves..."
- [Whiteboard: Questions for Self-Examination (based on 2 Cor 13:5 & topic)]
- **Key Questions (derived from points):**
    -   1. Are Christ's interests truly primary in my daily decisions and long-term plans? (Ref: Matt 6:33) `[Write Q1]`
    -   2. Is His rule complete in my heart? Do I readily submit to His Word, even when costly? (Ref: Matt 28:18) `[Write Q2]`
    -   3. Is my faith in Him implicit? Do I live daily in conscious dependence on Him? (Ref: John 15:5b) `[Write Q3]`
- This examination leads not to condemnation, but to realignment with our Head.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Christ's Headship is absolute. It demands His Primacy and Authority, necessitates our total Dependence, and establishes our Equality under Him.
- **Reiterate Central Truth:** Colossians 1:18 - In *all* things, He must have the preeminence.
- The vitality, purity, and mission success of the church hinge on recognizing and submitting to His active Headship.
- **Actionable Steps (derived from Self-Examination & Scripture):**
    -   **This Week:** Before making significant decisions, consciously ask: "How does this seek first Christ's kingdom?" (Matt 6:33).
    -   **Identify:** One specific area where you sense a need for deeper submission to Christ's authority revealed in His Word (Matt 28:18). Pray for grace to yield.
    -   **Daily Practice:** Begin each day acknowledging dependence: "Lord, apart from You, I can do nothing of eternal value. Guide me today." (John 15:5b).
- **Gentle Invitation:** Let's individually and collectively recommit to enthroning Christ as the undisputed Head of His church, starting within our own hearts. Allow His rule to be complete.
- Final Prayer.
