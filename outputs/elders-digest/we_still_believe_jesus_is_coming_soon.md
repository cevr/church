### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- The "Keynote" of Scripture: The Blessed Hope
    - Central Verse: Titus 2:13
    - [Write on board: Titus 2:13 - BLESSED HOPE]
- Foundational Adventist Belief: Christ's literal, visible, soon return.
- Why reaffirm this now? Countering doubt, focusing faith. **(RQ)**

### Section 1: Prophetic Timing - Entering the End Time (10 min)

- **The Longest Time Prophecy: Daniel 8 & 9**
    - Daniel 8:14 - The 2300 Days/Years

        - Brief explanation: Prophetic time principle (Num 14:34, Ezek 4:6).
    - Significance of 1844:
        - End of the prophetic period.
        - Start of Sanctuary Cleansing / Pre-Advent Judgment (brief mention).

- **Understanding the Perceived "Delay" (2 Peter 3:9)**
    - [Write on board: 2 Peter 3:9 - God's Longsuffering = Salvation Opportunity]
    - The delay isn't divine indifference, but divine *mercy*.
    - God's desire: "not willing that any should perish."
    - EGW Insight (Concept from SD 118): Delay allows for character perfection in believers and more souls to be reached.
    - [Aside: Like a loving parent waiting for a wandering child to come home before closing the door, God extends grace, maximizing the opportunity for salvation.]
- **Trusting God's Perfect Timing**
    - How do we maintain faith when the waiting seems long? **(RQ)**
    - Focus on God's faithfulness and promises (Hebrews 10:35-37).

    - Not idle waiting, but active service.
    - Using gifts, time, resources for God's kingdom.
    - Sharing the Advent message, demonstrating Christ's love.
    - [Analogy (from Luke 19): We are like stewards entrusted with the Master's goods, expected to manage them wisely and productively until His return.]

    - Striving to reflect His character now (Col 3:1-4).
    - [Aside: Our daily choices are like polishing spiritual armor for the final review. We desire to reflect the Son's light clearly, without distortion, when He appears.]

### Conclusion: Living in Hope (6 min)

- **Recap of Key Truths:**
    - The Certainty: Grounded in prophecy (Dan 8:14).
    - The Timing: Known only by God (Matt 24:36), extended by His mercy (2 Pet 3:9).
    - Our Response: Watch (Mark 13), Occupy (Luke 19), Purify (1 John 3).
- **The Blessed Hope is Transformative (Titus 2:11-14)**
    - It's not just doctrine, but power for godly living.
- **Trusting God Despite the Wait**

    - [Brief Illustration Concept: For those who die in Christ, the waiting is non-existent. It's like closing your eyes in sleep and instantly opening them to the resurrection morning at His call (1 Thess 4:13-18). The perceived delay is only for the living.]
- **Final Appeal:**
    - Are you truly *watching*? Living expectantly?
    - Are you faithfully *occupying*? Using your life for His glory?
    - Is the *hope* of His coming actively *purifying* your heart and actions?
    - Invitation to embrace this blessed hope fully today.
- **Closing Prayer**
