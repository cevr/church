### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a common scenario illustrating choosing convenience over
  commitment (e.g., hitting snooze vs. morning devotion, easy entertainment vs.
  church service/outreach).
- **The Core Question:** What does Jesus _really_ ask of those who follow Him?
  Is it comfort, or commitment? **(RQ)**
- **Introduce Theme:** Exploring the biblical standard of discipleship – a path
  of radical commitment, not mere convenient association.
- **Central Verse:** Introduce Matthew 10:39. What does it mean to lose your
  life to find it? **(RQ)**
  `[Write on board: Lose Life (Self-Serving) -> Find Life (Christ-Centered) - Matt 10:39]`
- **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the study's flow: The call (Matt 19), the cost
  (Matt 10), the practice (Heb 10, Matt 28), the reward (Matt 10:39).

### Section 1: The Call Beyond Convenience (10 min)

- **Focus:** The Rich Young Ruler – A Case Study in Convenience vs. Commitment.
- **Scripture:** Matthew 19:16-22.
  - The Question (v. 16): He asks, "Good Master, what good thing shall I do,
    that I may have eternal life?" He seeks a _doing_ for salvation, perhaps an
    addition to his already comfortable life.
  - The Standard (v. 17-20): Jesus points him to the commandments – the baseline
    of God's character expressed in law. The young man claims observance,
    perhaps superficially. `[Write on board: Commandments = Baseline]`
  - The Lack (v. 21): Jesus identifies the core issue: "If thou wilt be perfect
    [complete], go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor... and come and
    follow me." This wasn't about poverty being inherently holy, but about
    _attachment_ and _priority_. His wealth was his convenient security, his
    idol.
  - The Choice (v. 22): "But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
    sorrowful: for he had great possessions." He chose the convenience of his
    current life over the commitment of following Jesus fully. His sorrow shows
    the conflict, but convenience won. **(RQ)** What possession or comfort holds
    _us_ back from full commitment?
  - **Illustration:** Like someone wanting to join an elite training program but
    refusing to give up junk food and late nights. The desire is there, but the
    willingness to pay the price (commitment) is lacking.

### Section 2: The Price of Following Christ [*] (12 min)

- **Focus:** Defining the non-negotiable costs outlined by Jesus.
- **Scripture:** Matthew 10:37-38.
  - Supreme Loyalty (v. 37): "He that loveth father or mother more than me is
    not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
    worthy of me."
    - This isn't anti-family; it's about ultimate allegiance. Christ must be
      first. **(RQ)** Where does Jesus rank in our deepest affections and
      decisions?
    - `[Write on board: Cost #1: Christ > Relationships (Matt 10:37)]`
  - Self-Denial (v. 38): "And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after
    me, is not worthy of me."
    - The cross wasn't jewelry; it was an instrument of death to self-will,
      shame, and worldly ambition. It means daily choosing God's will over our
      own desires.
    - `[Write on board: Cost #2: Death to Self (Cross) (Matt 10:38)]`
    - `[Aside: In Roman times, carrying the crossbeam (patibulum) publicly signified submission to Rome's authority and impending death. Jesus uses this stark image for total surrender to His kingdom.]`
  - Connecting to Central Verse: This "losing" of priority for earthly
    relationships and self-will (Matt 10:37-38) is precisely how we "lose" our
    life for Christ's sake, as described in Matt 10:39.

### Section 3: The Practice of Committed Discipleship (12 min)

- **Focus:** How commitment translates into tangible actions within the
  community of faith and the world.
- **Scripture 1:** Hebrews 10:24-25 (Commitment to Community).
  - Mutual Encouragement (v. 24): "And let us consider one another to provoke
    unto love and to good works." Commitment isn't solitary; it involves
    actively building others up.
  - Faithful Assembly (v. 25a): "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves
    together, as the manner of some is..." Regular fellowship (especially
    Sabbath worship for SDAs) is vital, not optional convenience.
    `[Write on board: Commitment = Community (Heb 10:24-25)]`
  - Urgency (v. 25b): "...but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye
    see the day approaching." Commitment recognizes the nearness of Christ's
    return.
  - `[Aside: Early Christians faced real danger meeting together. Their commitment wasn't about comfortable buildings but about essential spiritual connection and mutual support in hostile environments.]`
- **Scripture 2:** Matthew 28:19-20 (Commitment to Mission).
  - The Mandate (v. 19a): "Go ye therefore, and teach [make disciples of] all
    nations..." Commitment involves actively participating in sharing the
    Gospel. It's not passive belief.
  - The Method (v. 19b-20a): "...baptizing them... Teaching them to observe all
    things whatsoever I have commanded you..." This involves leading others to
    Christ and nurturing their growth in obedience.
    `[Write on board: Commitment = Mission (Matt 28:19-20)]`
  - The Promise (v. 20b): "...and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of
    the world." The commitment He asks for comes with His promised presence.
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - **Need/Question (from text):** How do we move from understanding commitment
    to _living_ it, avoiding the trap of convenience seen in the Rich Young
    Ruler and warned against in Hebrews?
  - **Biblical Principle (from text):** True discipleship requires intentional,
    active participation in both the community of faith (Heb 10:24-25) and the
    mission of Christ (Matt 28:19-20).
  - **Bridging (from text):** Just as the ruler clung to possessions, we can
    cling to comfort, free time, or fear, leading us to neglect fellowship
    ("forsaking the assembling") or mission ("Go ye"). Choosing convenience over
    these commands hinders our growth and witness.
  - **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Prioritize Assembly:** Make consistent attendance at Sabbath worship
        and prayer meetings a non-negotiable priority this month (Heb 10:25).
    2.  **Provoke Love/Good Works:** Intentionally encourage one specific fellow
        believer this week through a call, note, or act of service (Heb 10:24).
    3.  **Share Your Faith:** Find one simple opportunity this week to share
        something about Jesus or what He's done for you (Matt 28:19) – perhaps
        sharing a testimony, a verse, or inviting someone to church.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** We've seen the stark contrast: the convenient path chosen by the
  Rich Young Ruler versus the committed path demanded by Christ – prioritizing
  Him above all (Matt 10:37), taking up our cross daily (Matt 10:38), engaging
  in community (Heb 10:24-25), and fulfilling the mission (Matt 28:19-20).
- **Revisit Central Verse (Matt 10:39):** The paradox holds true. Clinging to a
  life of convenience, self-service, and earthly security means ultimately
  _losing_ true, eternal life. Letting go, surrendering our priorities,
  ambitions, and comfort for Christ's sake – _that_ is how we truly _find_
  abundant and everlasting life.
- **Illustration:** Building a life on convenience is like building on sand –
  easy at first, but it won't withstand the storms. Building on commitment to
  Christ is like building on the Rock – harder work, requires sacrifice, but it
  endures eternally (cf. Matt 7:24-27).
- **The Choice:** The call isn't to misery, but to meaning. It's not to
  emptiness, but to fullness in Him. The cost is real, but the reward – Christ
  Himself and eternal life – is infinitely greater. **(RQ)** Will we choose the
  sorrowful path of convenience, or the joyful, though costly, path of
  commitment?
- **Invitation:** If you recognize areas where convenience has crept in, where
  commitment has waned, today is the day to respond to His call. Choose to
  "lose" that convenient life for His sake. Pray for strength to prioritize Him,
  take up your cross, engage with His people, and share His love. Let's commit
  fully to the One who committed His all for us.
