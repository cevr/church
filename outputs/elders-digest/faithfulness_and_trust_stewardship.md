### Introduction (5 min)
-   Welcome & Opening Prayer
-   Introduce Topic: Faithfulness and Trust, specifically in managing God's resources.
-   Define Faith: More than belief, it's active trust leading to obedience (Heb 11:1, 6).
-   Define Trust: Relying on God's character and promises, even when circumstances seem contrary.
-   **(RQ)** How does our handling of finances reveal the depth of our trust in God?
-   Introduce the story of Elijah and the Widow as a foundational example (1 Kings 17).
-   [Whiteboard: Faith = Trust + Obedience (Heb 11:1)]

### Section 1: Faith Beyond Reason (1 Kings 17:8-16) (10 min)
-   **The Need/Question:** How do we obey God when His command seems illogical or unsafe?
    -   Context: Severe famine (1 Kings 17:1).
    -   God's command to Elijah: Go to Zarephath, a Gentile town (v. 8-9).
    -   God's command to the Widow (via Elijah): Make me a cake *first* from your last meal (v. 13).
    -   **(RQ)** What human reasoning would argue against these commands? (Fear, self-preservation)
-   **The Biblical Principle:** True faith obeys God's specific word, trusting His provision over human understanding.
    -   Elijah obeyed (v. 10).
    -   The Widow obeyed (v. 15).
    -   [Whiteboard: 1 Kings 17 - Command -> Obedience (despite fear) -> Provision]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** God still asks us to act in faith, sometimes contrary to worldly wisdom, especially regarding resources.
    -   Reference: *Prophets and Kings*, p. 130-131 - God honors acts of faith, especially hospitality/stewardship.
    -   [Analogy (from 1 Kings 17): Like stepping onto unseen ground because God said it's there.]
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):** Identify one area where God's Word asks for trust over your reasoning. Pray for courage to obey.

### Section 2: Stewardship - Recognizing God's Ownership (Prov 3:9-10) (7 min)
-   Transition: The widow's act was one of faithful stewardship with the little she had.
-   **The Need/Question:** Who truly owns the resources we manage? How does this affect our choices?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** God is the ultimate owner; we are managers (stewards).
    -   Psalm 24:1 - "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof..."
    -   Proverbs 3:9 - "Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:"
    -   [Whiteboard: God = Owner (Ps 24:1) | We = Stewards (Prov 3:9)]
    -   Honoring God with substance means acknowledging His ownership *first*.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Stewardship isn't just about giving; it's a mindset affecting all financial decisions.
    -   **(RQ)** How does viewing ourselves as managers, not owners, change how we view income, debt, spending?
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our finances, managed faithfully, represent the values of God's kingdom, not just our personal desires.]
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):** Review your budget/spending this week. Ask: Does this reflect God's ownership first (Prov 3:9)?

### Section 3: The Command and Promise of Tithe (Mal 3:10) [*] (10 min)
-   Transition: A primary way we acknowledge God's ownership is through tithe.
-   **The Need/Question:** Why tithe? Is it still relevant? What if I can't afford it?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** Returning tithe (10% of increase) is a divine command linked to a promise of blessing.
    -   Malachi 3:8 - Robbing God? In tithes *and* offerings.
    -   Malachi 3:10 - Command: "Bring ye *all* the tithes into the storehouse..."
        -   Storehouse: God's designated treasury for supporting the ministry (cf. Neh 10:37-38, SDA context: Conference treasury).
    -   Malachi 3:10 - Promise: "...prove me now... if I will not open you the windows of heaven..."
    -   [Whiteboard: Tithe (Mal 3:10) = Command (10% to Storehouse) + Promise (God's Blessing)]
    -   This requires the same faith the widow showed – trusting God's provision over perceived scarcity.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Tithing is an act of trust and obedience, not a payment for blessing, but a recognition of God's system.
    -   **(RQ)** What fears or reasoning prevent consistent tithing? (Materialism, lack of trust, misunderstanding)
    -   **(RQ)** How is God inviting us to "prove" Him in Malachi 3:10? (Test His faithfulness through our obedience).
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):** If not tithing, commit to returning a faithful tithe from your next income. If already tithing, reflect on whether it's done with trust or mere habit.

### Section 4: The Spirit of Offerings (Deut 16:17, 2 Cor 9:7) (6 min)
-   Transition: Beyond the commanded tithe, God invites us to give offerings.
-   **The Need/Question:** How should we approach giving offerings? How much?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** Offerings are voluntary expressions of gratitude, given cheerfully and proportionally to God's blessings.
    -   Deuteronomy 16:17 - "Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he hath given thee."
    -   2 Corinthians 9:7 - "Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
    -   [Whiteboard: Offerings = Voluntary + Cheerful + Proportional (Deut 16:17, 2 Cor 9:7)]
    -   Distinction: Tithe = God's owned portion returned. Offerings = Our grateful response with what remains.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Offerings support local church needs, missions, and other ministries.
    -   [Metaphor (from 2 Cor 9:7): Giving like planting seeds – done willingly and expectantly, trusting God for the harvest.]
    -   **(RQ)** How can we cultivate a spirit of cheerful generosity in our offerings?
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):** Prayerfully consider your blessings (Deut 16:17). Plan your offerings purposefully and give cheerfully (2 Cor 9:7).

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)
-   Recap: Faithfulness involves trusting God's commands (like the widow, 1 Kings 17) even when it challenges our logic.
-   Stewardship acknowledges God's ownership (Prov 3:9).
-   Tithe is a specific command demonstrating trust and obedience (Mal 3:10).
-   Offerings are a cheerful, proportional response to God's blessings (Deut 16:17, 2 Cor 9:7).
-   The core issue is trust vs. selfishness/materialism.
-   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom... Just as the widow used her last bit of oil and meal, God asks us to use the resources He provides, even those from a worldly system, to advance His work and demonstrate trust.]
-   **(RQ)** Are we willing to trust God fully with our finances, as the widow trusted Him with her last meal?
-   Reiterate God's Promise: He honors faith (Mal 3:10, Prov 3:10). His blessings aren't always material but always sufficient.
-   Gentle Invitation: Commit today to step out in faith regarding stewardship. Trust God's commands and His promises.
-   Closing Prayer focusing on trust and faithfulness.
