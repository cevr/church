### Introduction (5 min)

- Fear: A universal human experience (Job 14:1, Psa 55:4-5).
- Common fears today: Finances, health, future, failure.
- Introduce the core biblical response: God's direct command and promise.
- Central Verse Introduction: Genesis 15:1 - God speaks directly into fear.
  - [Whiteboard: FEAR vs. FAITH (Gen 15:1)]
- Study Goal: To understand _why_ we don't need to fear when God is with us,
  drawing lessons from Abraham's experience and God's Word.

### Section 1: God Understands Our Fear (Abraham's Context) (10 min)

- Setting the Scene (Genesis 14 recap): Abram returns from battle, victory, but
  potential repercussions.
  - Possible fears: Retaliation from kings? Future security? Lack of heir? (Gen
    15:2-3)
- God's Timing: He speaks _after_ the battle, _after_ the encounter with
  Melchizedek, addressing Abram's likely internal state.
- God's Empathy: He doesn't condemn Abram's potential fear; He meets him in it
  (Heb 4:15).
  - **(RQ)** How does knowing God understands our specific anxieties change how
    we approach Him? (Psa 139:1-4)
- [Whiteboard: Abram's Situation -> Potential Fears -> God's Word (Gen 15:1)]

### Section 2: God's Command & Divine Provision (10 min)

- The Command: "Fear not, Abram" (Gen 15:1a).
  - Not a suggestion, but a divine imperative based on who God is.
  - Echoed throughout Scripture (Isa 41:10, Luke 12:32).
  - [Write on board: Command: "FEAR NOT" (Isa 41:10)]
- The Reason/Promise 1: "I AM thy shield" (Gen 15:1b).
  - God Himself is the protection. Not _giving_ a shield, but _being_ the
    shield.
  - [Analogy (from verse): God as a personal, all-encompassing shield against
    *any* threat.]
  - **(RQ)** What does it practically mean for God to be _your_ shield today?
    (Psa 3:3, Psa 28:7)
- The Reason/Promise 2: "...and thy exceeding great reward" (Gen 15:1c).
  - God Himself is the ultimate reward, greater than any earthly security or
    possession (like the heir Abram worried about).
  - Connects to focusing on the Giver, not just the gifts.
  - [Whiteboard: God IS: 1. Shield (Protection) 2. Reward (Sufficiency) - Gen
    15:1]

### Section 3: Faith Through Delays & Doubt [*] (10 min)

- Abram's Response: Despite the promise, Abram voices his doubt/question (Gen
  15:2-3 - "what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless?").
  - God allows questions born of honest struggle.
- God's Reassurance: Takes Abram outside, points to stars (Gen 15:5) - a
  tangible promise.
- The Nature of Divine Delays:
  - God's timing isn't human timing (Hab 2:3).
  - Purpose 1: Develops perseverance and character (Rom 5:3-5).
    - [Whiteboard: Delay -> Tribulation -> Patience -> Experience -> Hope (Rom
      5:3-5)]
  - Purpose 2: Ensures God receives the glory (John 11:4, 40).
  - Purpose 3: Deepens trust and reliance on God alone (2 Cor 1:9).
  - **(RQ)** How can we reframe waiting not as God's absence, but as His active
    work in us? (James 1:2-4)
- [Aside: Like building spiritual muscle, waiting under God's guidance
  strengthens our faith capacity. It's uncomfortable, but essential for growth.]

### Section 4: Faith in Action (5 min)

- Faith Defined by Focus: Looking away from the problems (fear, doubt,
  circumstances) unto Jesus (Heb 12:2).
  - [Whiteboard: Faith Focus -> JESUS (Heb 12:2), not Problems]
- Faith Requires Action: Abraham "believed in the Lord" (Gen 15:6) and later
  _acted_ on that belief by leaving Ur (Heb 11:8).
  - Faith isn't passive assent; it's active trust demonstrated by obedience
    _despite_ contrary circumstances or feelings.
  - **(RQ)** What's one small step of obedience you can take this week, acting
    on God's promise despite fear? (James 2:17)
- Trusting God's Faithfulness: The foundation for fearlessness is God's
  unchanging character and His faithfulness to His promises (Heb 10:23, Num
  23:19).

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: Fear is real, but God understands (Abraham). His command is clear:
  "Fear Not." Why? Because HE IS our Shield and Reward (Gen 15:1, Isa 41:10).
- Delays serve His purpose (Rom 5:3-5). True faith focuses on Him (Heb 12:2),
  acts on His Word (Heb 11:8), and rests in His faithfulness (Heb 10:23).
- [Final Whiteboard Point: Trust HIS Faithfulness (Heb 10:23)]
- The Simplicity: Fear dissipates when our focus shifts from the enormity of the
  problem to the Almightiness of our God.
- Gentle Invitation: Choose today to consciously shift your focus. When fear
  whispers, answer with God's promise: "You are my Shield." Take one step based
  on His Word, trusting His timing and His faithfulness.
