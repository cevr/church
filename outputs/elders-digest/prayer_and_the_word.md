### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- The Christian life: A journey needing constant connection.
- Two essential lifelines: Prayer (communion) & God's Word (instruction/power).
- Today's focus: How prayer interacts with the Word, especially when feeling
  weak or confused, using Psalm 119 as our guide.
- **(RQ)** How often do we feel spiritually 'in the dust,' disconnected or
  discouraged?
- Central Verse Introduction: Psalm 119:25 - The cry of a soul needing divine
  life. `[Write on board: Prayer + Word = Spiritual Life]`

### Section 1: The Need for Revival (Ps 119:25) (8 min)

- **Read Psalm 119:25:** "My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me
  according to thy word."
- **The Need:** Feeling spiritually low, discouraged, weighed down by earthly
  cares ('cleaveth unto the dust').
  - Relatable human experience. Times of dryness, failure, weariness.
  - **(RQ)** What things in our lives make our souls feel like they are
    'cleaving to the dust'?
- **The Plea:** "Quicken thou me" - Revive me, make me alive!
  `[Write on board: Quicken (Ps 119:25) = Revive / Make Alive]`
- **The Source:** "According to thy word." Not positive thinking, not human
  effort alone, but the life-giving power inherent in God's promises and
  commands.
  - John 6:63 - "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
    life."
- **Application:** When feeling low, don't turn _from_ the Word, turn _to_ it in
  prayer, asking God to apply its reviving power.
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Pray Ps 119:25 when discouraged]`

### Section 2: The Need for Insight (Ps 119:26-27) [*] (10 min)

- **Read Psalm 119:26-27:** "I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me:
  teach me thy statutes. Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall
  I talk of thy wondrous works."
- **Honesty in Prayer (v. 26a):** "I have declared my ways..." - Openness before
  God about our struggles, failures, and path.
- **God Hears (v. 26b):** "...thou heardest me..." - Assurance that God listens
  to our honest confessions.
- **The Plea for Instruction (v. 26c):** "...teach me thy statutes."
- **The Deeper Plea for Understanding (v. 27a):** "Make me to understand the way
  of thy precepts..."
  - Not just head knowledge, but heart understanding of God's principles.
  - **(RQ)** Why is simply reading the Bible not enough? What does
    'understanding the way' imply? (Ps 119:27)
  - `[Write on board: Understanding (Ps 119:27) = Divine Insight]`
  - Connect to EGW, Steps to Christ, p. 110: Need for Holy Spirit's illumination
    beyond human reason.
- **The Result (v. 27b):** "...so shall I talk of thy wondrous works."
  Understanding leads to testimony.
- **Application:** Pray specifically for the Holy Spirit's guidance _before_ and
  _during_ Bible study. Ask God to make you _understand_ His ways, not just know
  the verses.
  - `[Analogy (from v. 27): Word like a map; Holy Spirit like the guide who explains it.]`

### Section 3: The Need for Strength (Ps 119:28) (8 min)

- **Read Psalm 119:28:** "My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me
  according unto thy word."
- **The Need:** Overwhelmed by sorrow, grief, or life's burdens ('melteth for
  heaviness'). Emotional/spiritual exhaustion.
  - **(RQ)** Can you recall a time when your soul felt like it was 'melting'
    under pressure? (Ps 119:28)
- **The Plea:** "Strengthen thou me..."
  `[Write on board: Strength (Ps 119:28) = Divine Power]`
- **The Source:** "...according unto thy word." God's Word contains promises of
  strength.
  - Ephesians 6:10 - "Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
  - Philippians 4:13 - "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
    me."
  - `[Whiteboard: Link Ps 119:28 -> Eph 6:10, Phil 4:13]`
- **Application:** When feeling weak, pray this verse, claiming specific
  promises of strength found in Scripture. Let the Word be the foundation for
  your plea for power.
  - `[Aside: Sometimes strength isn't the removal of the burden, but the God-given ability to carry it faithfully, sustained by His Word.]`

### Section 4: Choosing Truth Over Falsehood (Ps 119:29-31) (8 min)

- **Read Psalm 119:29-31:** "Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy
  law graciously. I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
  before me. I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O Lord, put me not to shame."
- **The Plea for Deliverance (v. 29a):** "Remove from me the way of lying..." -
  Desire to be free from deception, falsehood, hypocrisy (internal & external).
  - **(RQ)** In what ways does the 'way of lying' tempt us today, both
    personally and culturally? (Ps 119:29)
- **The Plea for Grace & Law (v. 29b):** "...grant me thy law graciously."
  Seeing God's law not as burden, but gracious gift.
  `[Write on board: Law (Ps 119:29) = Gracious Gift]`
- **The Conscious Choice (v. 30a):** "I have chosen the way of truth..." -
  Deliberate decision to align with God's reality.
- **The Foundation (v. 30b):** "...thy judgments have I laid before me." Using
  God's Word as the standard.
- **The Commitment (v. 31a):** "I have stuck unto thy testimonies..." - Clinging
  to God's revealed will.
  `[Metaphor (from v. 31): God's testimonies like life-preserver in stormy seas.]`
- **The Plea for Vindication (v. 31b):** "...O Lord, put me not to shame." Trust
  that living by God's Word will ultimately lead to honor, not reproach.
- **Application:** Actively choose truth daily. Measure thoughts, words, actions
  against Scripture. Pray for deliverance from deception and the grace to love
  God's law.
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: Choose Truth (Ps 119:30) -> Align w/ Word]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (Ps 119:32, Hindered Blessings) (6 min)

- **Read Psalm 119:32:** "I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou
  shalt enlarge my heart."
- **Summary of the Journey (vv. 25-31):** From dust to understanding, strength,
  and choosing truth.
- **The Result of God's Work (v. 32):** When God revives (v. 25), teaches (v.
  27), strengthens (v. 28), and delivers (v. 29), the heart is 'enlarged' -
  filled with love, freedom, capacity.
  `[Write on board: Enlarged Heart (Ps 119:32) = Freedom & Capacity]`
- **The Response:** "I will _run_ the way..." - Not grudging obedience, but
  joyful, energetic commitment.
- **The Connection:** Prayer unlocks the power of the Word, transforming our
  inner state and enabling obedience.
- **Challenge - Hindered Blessings:**
  - God _desires_ to revive, teach, strengthen, and enlarge our hearts.
  - Quote concept from EGW, Steps to Christ, p. 94: God longs to bless
    abundantly, but lack of prayer, lack of faith in His Word, often hinders
    Him.
  - **(RQ)** Are we hindering God's desire to work powerfully in our lives
    through neglecting prayerful engagement with His Word?
  - `[Aside: Imagine a water pipe clogged with debris – the reservoir (God's power/Word) is full, but the flow (blessing/strength) is blocked by our neglect of the channel (prayer/faith).]`
- **Final Appeal:** Commit today to combining earnest prayer with diligent study
  of God's Word. Ask Him to revive, teach, strengthen, deliver, and enlarge your
  heart according to His Word.
