### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a common scenario where worldly values subtly clash with
  faith (e.g., prioritizing a high-paying job over Sabbath observance, choosing
  entertainment that contradicts biblical principles, feeling pressure to
  conform socially).
- **Define Worldliness:** Not just outward actions, but fundamentally an
  _attitude of the heart_ that displaces supreme love for God. (1 John 2:15)
  - [Write on board: Worldliness = Heart Attitude (1 John 2:15) -> Lack of
    Supreme Love for God]
- **Central Question:** Where is our primary affection and focus truly placed?
  **(RQ)** Is it on the temporary or the eternal? (Ref. 1 John 2:15)
- **Outline Preview:** Briefly state the marks we will examine through
  Scripture, showing how the Bible helps us diagnose and guard our hearts.

### Section 1: Heavenly vs. Earthly Focus (7 min)

- **The Need:** We are easily distracted by temporary concerns, anxieties, and
  pleasures of this life. (Ref. Parable of Sower - thorns, Matt 13:22)
- **Biblical Principle:** We are called to actively set our minds and affections
  on heavenly realities, not earthly things. (Col. 3:1-3)
  - Read Col. 3:1-3.
  - [Write on board: Col. 3:1-3 -> Seek Things Above | Affection on Heaven |
    Dead to World | Life Hid w/ Christ]
  - Explain:
    - "If ye then be risen with Christ" (v. 1) - Our identity is changed; we
      share His resurrection life _now_.
    - "Seek those things which are above" (v. 1) - An active, ongoing pursuit.
      Where Christ _is_.
    - "Set your affection [mind] on things above, not on things on the earth"
      (v. 2) - A deliberate choice of focus and desire.
    - "For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God" (v. 3) - Our
      old life centered on the world is gone; our true security and reality are
      in Christ.
  - **Illustration:** Think of it like tuning a radio. We can tune into the
    static and noise of the world, or deliberately tune into the clear signal
    from heaven where Christ is. Our "affection" is the tuner. (Col 3:2)

### Section 2: Pride vs. Humility (6 min) [*]

- **The Need:** Worldliness often manifests as pride – self-reliance, seeking
  status, resisting submission. (Ref. 1 John 2:16 - "pride of life")
- **Biblical Principle:** God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
  We must clothe ourselves with humility. (1 Pet 5:5-6)
  - Read 1 Pet 5:5-6.
  - [Write on board: 1 Pet 5:5-6 -> Submit | Clothed w/ Humility | God Resists
    Proud | Grace to Humble | Humble Yourselves -> Exaltation]
  - Explain:
    - "Be clothed with humility" (v. 5) - It's a conscious choice, like putting
      on a garment. It should characterize our interactions.
    - "God resisteth the proud" (v. 5) - A stark warning. Pride puts us in
      opposition to God.
    - "Giveth grace to the humble" (v. 5) - Humility opens the door to God's
      enabling power.
    - "Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God" (v. 6) - A
      voluntary submission to His authority and timing.
    - "That he may exalt you in due time" (v. 6) - True exaltation comes from
      God, not self-promotion.
  - How does seeking worldly status or recognition clash with being "clothed
    with humility"? **(RQ)** (1 Pet 5:5)

### Section 3: Carnal vs. Spiritual Mind (7 min)

- **The Need:** Our natural inclination is towards self-pleasing and things
  contrary to God's Spirit.
- **Biblical Principle:** A mind focused on the flesh (carnal) leads to death
  and enmity with God, while a mind focused on the Spirit leads to life and
  peace. (Rom 8:6-8)
  - Read Rom 8:6-8.
  - [Write on board: Rom 8:6-8 -> Carnally Minded = Death, Enmity | Spiritually
    Minded = Life, Peace | Carnal Mind ≠ Subject to God's Law]
  - Explain:
    - "To be carnally minded is death" (v. 6) - Spiritual death, separation from
      God. Focus is on self and the fallen nature.
    - "To be spiritually minded is life and peace" (v. 6) - Focus is on God, His
      Word, His will, guided by the Holy Spirit.
    - "The carnal mind is enmity against God" (v. 7) - It is fundamentally
      opposed to God's character and requirements.
    - "It is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (v. 7) -
      Without the Spirit's transformation, we cannot truly obey.
    - "So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God" (v. 8) - Living
      according to the fallen nature is unacceptable to God.
  - `[Aside: Paul isn't saying having a physical body is bad. "Flesh" (sarx) here refers to the fallen human nature, dominated by self-interest and opposed to God's Spirit. See Gal 5:16-17 for contrast.]`
  - How does our daily thought life reveal whether we are primarily "carnally
    minded" or "spiritually minded"? **(RQ)** (Rom 8:6)

### Section 4: Possessions vs. Heavenly Treasure (5 min) [*]

- **The Need:** The love of money and material possessions is a powerful snare
  that divides loyalty.
- **Biblical Principle:** It is impossible to serve both God and Mammon
  (material wealth personified). (Matt 6:24)
  - Read Matt 6:24.
  - [Write on board: Matt 6:24 -> Cannot Serve Two Masters | God vs. Mammon |
    Hate One, Love Other | Divided Loyalty Impossible]
  - Explain:
    - "No man can serve two masters" (v. 24) - Jesus states it as an
      impossibility. Service implies ultimate loyalty and allegiance.
    - "Either he will hate the one, and love the other..." (v. 24) - There will
      be a dominant affection.
    - "Ye cannot serve God and mammon" (v. 24) - We must choose where our
      ultimate trust and devotion lie. Seeking wealth as the primary goal is
      incompatible with serving God.
  - Does this mean having possessions is wrong? **(RQ)** Or is it about who/what
    is the "master" of our heart? (Matt 6:24)

### Section 5: Popularity vs. God's Approval (7 min)

- **The Need:** The desire for human approval and acceptance can lead us to
  compromise our convictions.
- **Biblical Principle:** We must choose whether to please men or God; seeking
  to please men disqualifies us as servants of Christ. (Gal 1:10)
  - Read Gal 1:10.
  - [Write on board: Gal 1:10 -> Persuade Men or God? | Seek to Please Men or
    God? | If Please Men -> Not Servant of Christ]
  - Explain:
    - "For do I now persuade men, or God?" (v. 10) - Paul asks rhetorically
      where his allegiance lies in his ministry.
    - "Or do I seek to please men?" (v. 10) - Is human approval the driving
      motive?
    - "For if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
      (v. 10) - A stark choice. Seeking popularity or avoiding offense _at the
      cost of truth_ is incompatible with true service to Christ.
  - **Illustration:** Imagine a soldier trying to follow orders from two
    opposing generals simultaneously. It leads to confusion, compromise, and
    ultimately, failure to serve either faithfully. We must choose which
    Commander we follow. (Gal 1:10)
  - `[Aside: This doesn't mean being needlessly offensive. Paul sought to be "all things to all men" to save some (1 Cor 9:22), but never by compromising the core Gospel message or godly principles.]`
  - Where do we feel pressure to "please men" rather than God in our lives
    today? **(RQ)** (Gal 1:10)

### Conclusion & Practical Application (8 min)

- **Summary:** Worldliness isn't just about specific actions, but a heart
  condition revealed by our focus (Col 3:1-3), our pride/humility (1 Pet 5:5-6),
  our mindset (Rom 8:6-8), our relationship with possessions (Matt 6:24), and
  whose approval we seek (Gal 1:10).
- **Reiterate Central Verse:** The core issue is love: "Love not the world... If
  any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." (1 John 2:15).
  It's a matter of supreme affection.
- **Need/Question (from text):** Our hearts are prone to division and loving the
  "world" (the system opposed to God). How can we guard against this and
  cultivate wholehearted love for the Father? (1 John 2:15)
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** True allegiance requires a conscious
  choice to set our minds on things above (Col 3:2), humble ourselves under
  God's hand (1 Pet 5:6), cultivate a spiritual mindset through His Spirit (Rom
  8:6), serve God rather than Mammon (Matt 6:24), and seek His approval above
  all else (Gal 1:10).
- **Bridging (from text):** In our modern world saturated with media,
  materialism, and social pressure, these biblical principles are vital. The
  "world" constantly competes for our affection through entertainment,
  advertising, career pressures, and social media trends. We must actively apply
  these scriptures to navigate these influences.
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  1.  **Daily Re-Focus:** Begin each day consciously asking God to help you "set
      your affection on things above" (Col 3:2). Pray specifically about the
      day's potential worldly distractions.
  2.  **Humility Check:** In interactions today, consciously choose humility
      over pride. Ask: Am I submitting to God's way, or asserting my own? (1 Pet
      5:5-6). Practice deference where appropriate.
  3.  **Mindset Evaluation:** Evaluate one major input (e.g., media,
      conversation topic) today: Does this encourage a "spiritually minded"
      perspective (life/peace) or a "carnally minded" one (enmity/death)? (Rom
      8:6-7). Adjust accordingly.
- **Invitation:** The battle against worldliness is won not by our strength, but
  by fixing our eyes on Jesus (Heb 12:2) and allowing the love of the Father (1
  John 2:15) to fill our hearts through His Spirit (Rom 5:5). Let us choose
  today whom we will serve (Josh 24:15, Matt 6:24), asking God to consecrate our
  hearts fully to Him. (Ref. Opening Hymn).
