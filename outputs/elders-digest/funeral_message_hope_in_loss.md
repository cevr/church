### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Acknowledge Loss: We gather with heavy hearts to honor [Name],
  support the bereaved, and find comfort.
- Purpose of Gathering: Celebrate life lived, say goodbye, reflect on eternal
  truths.
- The Value of This Moment: Ecclesiastes 7:2 - "It is better to go to the house
  of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all
  men; and the living will lay it to his heart."
  - Funerals benefit the _living_ - prompt reflection on mortality and life's
    purpose.
  - [Whiteboard: Eccl 7:2 - House of Mourning -> Living Lay to Heart]
  - **(RQ)** What does God intend for us, the living, to learn in moments like
    these?

### Section 1: Acknowledging Grief & Questions (10 min)

- Grief is Real and Valid:
  - Jesus Himself wept: John 11:35 - "Jesus wept."
  - He understands our sorrow, shares our humanity.
  - [Whiteboard: Jesus Wept (John 11:35) -> God Understands Grief]
- Questions are Natural:
  - Mary & Martha questioned Jesus' timing/presence: John 11:21, 32 - "Lord, if
    thou hadst been here..."
  - It's okay to bring our honest questions and pain to God.
  - **(RQ)** Does God turn away when we question Him in our grief?
- Avoiding Misplaced Blame:
  - Death is part of the current fallen world: Ecclesiastes 3:1-2 - "To every
    thing there is a season... A time to be born, and a time to die..."
  - We don't blame ourselves or God; death is an enemy (1 Cor 15:26) permitted
    for now.
  - Focus shifts from blame to finding God's presence _within_ the sorrow.

### Section 2: Life's Brevity & Urgency [*] (10 min)

- Life is Brief and Uncertain:
  - James 4:14 - "For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for
    a little time, and then vanisheth away."
  - Proverbs 27:1 - "Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
    day may bring forth."
  - [Whiteboard: Life = Vapor (James 4:14) | Tomorrow Not Guaranteed (Prov
    27:1)]
- The Call to Reflection (Revisit Eccl 7:2):
  - The house of mourning forces us to consider life's fragility and meaning.
  - [Aside: Funerals strip away the non-essential, forcing us to confront what
    truly matters. It's a stark reminder from God to evaluate our own standing
    before Him.]
  - **(RQ)** Seeing life's brevity, what becomes most important?
- The Urgency of Faith:
  - This reality underscores the need to secure our relationship with Christ
    _now_.
  - The most crucial preparation for eternity is accepting Jesus.

### Section 3: The Christian Hope (12 min)

- Sorrow Tempered by Hope:
  - 1 Thessalonians 4:13 - "But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren,
    concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which
    have no hope."
  - Christian grief is different â€“ it's mingled with profound hope.
  - [Whiteboard: Worldly Sorrow (No Hope) vs. Christian Sorrow (HOPE) - 1 Thess
    4:13]
- The Source of Our Hope: Jesus Christ
  - John 11:25 - "I am the resurrection, and the life..."
  - Hope isn't a vague wish; it's centered in a Person who conquered death.
  - [Whiteboard: JESUS = Resurrection + Life (John 11:25)]
- The Promise of Resurrection:
  - John 11:25b-26 - "...he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
    he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."
  - Physical death is temporary for the believer.
  - [Illustration Concept: Seed planted - seems dead/buried, but holds life for
    future bloom at the Gardener's call (Resurrection).]
  - **(RQ)** What does Jesus mean, 'shall never die,' when believers clearly
    experience physical death?
    - Points to eternal life, unbroken connection with God.
- Understanding Death for the Believer (SDA Perspective):
  - Death is a sleep (John 11:11, 1 Thess 4:14).
  - The body rests in the grave, unconscious, awaiting Christ's return.
  - [Aside: Committing the body to the earth isn't finality, but an act of
    faith, like entrusting a precious seed to the ground, knowing the Lifegiver
    will call it forth again.]
  - Our hope is fixed on the resurrection morning.

### Conclusion & Committal (8 min)

- Summary of Hope:
  - We grieve, but with the assurance of reunion because of Jesus.
  - He is the Resurrection and the Life.
  - The vital question remains: John 11:26b - "Believest thou this?"
- Committal:
  - Words reflecting the SDA understanding: Committing the body to the earth,
    dust to dust, in the sure and certain hope of the resurrection through Jesus
    Christ our Lord.
  - Affirming belief in the 'sleep' of death and the awakening at the Last Trump
    (1 Cor 15:52).
- Final Prayer:
  - Comfort for the bereaved family.
  - Gratitude for the life of [Name].
  - Reaffirmation of faith in Jesus and the blessed hope of His return and the
    resurrection.
  - Invitation for all present to place their hope firmly in Christ.
