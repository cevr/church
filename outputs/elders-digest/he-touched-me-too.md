### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the concept of outcasts – historical (lepers) and modern. Leprosy as a type of sin's isolating effect.
- **(RQ)** Have you ever felt like an outcast? Unworthy? Unclean because of sin?
- Introduce the story of Jesus and the leper (Mark 1 / Luke 5) as a profound example of divine compassion meeting human desperation, revealing God's true character often misunderstood.
- State the study's aim: To see how Jesus' touch heals not just the body, but the deep spiritual 'leprosy' of sin within us, calling us to transformation and reflecting His character.
- Read Central Verse: Mark 1:41.
- [Whiteboard: Title - He Touched Me, Too]
- [Whiteboard: Mark 1:41 - Compassion -> Touch -> Cleansing]
- Briefly mention: This encounter reveals the heart of God, a theme echoed in Scripture and confirmed through the Spirit of Prophecy's insights into Christ's ministry.

### Section 1: The Untouchable Touched (10 min)
- **Jesus' Profound Compassion for Outcasts**
    - Describe the plight of lepers (Leviticus 13:45-46) - isolation, uncleanness, hopelessness, often seen as divinely cursed.
    - Read Luke 5:12 - The leper's approach: "full of leprosy... fell on his face... Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean."
        - Note his faith ("thou canst") and submission ("if thou wilt"). He recognized Christ's divine power.
    - Read Mark 1:41 / Luke 5:13 - Jesus' reaction: Compassion, Touch, Word ("I will; be thou clean").
        - Emphasize the *touch* - defying human ritual law (Lev 5:3) out of divine love. "He who was pure and undefiled was not contaminated by contact with disease." (DA 266). Jesus imparts purity; He doesn't contract impurity.
        - [Whiteboard: Leper: Unclean, Isolated | Jesus: Compassion, Power, Purity]
        - **(RQ)** What does Jesus touching the untouchable reveal about God's character versus human traditions or fears about contamination by sin? (Cf. Isaiah 59:1-2 - sin separates, but Christ bridges).
- **Immediate Physical and Spiritual Healing**
    - Luke 5:13b - "immediately the leprosy departed from him."
    - Jesus possesses absolute power over disease (physical effect of sin) and defilement (spiritual state).
    - [Brief Concept: Jesus' touch reverses the curse, foreshadowing the ultimate cleansing available through Him, symbolized in the sanctuary service.]
    - Note Jesus' instruction to follow the prescribed law (Luke 5:14) – showing respect for divine ordinance while demonstrating its deeper meaning.

### Section 2: Recognizing Our Own Leprosy [*] (10 min)
- **The Inner 'Leprosy' of Sin**
    - Transition: Physical leprosy was a visible symbol of sin's destructive, isolating nature – a separation from God and community. (Isaiah 59:2)
    - **(RQ)** While we may not have physical leprosy, what spiritual 'leprosy' – what sin – separates us from God and hinders our witness? (1 John 3:4 - Sin is lawlessness/transgression of God's law).
    - Read Matthew 5:21-22 - Jesus reveals the root of sin in the heart: anger, contempt. This is heart-leprosy, violating the spirit of the law ("Thou shalt not kill").
        - [Whiteboard: Spiritual Leprosy = Sin (Violation of God's Law - Anger, Bitterness, Pride - Matt 5:21-22; 1 John 3:4)]
    - Discuss common inner sins: selfishness, pride, envy, impurity, unforgiveness – these isolate us from God and damage relationships. They are manifestations of the carnal nature at war with God's Spirit (Romans 8:7).
    - [Aside: "Sin is the transgression of the law." (1 John 3:4). Like hidden sores, these transgressions fester unseen, poisoning our spiritual vitality. We often try to cover them up, but God sees the heart (1 Sam 16:7) and desires truth in the inward parts (Ps 51:6).]
- **Acknowledging Our Need**
    - Like the leper, we must recognize our condition and our inability to cleanse ourselves (Jeremiah 13:23; Romans 7:18). Self-righteousness is a barrier.
    - We need to come to Jesus with the same humility and faith: "Lord, *if you will*, you can make me clean." Recognizing His power and submitting to His will.
    - **(RQ)** Are we truly willing to acknowledge our specific sins and our desperate need for His cleansing touch today?

### Section 3: The Healer's Prescription: Love & Mercy in Action (10 min)
- **Following the Healed Life: Reflecting His Character**
    - Jesus doesn't just cleanse; He calls us to a new life reflecting His character, which is the essence of His law (Matthew 22:37-40).
    - **Love as the Law's Fulfillment (Matthew 5:44):** Contrast Christ's command to love enemies with the 'leprosy' of hatred/bitterness. This is the standard of the kingdom.
    - **Show Mercy (Good Samaritan - Luke 10:30-37):**
        - Briefly outline the parable: Priest/Levite (ceremonial concerns) vs. Samaritan (practical compassion). The lawyer asked "Who is my neighbor?" (v. 29). Jesus showed *how* to be a neighbor.
        - The Samaritan *touched* the wounded man, crossing social barriers, mirroring Christ's touch. This is practical godliness, the law lived out.
        - [Whiteboard: Jesus' Way: Love Enemies (Matt 5:44), Show Mercy (Luke 10:37) = Fulfilling the Law]
        - **(RQ)** How does the Good Samaritan challenge our tendency to prioritize convenience or social norms over demonstrating God's compassionate law towards those in need (spiritually or physically)?
    - **Repentance & Acceptance (Prodigal Son - Luke 15:11-24):**
        - Focus on the Father's compassionate embrace (v. 20) – mirroring God's character, His willingness to forgive and restore us when we turn from our 'sin-leprosy' in genuine repentance.
        - [Whiteboard: Repentance (Luke 15:21) -> God's Acceptance (Luke 15:20)]
        - This reflects God's longing for reconciliation, a core theme in the Great Controversy narrative.

### Section 4: The Source and Goal of Healing (5 min)
- **The Ultimate Healing: Christ's Sacrifice**
    - Read Isaiah 53:5 - "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed."
    - His suffering and death on the cross provide the *only* means for ultimate cleansing from the leprosy of sin. He took our uncleanness upon Himself.
    - [Whiteboard: Cross (Isa 53:5) = Atonement -> Ultimate Healing from Sin]
    - [Analogy: His blood is the divine 'antiseptic' applied through faith, cleansing the soul's deepest infection, as symbolized by the cleansing rites in the sanctuary (Hebrews 9:22).]
- **The Goal: Restoration of God's Image**
    - The goal of this healing is not just forgiveness, but transformation – the restoration of God's image in us (Colossians 3:10), preparing us for His kingdom.
    - Mention the Second Coming as the final eradication of sin and its effects (Revelation 21:4), the culmination of this restorative work.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)
- **Summary:** Jesus, full of divine compassion, touched the untouchable leper, healing him instantly. This demonstrates His power and willingness to touch our sin-sick souls, cleansing the inner 'leprosy' that violates God's law and separates us from Him.
- **Personal Transformation:** True healing requires acknowledging our specific sins ('leprosy'), repenting, and seeking Christ's cleansing touch through faith in His sacrifice.
- **Character Development:** The goal is sanctification – moving from our sinful nature towards Christ-like love, mercy, and obedience to God's law, empowered by His Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).
- [Aside: Just as the cleansed leper was restored to the community (Luke 5:14), Christ's touch restores us to fellowship with God and His church, preparing us for the sinless community of heaven. It's a journey from isolation by sin to inclusion through grace.]
- **Invitation:**
    - **(RQ)** What specific 'leprosy' – what sin or character defect – are you asking Jesus to touch and cleanse today by the power of His blood?
    - Invitation to come to Jesus, just as the leper did, believing "Lord, You can make me clean." (Mark 1:40). Claim His promise of cleansing (1 John 1:9).
    - Encourage practical steps this week: Identify one area of 'spiritual leprosy' (e.g., impatience, critical spirit). Pray daily for Christ's cleansing and power to reflect His character (love, mercy) in that area, drawing strength from His Word and Spirit.
