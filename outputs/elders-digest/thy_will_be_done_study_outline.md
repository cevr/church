### Introduction (5 min)

*   **Hook:** Life is a series of choices. Every day, small and large decisions shape who we become.
*   These choices have eternal consequences, presenting us with life or death, blessing or cursing (Deut 30:19).
*   The ultimate safe guide: Understanding and aligning with God's will, trusting Him rather than our own understanding (Prov 3:5-6).
*   Introduce Central Verse: Matthew 6:10b - The prayer for God's kingdom purpose to be fulfilled through us, aligning earth with heaven's perfect submission.
*   **Goal:** To explore what God's will is according to Scripture, how He helps us know it, and how choosing it transforms us.
*   [Whiteboard: Write Title & Matt 6:10b]

### Section 1: Understanding God's Will (10 min)

*   **What is God's Will?**
    *   Not arbitrary commands, but His loving purpose flowing from His character, desiring good for us (Jer 29:11; cf. 1 John 4:8).
    *   Primary Will: Our Salvation - He "desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (1 Tim 2:4).
        *   [Whiteboard: God's Will = Salvation (1 Tim 2:4)]
    *   Consequent Will: Our Sanctification - "For this is the will of God, your sanctification" (1 Thess 4:3a), meaning being set apart and becoming holy like Christ.
        *   [Whiteboard: Add: + Sanctification (1 Thess 4:3)]
*   **Freedom and Responsibility:**
    *   God created us with the capacity to choose whom we will serve (Joshua 24:15).
    *   We are responsible for our choices and their outcomes; we reap what we sow (Gal 6:7).
    *   (RQ) Why is the freedom to choose essential for a genuine love relationship with God, rather than forced compliance?
*   **Satan's Counterfeit:**
    *   Misrepresents God's character and motives, suggesting His commands are restrictive, not protective (Gen 3:1-5).
    *   Seeks to blame God for suffering caused by sin, aiming to "steal and kill and destroy" (John 10:10a).
    *   Contrast: God's will is always for *restoration* and life, plans for welfare and a future hope (Jer 29:11; John 10:10b).

### Section 2: Discerning & Choosing God's Will [*] (12 min)

*   **The Foundation for Right Choices:**
    *   God's revealed standards: His Word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path (Psalm 119:105). The Law reveals His character.
    *   Motivation: Love for God and others is the fulfillment of the law (Matt 22:37-40; Rom 13:10).
    *   (RQ) How does understanding God's law through the lens of love (Matt 22:37-40) prevent it from becoming mere legalism?
*   **How God Reveals His Will:**
    *   **Scripture:** The primary, authoritative source, profitable for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (2 Tim 3:16-17).
        *   [Whiteboard: How? -> Scripture (2 Tim 3:16)]
    *   **Providence:** God works all things together for good for those who love Him and are called according to His purpose (Rom 8:28) - *always interpreted through Scripture*.
        *   [Whiteboard: How? -> Providence (Rom 8:28)]
    *   **Holy Spirit:** The Spirit guides into all truth (John 16:13), convicts (John 16:8), and illuminates Scripture - *His leading never contradicts the written Word*.
        *   [Whiteboard: How? -> Holy Spirit (John 16:13)]
*   **Our Part: The Conditions for Knowing:**
    *   **Willingness:** "If anyone's will is to do God's will, he will know whether the teaching is from God" (John 7:17). A heart ready to obey precedes full understanding.
        *   [Whiteboard: Our Part -> Willingness (John 7:17)]
    *   **Diligent Study:** Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, rightly handling the word of truth (2 Tim 2:15); make the best use of time, understanding the Lord's will (Eph 5:15-17).
        *   [Whiteboard: Our Part -> Study (2 Tim 2:15; Eph 5:17)]
    *   **Prayer:** Ask God for wisdom, and He will give generously without reproach (James 1:5).
        *   [Whiteboard: Our Part -> Prayer (James 1:5)]
    *   **Surrender & Transformation:** Present your bodies as a living sacrifice; be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God (Romans 12:1-2).
        *   [Whiteboard: Our Part -> Surrender (Rom 12:1-2)]
    *   **Sensitivity:** Walk by the Spirit, keeping in step with the Spirit (Gal 5:25). Learn to recognize His gentle promptings.
*   [Aside: Think of Romans 12:2 like this...] Our lives, when surrendered, become like embassies of heaven on earth. We represent the culture, values, and will of our King, refusing to simply blend in or conform to the surrounding world's patterns.

### Section 3: Living God's Will: Sanctification & Character (10 min)

*   **God's Will in Practice:**
    *   Sanctification (1 Thess 4:3) involves specific, practical outworkings revealed in Scripture:
        *   Walk wisely, making the best use of time (Eph 5:15-16).
        *   Do not neglect meeting together for worship and encouragement (Heb 10:25).
        *   Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus (1 Thess 5:18).
        *   Abstain from sexual immorality; control your own body in holiness and honor (1 Thess 4:3-5).
    *   (RQ) Based on 1 Thess 4:3-7, how integral is practical, moral holiness to fulfilling God's will for our sanctification?
*   **Character Building: The Fruit of Choosing His Will:**
    *   Repeated right choices, focusing our minds on what is true, honorable, just, pure, lovely, commendable (Phil 4:8), form holy habits.
    *   These habits shape our character, transforming us into the image of the Lord from one degree of glory to another (2 Cor 3:18).
    *   [Whiteboard: Choices (Prov 3:6) -> Habits (Phil 4:8 focus) -> Character (2 Cor 3:18) -> God's Image]
    *   [Analogy: Character is like a spiritual muscle.] Faithfulness in small choices (Luke 16:10) strengthens our character, preparing us for greater tests and responsibilities. Each right choice builds spiritual 'muscle memory'.
*   **Faithfulness in Little Things:**
    *   "One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much" (Luke 16:10a). Integrity is built in the small, everyday decisions.
    *   God often uses trials and daily choices to test and refine our character, proving our faithfulness (James 1:2-4; cf. Deut 8:2).
    *   (RQ) Thinking about your daily routine, where can you consciously practice faithfulness in a 'little thing' based on God's revealed will (e.g., honesty, kindness, diligence)?
*   **The Motivation: Love, Not Coercion:**
    *   True obedience stems from love: "If you love me, you will keep my commandments" (John 14:15). It's a response to His love for us (1 John 4:19).
    *   Obedience is not a means *to earn* salvation, but the natural *evidence of* a heart changed by grace (cf. James 2:17-18).
    *   [Whiteboard: Obedience = Response to Love (John 14:15)]

### Conclusion, Action Steps & Appeal (8 min)

*   **Recap:** Life demands choices. God offers His loving will (salvation - 1 Tim 2:4; sanctification - 1 Thess 4:3) as our sure guide.
*   We discern His will primarily through Scripture (2 Tim 3:16), empowered by prayer (James 1:5), requiring a surrendered heart (Rom 12:1-2) and the Spirit's guidance (John 16:13).
*   Choosing His will daily transforms our character into His likeness (2 Cor 3:18).
*   Reiterate Central Verse: Matthew 6:10b - Let this be our daily prayer of surrender and alignment.
*   **The Core Choice:** Will we lean on our own understanding, or will we trust in the Lord with all our heart and acknowledge Him in all our ways? (Prov 3:5-6).

*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from our study):**
    1.  **Daily Surrender Prayer:** This week, begin each day by consciously praying Matthew 6:10b ("Thy will be done"), intentionally surrendering your plans and asking for His guidance, embodying the living sacrifice of Romans 12:1.
    2.  **Intentional Scripture Check:** Before making one significant decision this week (or regarding one ongoing situation), pause and intentionally ask, "What biblical principles apply here?" Look up relevant verses (using tools if needed) to actively seek His revealed will (Eph 5:17; 2 Tim 3:16).
    3.  **Practice 'Little Thing' Faithfulness:** Identify one specific, small area in your daily life (e.g., punctuality, speaking kindly under pressure, honesty in small matters) and consciously choose God's way in it each day this week, remembering Luke 16:10.

*   **Gentle Invitation:** Choose today, and every day, to surrender your will to God's loving purpose revealed in His Word. Seek His will diligently through study and prayer (2 Tim 2:15; James 1:5), trust His guidance (Prov 3:5-6), and allow Him to shape you into His image (2 Cor 3:18).
*   This path leads not only to a transformed life now, being renewed in our minds (Rom 12:2), but ultimately to an eternal destiny with Him in the place He has prepared (John 14:1-3).
