**Opening Hymn:** #602 "O Brother, Be Faithful" "O brother, be faithful! Soon
Jesus will come, For whom we have waited so long; O, soon we shall enter our
glorious home, And join in the conqueror's song."

**Closing Hymn:** #294 "Power in the Blood" "Would you be free from the burden

**Central Bible Verse:** Matthew 7:21-23 - "Not every one that saith unto me,
Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will
of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in
thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never
knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity."

### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: The ultimate question - "Will _I_ be in heaven?" Is assurance possible?
- Solemn Truth: Scripture warns that some who expect heaven will tragically miss
  it.
- Purpose: To examine _from the Bible_ why this happens and God's clear path to
  avoid this fate.
- Read Central Verse: Matthew 7:21-23.
  `[Whiteboard: Matt 7:21-23 - "Not everyone... but he that DOETH..."]`
- **RQ:** What is Jesus emphasizing here about entry into His kingdom?

### Section 1: The Sobering Reality (10 min)

- Focus: Jesus' direct warnings about the lost.
- **Matthew 7:21-23 Revisited:**
  - The Shocking Claim: Professing Christians, active in ministry ("prophesied,"
    "cast out devils," "wonderful works").
  - The Devastating Verdict: "I never _knew_ you... depart from me, ye that work
    _iniquity_."
    `[Whiteboard: Claimed Works vs. Knowing Jesus & Forsaking Iniquity]`
  - **RQ:** What does it mean to "know" Jesus in a saving way, beyond just
    knowing _about_ Him? (cf. 1 John 2:3-4)
  - Key: Doing the Father's will, not just religious activity.
- **Matthew 7:13-14: The Two Ways**
  - Wide Gate/Broad Way: Easy, popular, leads to destruction. Many go there.
  - Narrow Gate/Difficult Way: Requires effort, self-denial, leads to life. Few
    find it.
    `[Whiteboard: Draw two paths: Wide/Easy/Many -> Destruction vs. Narrow/Difficult/Few -> Life]`
  - **RQ:** Why is the way to life described as "difficult" and found by "few"?
  - Implication: Following the crowd is spiritually dangerous.

### Section 2: Why Some Miss Out [*] (12 min)

- Focus: The fundamental barriers revealed in Scripture.
- **Isaiah 59:1-2: Sin, the Great Separator**
  - God's power/willingness is not the issue.
  - "Your iniquities have separated between you and your God... your sins have
    hid his face from you." `[Whiteboard: SIN (Isa 59:2) = SEPARATION]`
  - **RQ:** How does unconfessed, cherished sin prevent us from truly "knowing"
    God (Matt 7:23)?
  - Practical: Sin grieves the Spirit and cuts off divine connection.
- **James 4:6: Pride, the Resistor of Grace**
  - "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble."
    `[Whiteboard: Pride (Resisted) vs. Humility (Grace Given) - James 4:6]`
  - Pride = Self-sufficiency, trusting own merits/understanding, resisting God's
    terms.
  - **RQ:** Can someone claim "Lord, Lord" (Matt 7:21) yet still be operating in
    pride, resisting full submission?
  - [Aside: *"Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture."* - Implies
    needing God's standard (humility), not cultural ease (pride).]
- **Character Transformation Required:**
  - Briefly reference EGW concept (_Christian Education_, p. 109, 237): Heaven
    is a prepared place for a prepared people. Purity, holiness, Christ-like
    character are prerequisites, developed through grace here.
  - Connection: Sin (Isa 59:2) and Pride (James 4:6) are incompatible with the
    character needed for heaven.

### Section 3: God's Required Path (12 min)

- Focus: The non-negotiable conditions for salvation outlined in God's Word.
- **Hebrews 5:8-9: Obedience - The Fruit of Saving Faith**
  - Though He was a Son, Jesus learned obedience.
  - He became the author of eternal salvation "unto all them that _obey_ him."
    `[Whiteboard: OBEDIENCE (Heb 5:9) -> Evidence of Salvation]`
  - Not earning salvation, but demonstrating the reality of relationship and
    submission to Christ's lordship.
- **Revelation 22:14: The Blessing on Doing**
  - "Blessed are they that _do his commandments_, that they may have right to
    the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city."
    `[Whiteboard: Commandments (Rev 22:14) -> Access to Heaven]`
  - Connects obedience directly to God's revealed will (His law) and eternal
    life.
- **The Scriptural Steps to Life (God's Terms):**
  `[Whiteboard: God's Path to Life]`
  - 1.  **Faith:** Believing _in_ Jesus as Lord & Savior (John 8:24 - "if ye
        believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins").
        `[Add: Faith (John 8:24)]`
  - 2.  **Repentance:** Turning _away_ from sin (Luke 13:3 - "except ye repent,
        ye shall all likewise perish"). `[Add: Repentance (Luke 13:3)]`
  - 3.  **Confession:** Acknowledging Christ _before others_ (Matt 10:32-33 -
        "Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men...").
        `[Add: Confession (Matt 10:32)]`
  - 4.  **Baptism:** Immersion as commanded, symbolizing death to sin & new life
        (Mark 16:16 - "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved...").
        `[Add: Baptism (Mark 16:16)]`
  - 5.  **Faithfulness:** Continuing in obedience and faith _to the end_ (Rev
        2:10 - "be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of
        life"). `[Add: Faithfulness (Rev 2:10)]`
  - **RQ:** Looking at these verses, are these steps optional add-ons, or
    integral parts of God's plan for receiving and maintaining salvation?
  - [Analogy (from Heb 5:8-9): Obedience like breathing - not what *makes* you
    alive, but the undeniable evidence *that* you are alive in Christ.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Missing heaven is a real, eternal tragedy (Matt 7:21-23). Sin separates
  (Isa 59:1-2), pride resists grace (James 4:6). But God has provided a clear
  path through obedience born of faith (Heb 5:8-9, Rev 22:14).
- **Urgency: The Time is NOW!**
  - Read 2 Corinthians 6:2: "Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is
    the day of salvation." `[Whiteboard: NOW! (2 Cor 6:2)]`
  - Warning: Procrastination is Satan's tool. We don't know when our probation
    closes.
  - [Aside: *"Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to
    demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others... even though it came
    from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December
    offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed."* -
    Connects urgency to using every opportunity *now*.]
- **Personal Plea:**
  - Don't gamble with eternity. Don't assume you are safe based on feelings or
    past experiences alone.
  - Examine yourself: Are you truly _doing_ the Father's will? Are you walking
    the narrow way?
  - **RQ:** Will you hear "Well done, good and faithful servant," or the
    dreadful words, "I never knew you"?
- **Invitation:**
  - Choose today: Humble yourself (James 4:6).
  - Choose today: Repent and forsake sin through Christ's power (Isa 59:1-2;
    Luke 13:3).
  - Choose today: Embrace God's full path - Faith, Repentance, Confession,
    Baptism, and ongoing Faithfulness (John 8:24, Matt 10:32, Mark 16:16, Rev
    2:10).
  - Make your calling and election sure (2 Peter 1:10). Don't miss heaven!
