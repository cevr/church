-   [Whiteboard: Key Tension: God's Universal Compassion vs. Human Reluctance]

### Section 1: The Call, The Flight, The Storm (10 min)
-   **God's Clear, Uncomfortable Call (Jonah 1:1-2)**
    -   Command: "Arise, go to Nineveh..."
    -   Context: Nineveh = capital of Assyria, Israel's cruel enemy.
    -   Point: God's mission extends beyond our comfort zones and perceived enemies.
    -   [Whiteboard: God's Call -> Nineveh (Enemy Territory)]
    -   **(RQ)** Why would God send His prophet there?
-   **Jonah's Deliberate Disobedience (Jonah 1:3)**
    -   Action: Fled to Tarshish - the opposite direction.
    -   Motive: Fear? Prejudice? Nationalism? (Implied, revealed later in Ch 4).
    -   Point: Personal feelings/prejudices must not override God's explicit command.
    -   [Whiteboard: Jonah's Choice -> Tarshish (Opposite Direction) = Disobedience]
-   **Consequences Ripple Outward (Jonah 1:4-6)**
    -   The Storm: God intervenes.
    -   Impact: Innocent sailors endangered by Jonah's sin.
    -   Point: Running from God's will causes internal conflict and external harm.
    -   [Whiteboard: Disobedience -> Storm -> Danger for Others]
-   **Inconsistency Exposed (Jonah 1:7-12)**
    -   The Discovery: Lots reveal Jonah as the cause.
    -   The Confession: "I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD..." (Jonah 1:9) - yet he fled.
    -   Point: Even unbelievers can recognize the inconsistency between professed faith and willful disobedience.
    -   **(RQ)** How often does our lifestyle contradict our stated beliefs? (Jonah 1:10)
    -   Jonah suggests being thrown overboard (Jonah 1:12) - taking responsibility, yet still avoiding Nineveh?

### Section 2: Consequences & God's Pursuit (12 min) [*]
-   **The Cost of Running (Jonah 1:13-16)**
    -   Sailors try human effort first, then reluctantly obey Jonah/God.
    -   Point: Sin and separation from God are costly and lead to desperate situations.
-   **God's Unexpected Provision (Jonah 1:17)**
    -   The Great Fish: Not just punishment, but preservation and redirection.
    -   Point: God, in His grace, persistently pursues His reluctant servants, using consequences to bring them back.
    -   [Analogy (from Jonah 1:17): God's discipline like a loving parent's 'time out' - designed for reflection and return, not final rejection.]
-   **Prayer from the Depths (Jonah 2:1-9)**
    -   Setting: Belly of the fish - rock bottom.
    -   Content: Acknowledges God's sovereignty, cries for help, vows obedience (again).
    -   Key Insight: "Salvation is of the LORD." (Jonah 2:9)
    -   Point: True solutions lie not in human effort, but in returning to God.
    -   [Whiteboard: Depths (Jonah 2:2) -> Prayer -> Acknowledging God (Jonah 2:9)]
-   **Deliverance (Jonah 2:10)**
    -   God commands the fish; Jonah gets a second chance on dry land.

### Section 3: Reluctant Obedience & God's Lesson (12 min)
-   **The Second Call (Jonah 3:1-3)**
    -   God's grace: The same command is given again.
    -   Jonah's response: He went... but was his heart changed?
    -   Point: God offers opportunities for repentance and renewed obedience.
-   **Minimal Message, Maximum Impact (Jonah 3:4-10)**
    -   The Sermon: "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown." (Jonah 3:4) - Brief, seemingly harsh.
    -   The Response: City-wide repentance, from king down.
    -   God's Response: He relented from the disaster (Jonah 3:10).
    -   Point: God's power works through yielded (even reluctantly yielded) instruments; the results belong to Him.
    -   **(RQ)** Did Jonah preach hoping for repentance or destruction?
-   **Jonah's Anger Revealed (Jonah 4:1-4)**
    -   Reaction: "It displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry." (Jonah 4:1)
    -   Reason: Angry that God showed mercy to Nineveh! (Jonah 4:2) - His prejudice confirmed.
    -   Point: Lack of compassion and personal prejudice (even 'religious' prejudice) are directly opposed to God's character.
    -   [Whiteboard: Jonah's Anger (4:1) <<<>>> God's Compassion (3:10)]
    -   God's Question: "Doest thou well to be angry?" (Jonah 4:4) **(RQ)**
-   **God's Object Lesson: The Gourd and the Worm (Jonah 4:5-11)**
    -   Jonah waits, hoping for destruction.
    -   God provides comfort (gourd), then removes it (worm, sun).
    -   Jonah's pity for the plant vs. lack of pity for 120,000+ people.
    -   [Aside: Sometimes God uses uncomfortable circumstances, like the heat and the worm, to expose our own selfishness and teach us His perspective, much like He did with Jonah. Our reaction to small losses can reveal our misplaced values.]
    -   Point: God values souls infinitely more than our temporary comforts or prejudices.
    -   [Whiteboard: God's Question (4:11) -> Value of Souls > Personal Comfort/Prejudice]
    -   Point: Genuine evangelism requires reflecting God's own love and compassion.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   **Summary of Lessons:**
    -   God's mission is universal; His compassion knows no bounds.
    -   Disobedience born of prejudice or fear is costly and inconsistent with faith.
    -   God pursues us relentlessly with grace, even through consequences.
    -   True obedience involves aligning our hearts, not just our actions, with God's compassionate will.
-   **Practical Application & Self-Examination:**
    -   **Examine Motives:** Do we serve God willingly, reflecting His love, or reluctantly like Jonah? **(RQ)**
    -   **Embrace Universality:** Do we harbor prejudices against certain groups God calls us to reach? [Whiteboard: Action -> Examine Prejudices]
    -   **Heed God's Will:** Are we running from a clear command like Jonah? Return to His path. [Whiteboard: Action -> Choose Obedience]
    -   **Cultivate Compassion:** Ask God to replace anger/indifference with His heart for the lost (Jonah 4:11). [Whiteboard: Action -> Pray for Compassion]
-   **Final Invitation:** Let the story of Jonah challenge us to confront our own reluctance and prejudice. Let us ask God to shape our characters to reflect His boundless compassion, becoming willing and joyful participants in His mission to seek and save *all* who are lost.
