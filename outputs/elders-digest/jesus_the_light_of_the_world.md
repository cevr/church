### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with the universal experience of light vs. darkness (physical).
  - Dependence on the sun for physical life, warmth, sight.
- Transition: Is there a greater light? A spiritual light?
  - ** (RQ)** What does spiritual 'darkness' represent in the Bible? (Ignorance,
    sin, separation from God - Isa 9:2)
- Introduce Jesus' bold claim: "I am the light of the world." (John 8:12)
  - `[Whiteboard: John 8:12 - "I AM the Light of the World"]`
- Thesis: Jesus Christ is the true, essential Light, superior to the sun,
  bringing spiritual life, truth, and transformation.

### Section 1: Jesus, The Source of Light (10 min)

- **Jesus as the Origin of Life and Light:**
  - Explore John 1:4-5 - "In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
    And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not."
    - `[Whiteboard: John 1:4 - LIFE = LIGHT]`
    - Life _in_ Him _is_ the light. Not just reflects light, He _is_ the source.
    - Darkness cannot extinguish this light. **(RQ)** What does this tell us
      about the power of Christ's truth against error?
  - Explore John 1:9 - "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that
    cometh into the world."
    - Universal provision of light (conscience, nature, Word) - Rom 1:19-20.
    - Jesus is the ultimate, genuine source compared to lesser lights.
- **Jesus Reveals God's Character:**
  - His life, teachings, sacrifice demonstrate God's goodness, love, and justice
    (John 14:9 - "he that hath seen me hath seen the Father").
  - `[Analogy (from John 1:4): Jesus' life like a lamp showing us the Father's heart in a dark room.]`
  - Contrast with distorted views of God common in the world.

### Section 2: Light Reveals & Repels [*] (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Why isn't everyone drawn to this wonderful Light?
  **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (John 3:19-21):**
  - Read John 3:19-21 - "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into
    the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds
    were evil..."
  - `[Whiteboard: John 3:19 - Loved Darkness > Light (Reason: Evil Deeds)]`
  - Light exposes sin. It makes uncomfortable those who cherish evil.
  - **(RQ)** How does light reveal truth about _ourselves_? (Shows flaws,
    selfishness, need - like a mirror).
  - This rejection isn't ignorance, but a _choice_ based on love for sin.
- **Bridging to Practice:**
  - Modern examples: Resisting biblical counsel, avoiding conviction,
    rationalizing sin.
  - `[Aside: Sometimes the hardest truths to accept are the ones that expose something we don't want to let go of. The Light challenges our comfort zones, but that's where real change begins.]`
- **Light Reveals the Savior & Salvation:**
  - While exposing sin, the Light also reveals the remedy: Christ Himself.
  - John 14:6 - "I am the way, the truth, and the life..."
  - `[Whiteboard: Light Reveals: 1. Our Sin (Need) 2. Christ (Savior) 3. The Way (Salvation - John 14:6)]`
  - Receiving Jesus = Receiving eternal life (John 3:16, John 1:12).

### Section 3: Light Transforms & Assures (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** What happens when someone _accepts_ the Light? **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle (1 John 1:5-7):**
  - Read 1 John 1:5-7 - "God is light... if we walk in the light, as he is in
    the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus
    Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin."
  - `[Whiteboard: 1 John 1:7 - Walk in Light -> Fellowship + Cleansing]`
  - Walking in the light = Living in conscious alignment with God's revealed
    truth (Jesus).
  - This leads to spiritual growth, character development (fruit of the Spirit -
    Gal 5:22-23).
  - `[Metaphor (from 1 John 1:7): Walking in light like a plant turning to the sun - leads to growth and fruit.]`
- **Bridging to Practice:**
  - Daily choices: Choosing honesty, integrity, kindness based on biblical
    principles.
  - Consistent Bible study and prayer keeps us 'walking in the light'.
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from 1 John 1:7):**
  1.  **Confess known sin:** Acknowledge where you've walked in darkness (1 John
      1:9).
  2.  **Choose obedience:** Intentionally align actions with God's Word today.
  3.  **Seek fellowship:** Connect with other believers walking in the light.
- **Light Provides Assurance & Peace:**
  - Darkness = uncertainty, fear. Light = clarity, security.
  - Knowing sins are forgiven (cleansed by blood) brings peace (Rom 5:1).
  - Understanding God's plan provides security and hope (John 14:1-3).
  - `[Whiteboard: Light Brings: Growth, Fellowship, Cleansing, Peace, Security]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Jesus _is_ the Light of the World (John 8:12). He reveals God,
  exposes sin, offers salvation, transforms character, and gives assurance.
- **Invitation to Receive:** Have you personally stepped out of darkness into
  His marvelous light? (1 Peter 2:9). Invitation to accept Christ.
- **The Believer's Role (Matthew 5:14-16):**
  - Read Matt 5:14-16 - "Ye are the light of the world... Let your light so
    shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father
    which is in heaven."
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 5:14 - YOU are the light (Reflecting Jesus)]`
  - We don't generate light; we _reflect_ Christ's light.
  - `[Aside: Our lives are like mirrors. If they are clean and turned towards the Son (Jesus), they will reflect His light brightly to a dark world. Smudges of sin or turning away dims the reflection.]`
  - Good works aren't the source of salvation, but the _evidence_ of it,
    pointing others to God.
- **Call to Action: Shine!**
  - How can we let our light shine this week? (Kindness, integrity, sharing
    hope).
  - The church's collective witness: A city on a hill.
  - Final emphasis: Tell the good news! Carry the Light! Be intentional
    witnesses.
- **Closing Prayer:** Pray for acceptance of the Light and boldness to reflect
  it.
