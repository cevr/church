### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: The common gap between what we _say_ we believe and what we _do_.
- Introduce Jesus' Parable of the Two Sons (Matthew 21).
- Central Question: What does God truly value – our promises or our performance?
- Briefly note the context: Jesus confronting religious leaders who professed
  righteousness but rejected His authority.

- [Write on board: Central Verse Ref: Matt 21:31b]

### Section 1: The Parable and Its Setting (12 min)

- Read Matthew 21:28-31a.
- **The Father's Command:** "Go, work today in my vineyard." (v. 28)
  - God's universal call to participate in His work; practical service.
  - [Write on board: Command = WORK (Matt 21:28)]
- **Son 1: The Repentant Doer:** "I will not," but afterward he repented
  (_metamelomai_ - regretted/changed mind) and went. (v. 29)
  - Initial refusal, honest but wrong.
  - Action followed change of heart. True repentance leads to obedience.
  - [Write: Son 1: No -> YES (Action)]
  - (RQ) Can initial reluctance give way to willing obedience through God's
    prompting?
- **Son 2: The Empty Professor:** "I go, sir," but went not. (v. 30)
  - Outward respect, verbal agreement.
  - Inward disobedience, lack of action. Represents profession without practice.
  - [Write: Son 2: YES -> NO (Action)]
  - [Analogy: Signing a membership form but never participating in the mission.]
- **Jesus' Pointed Question:** "Whether of them twain did the will of his
  father?" (v. 31a)
  - Forces listeners (and us) to evaluate based on _action_, not words.
  - The answer is clear: the one who _did_ the work.
  - (RQ) Why did Jesus use this simple story to confront the learned religious
    leaders?
- **The Confrontational Context:** (Matt 21:31b-32)
  - Spoken to chief priests/elders questioning His authority (v. 23).
  - They represented Son 2: Professed loyalty to God but rejected His messengers
    (John the Baptist, Jesus).
  - John's call: "Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance." (Matt 3:8)
  - [Write: Context = Religious Leaders (Professors) vs. Repentant Sinners
    (Doers)]

### Section 2: Deeds Speak Louder Than Words (13 min) [*]

- **The Core Principle:** God prioritizes genuine obedience over empty
  profession. (Matt 21:31)
  - [Write on board: God Values: Deeds > Words (Matt 21:31)]
  - Reference EGW: COL 275-276 (Profession worthless without practice).
- **James on Practical Religion:** (James 1:26-27)
  - Read James 1:26-27.
  - Vain religion: Unbridled tongue (words without control/action) (v. 26).
  - Pure religion: Active compassion ("visit fatherless/widows") + Personal
    holiness ("keep unspotted") (v. 27).
  - [Write: James 1:27 = Pure Religion = Action + Holiness]
  - (RQ) How does our weekly schedule reflect the priorities of James 1:27?
- **The Danger of Hearing Only:** (James 1:22)
  - Self-deception results from hearing truth without doing it.
  - Leads to hypocrisy (appearing godly, denying power - 2 Tim 3:5).
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]
- **Why Actions Matter:**
  - Reveal the true heart condition (Matt 7:17 - fruit shows the tree).
  - Evidence of genuine faith and repentance.
  - Connects to character development needed for God's kingdom.
  - (RQ) If someone only observed our actions for a week, would they see
    evidence of genuine faith?

### Section 3: True Repentance and Willing Obedience (10 min)

- **Repentance Means Change:** (Son 1 - Matt 21:29)
  - _Metanoeo_ (implied change leading to action) - More than sorrow; a change
    of mind, purpose, direction leading to obedience.
  - Reference EGW: COL 272 (True repentance shown by obedience).
  - [Write: True Repentance = Changed Mind -> Changed Action]
- **The Goal: Doing God's Will:**
  - Psalm 40:8 - "I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
    heart."
    - Christ's example; the desire implanted by grace.
  - 1 John 2:17 - "But he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."
    - Obedience linked to eternal life.
  - [Write: Goal = DO God's Will (Ps 40:8; 1 John 2:17)]
  - (RQ) What does it mean for God's law to be _within the heart_ versus just in
    a rulebook?
- **Holiness is Surrender Leading to Action:**
  - Defined as surrender and obedience, trusting God's power. (Ref AA 51).
  - Not self-effort, but Christ working in us.
  - [Metaphor: Like electricity flowing through a wire - connection
    (faith/surrender) enables power for action (obedience).]
  - [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to
    demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others... even though it came
    from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom...]
- **Practical Steps (Derived from Texts):**
  - **1. Honest Self-Examination:** Compare your 'I go, sir' moments with actual
    follow-through. (Ref James 1:22-25)
  - **2. Seek True Repentance:** Ask God for a change of mind and heart where
    needed (like Son 1). Rely on His strength, not willpower alone.
  - **3. Choose Action:** Identify one specific way this week to 'work in the
    vineyard' – fulfill a known duty, serve someone practically. (Ref James
    1:27, Matt 25:31-40)
  - [Write on board: Action Steps: 1. Examine (Jas 1:22) 2. Repent (Matt 21:29)
    3. Act (Jas 1:27)]

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: Jesus' parable forces a choice – will we be defined by our words or our
  deeds?
- God values the repentant heart that leads to action (Son 1) far above the
  empty promise (Son 2).
- The shocking truth: Those seen as 'sinners' who repented and obeyed were
  closer to the kingdom than the outwardly religious who refused God's will
  (Matt 21:31b-32).
- Invitation: Examine your own life. Are you saying 'yes' but doing 'no'? Or are
  you, perhaps after initial reluctance, choosing to _do_ the Father's will?
- Appeal: Commit today to be a 'doer of the word'. Ask God for the grace to make
  your actions align with your profession of faith.
- Closing Prayer: For forgiveness for empty promises, and for strength and
  willingness to actively 'work in the vineyard' today.
