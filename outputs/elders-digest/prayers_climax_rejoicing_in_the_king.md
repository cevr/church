### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Opening Prayer
- The Familiar Ending: How often do we rush past the final words of the Lord's
  Prayer? (Matthew 6:13b)
- Beyond a Formula: This isn't just an ending; it's a profound declaration of
  praise and confidence.
- Focus: Unpacking the joy and assurance found in acknowledging God's eternal
  kingdom, power, and glory as the climax of prayer.
- [Write on board: Matt 6:13b - Kingdom | Power | Glory | Forever | Amen]

### Section 1: Rejoice in God's Kingdom (Pre-eminence) (8 min)

- **The Need/Question:** In a chaotic world, where is ultimate control? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** God's Absolute Sovereignty - "Thine is the
  _kingdom_..."
  - He reigns supreme, His purpose stands. (Isaiah 46:10-11)
  - No one can thwart His hand or question His authority. (Isaiah 43:13; Daniel
    4:35)
  - [Whiteboard: KINGDOM = God's Sovereign Rule & Unstoppable Purpose (Isa
    46:10-11)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Knowing God is ultimately in control provides peace
  amidst uncertainty.
  - (RQ) How does recognizing God's absolute sovereignty change how we view
    world events or personal trials?
- **Actionable Step:** Intentionally acknowledge God's supreme authority in your
  prayers, especially when feeling overwhelmed.

### Section 2: Rejoice in God's Power (Almighty & Unchanging) (8 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Do we doubt God's ability to answer or intervene?
  **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** God's Infinite & Immutable Power - "...and the
  _power_..."
  - Enormous Creative Power: Nothing is too hard for Him. (Jeremiah 32:17 - "Ah
    Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great
    power...")
  - Eternal & Unchanging Nature: His power doesn't diminish. (Malachi 3:6 - "I
    am the Lord, I change not"; Hebrews 13:8 - "Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
    and to day, and for ever.")
  - [Whiteboard: POWER = Almighty (Jer 32:17) + Unchanging (Mal 3:6)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** This gives unshakable confidence when we approach
  Him.
  - [Aside: "It's like a child holding their father's strong hand in a storm. We
    don't rely on our own strength, but on His unchanging, almighty grip. That's
    the confidence prayer offers."]
  - (RQ) Do our prayers reflect a genuine belief in _this_ level of power?
- **Actionable Step:** When praying about difficult situations, specifically
  recall and state God's limitless and unchanging power (citing verses like Jer
  32:17).

### Section 3: Rejoice in God's Glory (Character & Purpose) (7 min)

- **The Need/Question:** What is the ultimate purpose behind everything?
  **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** God's Unique & Excellent Glory - "...and the
  _glory_..."
  - His Name (Character) is Excellent: He alone deserves worship and praise.
    (Psalm 8:1 - "O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
    who hast set thy glory above the heavens.")
  - All He Does is For His Glory: His ultimate aim is the revelation of His
    perfect character. (Isaiah 48:11)
  - He is Jealous for His Glory: He will not share His rightful praise with
    idols or human pride. (Isaiah 42:8)
  - [Whiteboard: GLORY = God's Excellent Character Revealed & Honored (Ps 8:1;
    Isa 42:8)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Shifts our focus from self-centered requests to
  God-centered adoration.
  - [Illustration Concept (from Ps 8:1): Like sunlight revealing dust we didn't
    see, God's glory reveals our need, but more importantly, His own
    breathtaking beauty and worthiness.]
  - (RQ) How can we ensure our prayers, even our requests, ultimately aim to
    glorify God?
- **Actionable Step:** Conclude prayers by consciously praising God _for who He
  is_ (His attributes revealed in Scripture), aiming to honor His name above
  all.

### Section 4: Our Place in His Plan (Inheritance & Access) [*] (5 min)

- **The Need/Question:** How can finite humans claim connection to this infinite
  God? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** Access & Inheritance Through Christ by Grace.
  - Believers are Children & Heirs: We share in His kingdom, power, and glory
    through Christ. (Romans 8:17 - "And if children, then heirs; heirs of God,
    and joint-heirs with Christ...")
  - Access is Solely Through Christ: He is the _only_ way to this relationship.
    (John 14:6; Acts 4:12)
  - God Determines Who Enters: Entrance is based on a grace relationship, not
    merit. [Whiteboard: Inheritance (Rom 8:17) -> Through Christ Alone (John
    14:6)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** This truth fuels humble boldness and deep gratitude
  in prayer.
  - [Aside: "Our churches should be like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory
    representing the kingdom of heaven. Our lives, through Christ, grant us
    'citizenship,' allowing us to approach the throne with the confidence of
    heirs (Rom 8:17), not beggars."]
- **Actionable Step:** Thank God specifically for the gift of access and
  inheritance made possible only through Jesus Christ.

### Section 5: Affirmation & Prophetic Echo ('Amen' & Last Days) (5 min)

- **The Need/Question:** How do we seal these truths in our hearts and connect
  them to God's ultimate plan? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** 'Amen' - The Solemn Affirmation.
  - Meaning: "So be it," "Let it stand," "Truly." It affirms everything just
    declared about God's kingdom, power, and glory. [Whiteboard: AMEN = So Be
    It! (Affirming His Kingdom, Power, Glory)]
- **Prophetic Connection:** This declaration echoes the final victory and
  establishment of God's eternal kingdom.
  - The Kingdoms Become Christ's: (Revelation 11:15 - "...The kingdoms of this
    world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall
    reign for ever and ever.")
  - The Call to Give Glory: Connects to the First Angel's Message. (Revelation
    14:7 - "...Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is
    come...")
- **Bridging to Practice:** Saying 'Amen' becomes a conscious act of faith,
  aligning our hearts with God's eternal reality and prophetic fulfillment.
- **Actionable Step:** Say 'Amen' thoughtfully, meaning it as a declaration of
  faith in God's ultimate triumph and sovereignty.

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

  powerful crescendo of praise, affirming God's eternal **Kingdom** (His
