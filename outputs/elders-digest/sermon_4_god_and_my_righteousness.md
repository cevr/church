### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** The deep human need for acceptance, to be 'good enough'. Where does this come from? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce Righteousness: God's perfect standard vs. human attempts.
    -   Briefly mention God's absolute holiness (Ref: Isa 6:3).
-   **Study Purpose:** To explore the biblical answer to how sinful humans can be right with a holy God – not by earning, but by receiving.
-   **Introduce Central Verse:** The core of the solution lies in a divine exchange (2 Cor 5:21).
    -   [Write on board: 2 Corinthians 5:21]

### Section 1: The Problem - Our Condition & God's Standard (10 min)

-   **God's Unwavering Standard:** His nature is perfectly righteous and holy (Hab 1:13 - cannot look on wickedness).
-   **Humanity's Universal State:**
    -   Read Romans 3:23. [Whiteboard: Rom 3:23 - "All have sinned..."]
    -   Emphasize universality – no exceptions based on effort or background.
-   **The Value of Human Efforts:**
    -   Read Isaiah 64:6. [Whiteboard: Isa 64:6 - Our Righteousness = "Filthy Rags"]
    -   Explain "filthy rags": Not just imperfect, but utterly unacceptable, polluted attempts to achieve righteousness before God.
    -   **(RQ)** If our very best efforts are like filthy rags, what hope do we have based on ourselves?
    -   Connect: This highlights the gap between God's standard and our reality.

### Section 2: God's Solution - The Great Exchange [*] (12 min)

-   **Introducing Justification:** God's act of *declaring* a sinner righteous.
    -   [Write on board: Justification = Declared Righteous (Not *Made* Righteous Initially)]
-   **The Core Truth - Unpacking 2 Cor 5:21:**
    -   [Whiteboard: 2 Cor 5:21 -> He became sin FOR US]
    -   "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us..." - Explain Christ's sinless nature and His substitutionary role. He took our legal standing as sinners.
    -   [Whiteboard: 2 Cor 5:21 -> ...that WE might become the righteousness of God IN HIM]
    -   "...that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." - Explain imputed righteousness. We receive His perfect standing before God.
    -   **(RQ)** What does it mean that this righteousness is found *'in Him'*?
-   **Righteousness Apart from Law-Keeping:**
    -   Read Romans 3:21-24. [Whiteboard: Rom 3:21-24 -> Righteousness APART from law, through FAITH]
    -   Explain: This righteousness comes from God, is revealed now, and is accessed through faith in Jesus, not by trying to perfectly keep the law (which Rom 3:23 showed is impossible).
-   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our lives, clothed in Christ's righteousness, should represent the Kingdom of Heaven, showing a different standard than the world's self-righteousness or despair.

### Section 3: Receiving the Gift - Faith and Its Fruit (12 min)

-   **Righteousness is a GIFT:**
    -   Read Ephesians 2:8-9. [Whiteboard: Eph 2:8-9 -> Saved by GRACE through FAITH = GIFT]
    -   Emphasize: "Not of works, lest anyone should boast." It cannot be earned or merited.
    -   **(RQ)** Why is it essential for our assurance that salvation and righteousness are gifts?
-   **Faith is the Means, Not the Cause:**
    -   Read Philippians 3:9. [Whiteboard: Phil 3:9 -> Found IN HIM, Righteousness BY FAITH]
    -   Explain Paul's desire: To be found *in Christ*, possessing God's righteousness which comes *through faith*.
    -   Define Faith: More than intellectual agreement; it's trust, reliance, dependence on Christ and His work.
    -   [Analogy (from verse): Faith is like reaching out an empty, undeserving hand to receive the priceless gift God offers.]
-   **The Result of Relationship (Briefly):**
    -   Acknowledge Ephesians 2:10: We are created *for* good works, which God prepared beforehand.
    -   Clarify: These works are the *fruit* and *evidence* of genuine faith and relationship, not the *root* or *means* of justification.
    -   [Brief Illustration Concept (from verse): Like wearing a royal robe given by the King (Christ's righteousness) - it doesn't just cover you, it changes how you see yourself and motivates you to live in a way worthy of the King, but it's the robe itself that grants you access and acceptance.]
    -   **(RQ)** How does understanding justification as a free gift change our motivation for obedience and service?

### Conclusion (6 min)

-   **Recap Core Truths:**
    -   Our own righteousness falls short (Isa 64:6).
    -   God provided perfect righteousness through Christ's sacrifice (2 Cor 5:21).
    -   This righteousness is received solely through faith as a gift (Eph 2:8-9, Phil 3:9).
-   **The Simplicity of the Gospel:** It's not about *our* striving, but *His* provision. It's about trusting His work *for* us.
    -   [Write on board: TRUST His Work FOR You]
-   **Practical Takeaway:** How do we live this out daily?
    -   Morning prayer: Acknowledge personal need/sinfulness, consciously accept and thank God for the gift of Christ's righteousness by faith.
    -   Throughout the day: When tempted or failing, flee back to the cross and the gift, not to self-condemnation or self-justification.
-   **Invitation:** Cease striving in your own strength. Accept the beautiful exchange God offers. Rest in the finished work of Christ. Choose today to be clothed in His righteousness through faith.
