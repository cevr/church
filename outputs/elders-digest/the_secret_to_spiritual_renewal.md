### Introduction (5 min)

*   Hook: Common desire for change, renewal, a fresh start. New Year's resolutions, etc.
*   **(RQ)** Why do our best efforts at self-improvement often fall short?
*   Introduce the 'secret': Not trying harder in our own strength, but complete surrender to God's power.
*   Objective: To understand from Scripture how true spiritual renewal happens through total consecration.
*   Central Verse: Romans 12:1 - The Foundation. `[Write Rom 12:1 on board]`

### Section 1: The Divine Invitation (Romans 12:1) (10 min)

*   **Focus Text:** Romans 12:1
*   **Unpacking the Invitation:**
    *   "I beseech you... by the mercies of God": Motivation is God's love, grace, sacrifice (Eph 2:4-5), not just duty. `[Whiteboard: Basis = God's Mercy (Eph 2:4-5)]`
    *   "Present your bodies": A definite, decisive, willful act. Requires conscious choice. `[Whiteboard: Present = Willful Act]`
        *   Not just abstract 'heart' but the *whole* being – physical, mental, emotional faculties.
        *   Connect to 1 Thess 5:23: "whole spirit and soul and body". `[Add 1 Thess 5:23 to board]` - God wants *all* of us.
    *   "A living sacrifice": Contrast OT dead sacrifices. This is ongoing, daily, active yielding while alive. `[Whiteboard: Living Sacrifice = Active, Daily Yielding]`
    *   "Holy, acceptable": Made possible only through Christ (Heb 10:10, 14). Not our own merit.
    *   "Reasonable service": The only logical response to God's overwhelming mercy. **(RQ)** Considering His sacrifice, is yielding *everything* truly unreasonable?

### Section 2: The Inner Conflict & Divine Power (Gal 5) [*] (12 min)

*   **Focus Text:** Galatians 5:16-17 - "Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh..."
*   The Reality: Two Natures at War Within. `[Whiteboard: Flesh <-vs-> Spirit (Gal 5:17)]`
    *   Acknowledge the struggle is real for believers (Rom 7:18-19).
    *   **(RQ)** Why doesn't conversion eliminate this conflict instantly? (Reveals need, develops dependence, builds character through choice).
*   Human Inability: "Cannot do the things that ye would" (Gal 5:17). Self-effort is futile against the flesh.
*   The Divine Solution: "Walk in the Spirit" (Gal 5:16). Requires moment-by-moment dependence and yielding control to the Holy Spirit.
*   Need for Divine Power: Human effort insufficient. `[Quote concept: EGW - Need for power outside ourselves - Ref *God's Amazing Grace*, p. 250]`
*   Transformation Process: Connect to Eph 4:22-24 - Putting off the old, being renewed in the mind, putting on the new. This is the *result* of yielding to the Spirit. `[Whiteboard: Eph 4:22-24 -> Result of Yielding]`
*   [Aside: *"Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Similarly, our bodies, yielded to God, become embassies of His kingdom in our daily lives."*]

### Section 3: Practical Consecration - Building Your Altar (12 min)

*   **Focus:** How to practically "present your bodies" (Rom 12:1).
*   Yielding Our 'Members' (Faculties): Applying surrender to specific parts of life (Ref Rom 6:13, 19). `[Whiteboard: Yielding Members (Rom 6:13)]`
    *   **Eyes:** What we look at, read, watch. **(RQ)** Does visual intake align with Phil 4:8?
    *   **Ears:** Music, conversations, media we listen to.
    *   **Mind:** Thoughts, attitudes, imaginations. (Ref 2 Cor 10:5 - Bringing thoughts captive to Christ). `[Write 2 Cor 10:5 on board]`
    *   **Mouth:** Speech, tone, what we communicate.
    *   **Hands/Feet:** Actions, service, places we go.
    *   **Will:** The crucial governing power. The point of decision. `[Quote concept: EGW - The will as the governing power - Ref *Testimonies*, Vol 5, p. 513]`
*   Building a Personal Altar: A daily, conscious act.
    *   `[Whiteboard: Daily Altar Steps]`
    *   1.  **Acknowledge:** Recognize God's ownership (1 Cor 6:19-20).
    *   2.  **Yield:** Specifically name and surrender faculties/areas (mind, eyes, will, plans, relationships) to God's control (Rom 12:1).
    *   3.  **Ask:** Invite the Holy Spirit to fill, empower, and direct (Luke 11:13, Eph 5:18).
*   [Analogy (from Rom 12:1): Consecration is like handing God the keys to every single room of your house, including the messy closets and locked basement, not just the presentable living room.]
*   The Result: Union with Christ, transformation. `[Quote concept: EGW - Results of yielding, heart united with His - Ref *Steps to Christ*, p. 70-71]`
*   [Aside: *"Instead of spending resources solely on ourselves, especially during seasons often focused on materialism, we can demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love. It's like finding a coin—even though it came from a worldly system, yielding our resources (time, money, energy) allows God to put them to work for His kingdom, opening doors for truth."*]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

*   Summary: True spiritual renewal isn't complex formulas but simple, total surrender (Rom 12:1).
*   The Simplicity Revealed: Our part is willingness; God's part is the transforming power (Phil 2:13). `[Whiteboard: Willingness (You) + Power (God) = Transformation]`
*   Connection to Character & Readiness: This daily surrender *is* the process of character perfection, preparing us to reflect Jesus fully (Ref *Christ's Object Lessons*, p. 69). It's foundational for the final generation.
*   Final **(RQ):** Have you truly placed *everything* on the altar today? Is there any part of your 'body' – your time, talents, thoughts, will – held back from God?
*   Gentle Invitation: Encourage a personal moment of commitment. Build your altar now. Decide to make this surrender a daily reality.
*   Closing Prayer: Focus on consecration, asking for grace to yield completely and experience His transforming power.
