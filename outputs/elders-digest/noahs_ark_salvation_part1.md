### Introduction (5 min)
-   Welcome & Prayer
-   Introduce topic: Noah's Ark as more than a story – a profound picture of God's plan of salvation.
-   Brief overview: We'll examine Noah the man, his world, his actions, and the parallels to our time, focusing on faith and obedience.
-   Central Question: What can Noah's experience teach us about navigating *our* world and securing salvation? **(RQ)**
-   `[Write on board: Noah's Ark = Salvation]`

### Section 1: A Man Apart - Noah's Character (10 min)
-   **Noah Found Grace:** (Gen 6:8) - Start with God's initiative.
-   **Who Was Noah?** (Gen 6:9)
    -   "A just man": Righteous in conduct, aligned with God's will.
    -   "Perfect in his generations": Complete, mature, spiritually whole *relative to his time*. Not sinless, but sincere.
    -   "Noah walked with God": Intimate, ongoing relationship (like Enoch, Gen 5:24). Contrast with world walking its own way.
    -   `[Write on board: Noah (Gen 6:9): Just | Perfect | Walked w/ God]`
-   **The Source of Righteousness:** (Heb 11:7)
    -   His righteousness was *by faith*. Believing God's warning about the unseen.
    -   Faith led to action ("moved with fear, prepared an ark").
    -   `[Add to board under Noah: -> Faith (Heb 11:7)]`
-   What does it mean to 'walk with God' today? **(RQ)** How does faith become righteousness for us? (cf. Rom 4:3, 5)

### Section 2: A World Condemned (8 min)
-   **The Global Context:** (Gen 6:5, 11-12)
    -   Wickedness was great; every imagination of thoughts was evil continually (v. 5).
    -   Earth was corrupt before God.
    -   Earth was filled with violence.
    -   `[Write on board: World (Gen 6:5, 11-12): Corrupt | Violent | Evil Thoughts]`
-   **God's Assessment:** (Gen 6:6-7) - God grieved, determined judgment.
-   **The Stark Contrast:** Noah stood out. He was a remnant, representing God's standard in a degenerate age.
    -   `[Draw simple diagram: Circle (World: Corruption) with small dot inside (Noah: Righteousness)]`
-   How does the description of Noah's world resonate with ours? **(RQ)** Where do we see similar trends? (cf. 2 Tim 3:1-5)
-   `[Aside: Like Lot in Sodom, Noah was 'vexed' (2 Pet 2:7-8 implied) by the ungodliness around him. Our sensitivity to sin diminishes if we don't actively cultivate walking with God.]`

### Section 3: Faith in Action - Obedience & Witness (10 min) [*]
-   **The Divine Command:** (Gen 6:13-21) - Specific, detailed instructions for the Ark.
    -   Seemingly illogical task – building a massive boat far from any sea, for rain that hadn't fallen like that before.
-   **Noah's Response:** (Gen 6:22)
    -   "Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he."
    -   Absolute, unquestioning obedience. No recorded argument or doubt.
    -   `[Write on board: God Commands (Gen 6:13-21) -> Noah Obeys (Gen 6:22)]`
-   **The Preacher of Righteousness:** (2 Peter 2:5)
    -   Noah didn't just build; he warned.
    -   His actions *and* words were a testimony against the world's wickedness and a call to repentance.
    -   `[Analogy: The Ark construction itself was a 120-year sermon in wood and faith.]`
-   **Saving His House:** (Heb 11:7)
    -   His faith and obedience were instrumental in his family's salvation.
    -   A leader's faithfulness impacts those closest to them.
-   What commands from God seem difficult or counter-cultural for us to obey today? **(RQ)** How does our obedience (or lack thereof) preach to the world? **(RQ)**

### Section 4: Then and Now - The End-Time Parallel (7 min)
-   **Jesus' Direct Comparison:** (Matt 24:37-39)
    -   "But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be."
    -   People engrossed in everyday life (eating, drinking, marrying) - oblivious to impending judgment.
    -   The flood came unexpectedly upon the unprepared.
    -   `[Write on board: Days of Noah (Matt 24:37-39) = Last Days]`
    -   `[Write Question: Are we living unaware? ]`
-   **The Call for Today:**
    -   Recognize the signs of the times, mirroring Noah's day. (Need/Question from text)
    -   Stand firm in faith and obedience despite cultural pressure (like Noah). (Biblical Principle from text: Heb 11:7, Gen 6:22)
    -   Be 'preachers of righteousness' through word and godly living. (Bridging from text: 2 Pet 2:5)
    -   Influence our families toward the 'ark' of safety in Christ. (Bridging from text: Heb 11:7)
-   `[Aside: Just as the Ark had only one door, Christ is the only door to salvation (John 10:9). Our message must point clearly to Him.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)
-   **Recap:** Noah's example: Found grace, walked with God, stood apart through faith, obeyed completely, preached righteousness, saved his family, foreshadowed our time.
-   **The Ark Today:** Christ is our Ark of refuge from the coming judgment (cf. 1 Peter 3:20-21 - baptism saving us through Christ's resurrection).
-   **Personal Reflection:** Are we living by faith like Noah? Are we walking with God? Are we obeying His commands, even when difficult? **(RQ)** Are we building a life founded on His Word?
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Noah's Example):**
    1.  **Walk Closer:** Commit to 10 minutes daily this week for prayer and reading God's Word, asking specifically how to 'walk with God' like Noah (Gen 6:9).
    2.  **Obey Intentionally:** Identify one specific area where God's command feels challenging (like Noah's task) and take one concrete step in obedience this week (Gen 6:22).
    3.  **Share the Warning:** Prayerfully consider one person you can share with this week about the relevance of Noah's story for our times and the safety found in Christ (Matt 24:37-39; 2 Pet 2:5).
-   **Invitation:** God calls us today, as He called Noah, to enter the Ark of safety. Choose faith, choose obedience, choose Christ.
