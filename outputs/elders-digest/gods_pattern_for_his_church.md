### Introduction (5 min)

- **The Need:** Does the modern church reflect God's original design? **(RQ)**
  Are we experiencing the same vitality?
- **The Blueprint:** God didn't leave us guessing. Acts 2 provides a divine
  pattern.
- **Goal:** To rediscover God's blueprint in Acts 2 and see how it applies
  today.
- [Whiteboard: Title - God's Blueprint: The Acts 2 Church]
- Central Verse Introduction: Acts 2:42 sets the stage for their core
  activities.

### Section 1: The Foundation - Power & Message (12 min)

- **A. Divine Empowerment (Acts 2:1-4)**
  - Not human strategy, but Holy Spirit power launched the church.
  - Unity preceded power (Acts 2:1 - "one accord").
  - [Whiteboard: Unity -> Power (Acts 2:1, 4)]
  - **(RQ)** Do we seek this power first, or rely on our own plans?
- **B. The Right Message (Acts 2:14-36, esp. 22-24, 36)**
  - Peter's sermon: Uncompromisingly Christ-centered.
    - Jesus: His life, death, resurrection (v. 22-24).
    - Sin: Confronted directly ("whom ye have crucified" v. 36).
    - Salvation: Through Christ alone (v. 21, 38).
    - God's Sovereignty: His plan unfolded (v. 23).
  - [Whiteboard: Message = Christ + Sin + Salvation + Sovereignty (Acts
    2:22-36)]
  - **(RQ)** Is our message today this clear, this focused on the core Gospel?
  - [Aside: Like a physician diagnosing the illness (sin) before prescribing the
    cure (Christ), the early church didn't shy away from hard truths because
    they held the only remedy.]

### Section 2: The Members - Saved & Steadfast (10 min) [*]

- **A. Saved Members (Acts 2:37-41)**
  - Conviction led to action ("What shall we do?" v. 37).
  - Response: Repentance and Baptism (v. 38, 41) - clear commitment.
  - Result: Added _to_ the church (v. 41, 47) - genuine conversion.
  - [Whiteboard: Conviction -> Repentance -> Baptism -> Added (Acts 2:37-41)]
- **B. Separated & Steadfast Members (Acts 2:42)**
  - **Separated:** Implied in their distinct community and practices, turning
    _from_ former ways _to_ Christ's way.
  - **Steadfast:** "Continued stedfastly" - commitment wasn't fleeting.
    - Apostles' Doctrine (Truth)
    - Fellowship (Community)
    - Breaking of Bread (Worship/Remembrance)
    - Prayers (Dependence)
  - [Whiteboard: Steadfast In: Doctrine | Fellowship | Worship | Prayer (Acts
    2:42)]
  - **(RQ)** How does our church membership reflect this level of commitment and
    distinction from the world?
- **C. Servant Members (Acts 2:44-45)**
  - Practical care: Meeting needs, sharing resources.
  - Not forced communism, but voluntary generosity born of love.
  - [Analogy (from Acts 2:45): Like a family pooling resources in a crisis,
    their love overflowed into practical support.]

### Section 3: The Program - Unity & Action (10 min)

- **A. United Worship & Fellowship (Acts 2:42, 46)**
  - Corporate gatherings: Temple courts (public witness) & homes (intimate
    fellowship).
  - Key elements: Doctrine, fellowship, breaking bread, prayers (v. 42).
  - Atmosphere: Gladness, simplicity of heart, praising God (v. 46-47).
  - [Whiteboard: Worship = Truth + Community + Remembrance + Prayer + Joy (Acts
    2:42, 46-47)]
- **B. Teamwork & Witnessing (Acts 2:43, 47)**
  - Apostles led, but all participated.
  - Wonders and signs confirmed the message (v. 43).
  - Favour with people + Lord adding daily = Active, attractive witness (v. 47).
  - [Whiteboard: Program = Worship + Fellowship + Service + Witness (Acts
    2:42-47)]
  - **(RQ)** Does our church program reflect this balance of inward devotion and
    outward action?
  - [Aside: Their unity wasn't just agreement on doctrine; it was a shared life
    and mission. This collective witness was magnetic, drawing others not just
    to a building, but to a transformed community centered on Christ.]

### Section 4: The Power Source - Christ's Lordship (3 min)

- **A. Powerful Lord (Acts 2:33, 36)**
  - Peter emphasizes the exalted Christ pouring out the Spirit.
  - He is both "Lord and Christ".
- **B. Personal Lord (Acts 2:47)**
  - "The Lord added to the church daily" - He is actively building His church.
  - Obedience to Him is paramount (Implied throughout Acts - following apostles'
    teaching derived from Him).
  - Reference: Ephesians 1:22-23 - Christ is the Head.
  - [Whiteboard: Christ = Head & Power Source (Acts 2:33, Eph 1:22)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** God's pattern is clear: Spirit-empowered, Christ-centered message,
  committed members, united program, all under Christ's Lordship.
- **The Challenge:** Compare this blueprint to our current reality. **(RQ)**
  Where have we drifted?
- **The Call (Matthew 28:19-20):** Return to the commitment, unity, power, and
  missionary focus of the early church.
  - **Need:** Re-center on the pure Gospel message.
  - **Principle:** Recommit to steadfast discipleship (Acts 2:42).
  - **Bridge:** What does "apostles' doctrine and fellowship" look like in our
    context?
  - **Action Steps:**
    1.  Personal: Re-evaluate commitment to prayer & God's Word this week.
    2.  Communal: Intentionally seek deeper fellowship & unity.
    3.  Missional: Ask God for one opportunity to share Christ this week.
  - [Whiteboard: Action: Pray | Study | Connect | Share]
- **Invitation:** Let's ask God to restore the Acts 2 pattern in our hearts and
  in His church today. Let's commit to being the church He designed.
