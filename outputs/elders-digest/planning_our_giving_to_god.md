### Introduction (5 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Does God care _how_ we give, or just _that_ we give? Is
  there a divine plan for supporting His work? **(RQ)**
- Everything originates with God – even planning and giving.
- Our giving reflects our understanding of God's ownership and our partnership
  with Him.
- [Write on board: God = Owner; We = Stewards]

### God: The Original Planner & Giver (8 min)

- **Biblical Principle:** God is the ultimate source and planner.
  - The plan of salvation itself was established before creation (Rev 13:8).
    - [Whiteboard: Rev 13:8 - Lamb slain from foundation]
  - God _planned_ creation through His Word (Heb 11:3).
  - His greatest gift – Jesus – was a planned act of love (John 3:16).
- **Bridging to Practice:** If God planned the ultimate gift, shouldn't our
  response involve thoughtful planning? **(RQ)**
- Our giving originates from recognizing His prior gift.

### The Gospel Commission: A Planned Endeavor (10 min)

- **Biblical Principle:** Jesus established a plan for global mission.
  - The Strategy: Witnessing in expanding circles (Acts 1:8).
    - [Whiteboard: Acts 1:8 - Jerusalem -> Judea -> Samaria -> Ends of Earth]
  - The Mandate: Make disciples, baptize, teach (Matt 28:19-20).
    - This requires organization, resources, and _planning_.
  - Counting the Cost: Jesus taught the wisdom of planning (Luke 14:28 -
    building a tower).
    - [Analogy: Building God's kingdom requires planning, like any major
      project.]
- **The Need:** How can this global work be sustained systematically?

### Systematic Benevolence: God's Plan for Giving (12 min) [*]

- **Biblical Principle:** God ordained a regular, proportionate system.
  - The Apostolic Rule: Regular, planned setting aside (1 Cor 16:2).
    - [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 16:2 - "Lay by him in store" = Planned, Regular,
      Proportionate]
  - Confirmed by Spirit of Prophecy as God's method for today.
- **Defining the Components:**
  - **Tithe:**
    - God's Holy Portion: 10% of all increase (Lev 27:30).
      - [Whiteboard: Lev 27:30 - Tithe = HOLY to the LORD]
    - Not ours to decide _if_ or _where_ – it belongs to God.
    - Designated Purpose: The Storehouse (Mal 3:10) – Supports the ministry
      (gospel workers) via the Conference treasury (received through local
      church).
      - [Aside: Think of the storehouse like the central treasury ensuring the
        whole kingdom's infrastructure is supported, not just one local area. It
        ensures fairness and broad reach.]
  - **Offerings:**
    - Given Freely: Above and beyond the tithe, as God prospers (Deut 16:17).
    - Purpose: Support local church operations, ministries, development, world
      missions, special projects.
    - [Whiteboard: Tithe (God's) vs. Offerings (Our Response)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** This system isn't burdensome; it's God's design for
  consistent support and blessing.

### Blessings & Purpose of Planned Giving (5 min)

- **Biblical Principle:** Obedience in giving connects us to God's promises.
  - Covenant Relationship: Giving is an act of faith and loyalty (Mal 3:10a).
  - Putting God First: Acknowledges His ownership before our own spending.
  - Facilitates God's Work: Enables church budgeting and mission planning.
    - [Aside: Just as a family needs a budget, God's work operates more
      effectively when His people follow His financial plan. It allows for
      planning ministry, not just reacting.]
  - Ensures Equity: Systematic approach supports the _entire_ work, not just
    favored projects.
  - Promised Blessings: God promises to bless faithfulness (Mal 3:10b;
    Testimonies vol 3, p. 395).
    - [Whiteboard: Mal 3:10 - Obedience -> Open Windows of Heaven]
- **The Question:** Are we partnering with God according to His plan? **(RQ)**

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** God, the ultimate planner, gave His all. He invites us into
  partnership through a clear plan: Systematic Benevolence (Tithe & Offerings).
- This isn't just about money; it's about trust, obedience, and participating in
  His mission.
- Following God's plan (1 Cor 16:2, Mal 3:10) ensures the Gospel Commission
  (Matt 28:19-20) is funded systematically.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1.  Prayerfully review your understanding of Tithe and Offerings based on
      Scripture (Lev 27:30, Mal 3:10).
  2.  Commit/Recommit to returning God's Tithe faithfully through the storehouse
      (local church to conference).
  3.  Plan regular, proportionate offerings as God has blessed you (1 Cor 16:2).
- **Invitation:** Will you partner with God according to His divine plan,
  trusting His promises and participating fully in His work?
