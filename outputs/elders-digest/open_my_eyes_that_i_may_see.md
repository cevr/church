### Introduction (6 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the theme: The vital need for _divine_ help to truly understand
  spiritual things (1 Cor 2:14).
- Read Central Verse: Psalm 119:18. What does it mean to have our eyes 'opened'?
  **(RQ)**
- Analogy: Like needing light to see in a dark room, we need God's Spirit to see
  spiritual truth.
- Brief overview: We'll explore why we need this sight (Ps 119:18), what hinders
  it (2 Cor 4:4), how God grants it (Luke 24:45), and what we see as a result
  (Isa 6:1, 5).

### Section 1: The Prayer for Spiritual Sight (8 min)

- **Why Pray This? The Need for Divine Illumination**
  - Our natural understanding is limited regarding spiritual matters (1 Cor
    2:14).
  - We need God's intervention to grasp His Word; He must open our understanding
    (Luke 24:45).
    - [Whiteboard: Luke 24:45 - Jesus Opens Understanding]
    - Even disciples needed supernatural help _after_ the resurrection! **(RQ)**
      How much more do we?
  - This isn't just about information, but transformation (Rom 12:2).
- **The Connection to Life and Obedience**
  - Seeing God's Word leads to _living_ and _keeping_ it (Psalm 119:17).
  - Spiritual sight isn't passive; it's linked to active obedience, being doers
    of the Word (James 1:22).

### Section 2: Hindrances to Seeing Clearly [*] (10 min)

- **Improper Motive in Seeking God**
  - Prayer for show vs. prayer for genuine communion hinders sight (Matthew
    6:5-8).
    - [Whiteboard: Motive Matters! (Matt 6:5-8)]
    - If our motive is self-serving, asking amiss, God may not reveal deep
      truths (James 4:3). **(RQ)**
  - Selfishness blinds us to God's will and truth (Implied in Matt 6:5-8).
- **The Veil of Sin**
  - Sin darkens the spiritual perception, leading to alienation from God (Eph
    4:18).
  - Seeing God reveals our own sinfulness (Isaiah 6:5), which we often try to
    hide, thus closing our eyes.
  - Unconfessed sin hinders our ability to see God clearly, separating us from
    Him (Isaiah 59:2).
- **Satan's Active Opposition**
  - The 'god of this world' actively blinds the minds of unbelievers (2
    Corinthians 4:4a).
    - [Whiteboard: Satan Blinds (2 Cor 4:3-4) <- Unbelief]
    - He doesn't want us seeing the 'light of the glorious gospel of Christ' (2
      Corinthians 4:4b).
    - [Aside: Like static on a radio, sin and Satan's influence interfere with
      our reception of God's clear signal in His Word. We must actively tune in
      through prayer and surrender (James 4:7).]

### Section 3: How God Opens Our Eyes (10 min)

- **The Prerequisite: Reverence and Prayer**
  - Approach Bible study with prayer and reverence, not presumption (Ref. EGW,
    Steps to Christ, p. 110).
  - [Whiteboard: Approach: Prayer + Reverence (SC 110)]
  - God reveals Himself to the humble and seeking heart (Matt 11:25), giving
    grace to the humble (James 4:6).
- **The Agent: The Holy Spirit**
  - The Spirit guides into all truth (John 16:13).
  - He illuminates the Word, teaching and reminding us (John 14:26; cf. Luke
    24:45).
  - We must actively ask for the Spirit's teaching (Luke 11:13).
- **The Instrument: God's Word Itself**
  - The entrance (understanding) of God's words gives light (Psalm 119:130).
  - As we engage with Scripture prayerfully, God uses the text itself to open
    our understanding (cf. Ps 119:18).
  - [Write Question (from Ps 119:18): Are we asking God to open our eyes
    *before* we open His Word?]

### Section 4: What Open Eyes Behold (6 min)

- **A Clearer Vision of God**
  - Isaiah saw the Lord in His holiness and majesty (Isaiah 6:1-4).
  - The primary wonder ("wondrous things" - Ps 119:18) is God Himself â€“ His
    character, glory, love (cf. Ex 33:18-19).
- **An Honest View of Self**
  - Seeing God reveals our own need and sinfulness (Isaiah 6:5; Luke 5:8).
- **Wonders in God's Law/Word**
  - Seeing the beauty, wisdom, perfection, and life-giving power within
    Scripture (Ps 119:18; Ps 19:7-10).
  - Understanding God's plan of salvation revealed throughout His Word (Luke
    24:27, 44).

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen our desperate need for God to open our eyes (Ps
  119:18), the hindrances like wrong motives and sin (Matt 6, Isa 59:2) and
  Satan's blinding work (2 Cor 4:4). But God _does_ open eyes through humble
  prayer, His Spirit, and His Word (Luke 24:45, John 16:13, Ps 119:130),
  revealing Himself and His truth (Isa 6:1, Ps 119:18).
- **Need/Question (from text):** The core need remains: How can _we_, today,
  experience this eye-opening promised in Psalm 119:18?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** God opens the eyes of those who humbly ask
  (Ps 119:18), seek Him sincerely (Matt 6:6), rely on His Spirit (Luke 11:13),
  and engage reverently with His Word (Ps 119:130).
- **Bridging (from text):** This ancient prayer is not just poetry; it's a vital
  necessity for navigating life and understanding God's will amidst modern
  confusion and the spiritual blindness Satan promotes (2 Cor 4:4).
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  Make Psalm 119:18 your personal prayer _before_ you read the Bible each
      day.
  2.  Honestly examine your motives in prayer and study (cf. Matt 6:5-8). Seek
      God for Himself.
  3.  Consciously ask for the Holy Spirit's guidance every time you study (Luke
      11:13).
  4.  When God reveals something about Himself or your own heart, respond with
      humility and obedience (cf. Isa 6:5, 8).
- **Invitation:** Will you commit this week to praying "Open my eyes" before you
  read God's Word? Will you ask the Holy Spirit to reveal wondrous things to
  you? Let's seek Him for true spiritual sight.
