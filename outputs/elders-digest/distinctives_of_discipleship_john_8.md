### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Many claim to follow Christ. What did _Jesus_ say distinguishes a true
  disciple? **(RQ)**
- Introduce Topic: Exploring the non-negotiable marks of discipleship directly
  from Christ's words in John 8.
- Central Verse Emphasis: Read John 8:31-32. Highlight the conditional nature
  ("If ye continue...").
- [Write on board: John 8:31-32 - The Disciple's Test]
- Brief Overview: We'll examine three key distinctives: Continuance, Freedom,
  and Evidence.

### Section 1: The Foundation - Continuance in the Word (10 min)

- **The Need:** Superficial belief vs. genuine discipleship.
- **The Biblical Principle (John 8:31):** True discipleship requires
  _continuance_ (Gr. _meno_ - abide, remain, dwell) in Christ's word.
  - Not just initial belief, but ongoing relationship with His teachings.
  - [Write on board: CONTINUE (meno) = Abide / Remain / Dwell]
  - Contrast with temporary followers (John 6:66).
- **Bridging to Practice:** What does 'continuing in His word' look like daily?
  **(RQ)**
  - Consistent study, meditation, obedience.
  - Allowing the Word to shape thoughts, motives, actions.
  - [Aside: Like building a house on rock vs. sand (Matt 7:24-27), continuance
    provides a stable foundation against life's storms.]
- **Actionable Steps (from John 8:31):**
  1.  Commit to daily time in God's Word.
  2.  Pray for the Holy Spirit's help to understand and obey.
  3.  Seek to apply one specific truth learned each day.
  - [Whiteboard: Action: Daily Word -> Understand -> Apply]
- **Invitation:** Are we merely hearers, or are we _continuing_ in His Word?

### Section 2: The Fruit - Freedom Through Truth (12 min) [*]

- **The Need:** Many live in bondage (addiction, fear, guilt) while claiming
  freedom in Christ.
- **The Biblical Principle (John 8:32, 34-36):** Knowing and continuing in the
  _truth_ (Christ's word) leads to _freedom_ from the bondage of sin.
  - Jesus defines the default state: servant (slave) of sin (v. 34).
  - [Write on board: Sin = Bondage (v.34)]
  - Only the Son (Jesus) can grant true, lasting freedom (v. 36).
  - [Write on board: Son = Freedom (v.36)]
  - This freedom isn't license, but liberation _from_ sin's power.
- **Bridging to Practice:** How does abiding in truth break chains? **(RQ)**
  - Truth exposes lies, corrects error, empowers right choices (cf. Rom
    6:17-18).
  - [Analogy (from verse 36): Like a presidential pardon - sets free legally and
    empowers a new life.]
- **Actionable Steps (from John 8:32, 36):**
  1.  Identify areas of personal bondage (sin habits, wrong thinking).
  2.  Apply specific scriptural truths (promises, commands) to those areas.
  3.  Claim the Son's power daily for liberation.
  - [Whiteboard: Action: Identify Bondage -> Apply Truth -> Claim Son's Power]
- **Invitation:** Embrace the truth found in Christ's word to experience genuine
  freedom.

### Section 3: The Evidence - Actions Reveal Allegiance (12 min)

- **The Need:** Danger of relying on heritage, profession, or association rather
  than genuine heart transformation (cf. John 8:33, 39).
- **The Biblical Principle (John 8:39-47):** True discipleship is evidenced by
  Christlike behavior and hearing God's words, not mere claims or lineage.
  - Jesus contrasts their claim (children of Abraham) with their actions
    (seeking to kill Him) (v. 37, 39-40).
  - [Write on board: Claim: Abraham's Children vs. Action: Murderous Intent]
  - Actions reveal true spiritual parentage (v. 41, 44).
  - [Write on board: Your Works => Your Father (v.41, 44)]
  - Inability/unwillingness to hear (accept, obey) God's words indicates not
    being 'of God' (v. 47).
  - [RQ: Based on v. 47, what does our response to God's Word reveal about our
    relationship with Him?]
- **The Biblical Principle (John 8:48-59):** True disciples honor Christ and
  keep His sayings.
  - Contrast: The Jews dishonored Him (v. 48-49), but Jesus sought the Father's
    glory (v. 50, 54).
  - Keeping His saying = life, seeing God's glory (v. 51).
  - [Whiteboard: Honor Christ = Keep His Saying (v.51)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** How do our daily choices demonstrate who we truly
  follow and honor? **(RQ)**
  - [Aside: Our church affiliation or family history means little if our daily
    lives contradict the teachings of Christ. True heritage is spiritual, shown
    by obedience born of faith.]
  - Honoring Christ means valuing His word above opinions, traditions, or
    personal desires.
- **Actionable Steps (from John 8:39, 47, 51):**
  1.  Honestly examine actions: Do they align with Christ's teachings?
  2.  Cultivate a heart willing to _hear_ and _obey_ God's Word, even when
      difficult.
  3.  Intentionally seek to honor Christ in speech and conduct.
  - [Whiteboard: Action: Examine Actions -> Hear & Obey -> Honor Christ]
- **Invitation:** Let our lives, not just our lips, declare our discipleship.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Recap the three distinctives from John 8:
  1.  **Continuance:** Abiding in His Word (v. 31).
  2.  **Freedom:** Liberation from sin through Truth (v. 32, 36).
  3.  **Evidence:** Actions and honoring Christ reveal true allegiance (v. 39,
      47, 51).
- **Illustration Concept (Perseverance):** Paderewski, the great pianist, when
  told he was a genius, reportedly replied, "Perhaps, but before I was a genius,
  I was a drudge." Discipleship requires sustained effort, practice, and
  determination, empowered by grace. It's not instant; it requires
  _continuance_.
- **Final Thought:** True discipleship isn't a title we claim, but a reality we
  live out through dependence on Christ and commitment to His Word.
- **Appeal:** Based on Christ's own words in John 8, are you a disciple
  _indeed_? Choose today to _continue_ in His Word, embrace His _freedom_, and
  let your life _evidence_ your love and honor for Him. Commit to the daily
  'drudgery' of abiding that leads to the 'genius' of Christlikeness.
