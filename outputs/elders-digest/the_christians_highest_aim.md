### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** What is the single most important goal you could achieve in life?
  Wealth? Fame? Accomplishment?
- **Introduce Topic:** Paul, a man of high status, reveals a radically different
  priority. The Christian's highest aim isn't _doing_ something for God, but
  _knowing_ God personally.
- **Central Verse Focus:** Read Philippians 3:8. Emphasize the contrast: "all
  things" vs. "excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus".
  - `[Whiteboard: ALL THINGS < KNOWING CHRIST (Phil 3:8)]`
- **Outline Preview:** Today we'll explore _why_ knowing Christ is supreme (Phil
  3:8), what it means to be 'found in Him' with _His_ righteousness (Phil 3:9,
  John 15), and how this knowledge transforms us (Gal 2:20, John 17:3).

### Section 1: The Supreme Value of Knowing Christ (10 min)

- **Paul's Testimony (Phil 3:4-8):** Briefly list Paul's credentials
  (background, zeal) - things he once valued.
- **The Great Exchange (Phil 3:8):** He counts it all "loss" and "dung". Why?
  **(RQ)**
  - Because he found something infinitely more valuable: "the excellency of the
    knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord."
  - `[Whiteboard: Worldly Value (Loss/Dung) vs. Knowledge of Christ (Excellency)]`
- **Winning Christ (Phil 3:8b):** This isn't earning salvation, but gaining Him
  as the supreme treasure, the relationship itself.
- **Experiential Knowledge (Phil 3:10a):** "That I may _know_ him..." - This
  Greek word (_ginóskó_) implies deep, personal, experiential knowledge, not
  just intellectual facts.
  - It's knowing His power in resurrection life and sharing in His path
    (fellowship of sufferings).
  - `[Write Question on Board (from Phil 3:10): What does it mean to *know* Christ beyond facts? ]`
- **Modern Parallel:** What 'dung' are we clinging to that hinders us from
  valuing Christ above all? **(RQ)** Possessions? Reputation? Comfort?

### Section 2: Found in Him & True Righteousness (12 min) [*]

- **The Goal: Being "Found in Him" (Phil 3:9a):** What does this mean? **(RQ)**
  - Not standing before God based on our own merits or efforts.
  - `[Analogy (from John 15): Like a branch finding its place *in* the vine, drawing life *from* it.]`
- **Contrast: Self-Righteousness vs. God's Righteousness (Phil 3:9b):**
  - "Not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law..."
    - Connect to Isaiah 64:6 - Our best efforts, apart from Christ, are like
      "filthy rags" before a holy God.
    - `[Whiteboard: Self-Righteousness (Law/Effort) = Isa 64:6]`
  - "...but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which
    is of God by faith."
    - This is _imputed_ righteousness – Christ's perfect record credited to us.
    - `[Whiteboard: God's Righteousness (Faith/Christ) = Phil 3:9]`
    - This is Justification: Declared righteous, not because of what _we_ do,
      but because of who _He_ is and what _He_ did.
- **Abiding in the Vine (John 15:4-5):**
  - Read John 15:4-5. Being "found in Him" requires actively "abiding" in Him.
  - `[Draw simple diagram: Vine (Christ) <--> Branch (Believer) = Fruit (Righteousness/Life)]`
  - Apart from Him, we can do _nothing_ of eternal value (v. 5b).
  - **(RQ)** How does daily dependence on Christ (prayer, study) reflect this
    abiding? How does it contrast with trying to produce righteousness on our
    own (Isa 64:6)?

### Section 3: Transformation Through Knowing (12 min)

- **From Justification to Sanctification:** Being declared righteous
  (justification) opens the door for being _made_ righteous (sanctification).
- **Christ Living In Us (Galatians 2:20):**
  - Read Galatians 2:20. "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet
    not I, but Christ liveth in me..."
  - This isn't losing identity, but exchanging a life dominated by self/sin for
    one empowered and directed by Christ through the Holy Spirit.
  - `[Whiteboard: Gal 2:20 - Old Life (Self/Crucified) -> New Life (Christ In Me)]`
- **The New Creation (2 Corinthians 5:17):**
  - "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are
    passed away; behold, all things are become new."
  - This knowledge of Christ isn't static; it's transformative.
  - `[Aside: It's like restoring a corrupted file. God doesn't just patch the errors; He replaces the corrupted data with the perfect code of Christ's character, accessed through faith.]`
- **Eternal Life IS Knowing God (John 17:3):**
  - Read John 17:3. Jesus defines eternal life _as_ knowing the Father and the
    Son.
  - This reinforces that the _relationship_ is the essence, the core of
    salvation and eternal life.
  - **(RQ)** Based on John 17:3, how does our pursuit of knowing God compare to
    our pursuit of other 'eternal life insurance' activities?
- **Practical Transformation:** This deep knowledge changes desires, attitudes,
  actions. It empowers witness because we speak of One we _know_ personally.
  - `[Hypothetical Concept (based on Gal 2:20): Imagine facing a temptation. The 'old self' reacts one way. How might 'Christ living in me' respond differently through dependence on Him? ]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:**
  - The highest aim isn't worldly success, but the surpassing value of knowing
    Christ personally (Phil 3:8).
  - True righteousness isn't earned but received by faith, being 'found in Him'
    (Phil 3:9, John 15).
  - This knowledge isn't mere information; it's a transformative relationship
    where Christ lives in us (Gal 2:20, John 17:3).
- **Drawing Life from Christ:** Reiterate the need for constant connection, like
  branches to the vine (John 15). This is how we experience His power (Phil
  3:10) and bear fruit.
  - Reference EGW concept: We must be constantly drawing life and strength from
    Christ (COL 129 concept).
  - `[Aside: Our spiritual life isn't a battery we charge once a week; it's a continuous stream we must stay connected to. Like a phone needing its charger, we constantly need the power source found only in Christ.]`
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
  - **Value:** Consciously choose to value time spent knowing Christ
    (prayer/study) above other pursuits (Phil 3:8).
  - **Abide:** Intentionally connect with Christ daily, asking for His
    righteousness and strength (John 15:4-5; Phil 3:9).
  - **Yield:** Practice yielding moment-by-moment decisions to the leading of
    Christ within (Gal 2:20).
  - `[Whiteboard: Action: 1. Value Him (Phil 3:8) 2. Abide Daily (Jn 15:4) 3. Yield Moments (Gal 2:20)]`
- **Final Appeal:** Don't settle for knowing _about_ Christ. Seek to _know Him_.
  Count everything else as loss for this greatest treasure. Will you make
  knowing Him your highest aim today?
