the King of kings."

**Closing Hymn:** #300 "Rock of Ages" "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide

**Central Bible Verse:** Hebrews 4:14-16 - "Seeing then that we have a great
High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us

Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy
and find grace to help in time of need."

### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Many Christians focus on Jesus' past work (cross) or future return.
  But what is He doing _right now_? Why does it matter? **(RQ)**
- **The Need:** Misunderstanding Jesus' current role leads to weak faith, lack
  of assurance, and ineffective Christian living.
- **Central Truth:** Jesus is not idle; He is actively ministering in heaven
  _for us_. (Heb 4:14-16)
  - `[Write on board: Jesus' CURRENT Ministry]`
- **Outline Preview:** Briefly mention the key areas: His position, His
  intercession, His headship, His preparation, and our connection.

### Section 1: Exalted King & Victor (10 min)

- **Principle:** Jesus' ascension wasn't retirement; it was coronation and the
  start of His heavenly ministry.
- **Biblical Foundation:**
  - **Ascended & Seated:** Mark 16:19 - Received up, sat at God's right hand.
    Signifies completed earthly work, accepted sacrifice.
  - **Exalted by the Father:** Acts 2:33 - Exalted, received the Spirit.
    Philippians 2:9-11 - Highly exalted, given the name above all names.
    `[Write on board: Exalted King (Phil 2:9)]`
  - **Position of Authority:** Ephesians 1:19-23 - Seated far above all
    principality, power, might, dominion. Head over _all things_ to the church.
    - `[Draw simple diagram: Earth -> Cross -> Ascension -> Right Hand (Power/Authority)]`
- **Significance:** His position guarantees His authority over sin, death, and
  Satan. His victory is the basis for ours. **(RQ)** How does knowing He holds
  this power change how we view our struggles?
- **Bridge:** This isn't just historical fact; it's the foundation of His
  _current_ work.

### Section 2: Active High Priest - Interceding [*] (12 min)

- **The Need:** We still sin, we face temptation, we feel weak. Who pleads our
  case? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** Jesus lives to make intercession for us. (Heb 7:25)
  - `[Write on board: Jesus = Our Advocate (1 John 2:1)]`
- **Biblical Foundation:**
  - **Drawing Power:** John 12:32 - "If I am lifted up... will draw all peoples
    to Myself." His exaltation empowers His drawing ministry.
  - **Intercession:** Romans 8:34 - "Christ who died... who also makes
    intercession for us." He actively pleads our case based on His sacrifice.
    - `[Analogy (from Heb 4:15): Like a lawyer who not only knows the law but understands the client's exact struggle because he's been there.]`
  - **Advocacy:** 1 John 2:1-2 - "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
    Christ the righteous." He represents us when we fail, presenting His
    righteousness.
    - `[Whiteboard: His Blood (Heb 9:12) + His Righteousness (1 John 2:1) = Our Access (Heb 4:16)]`
- **Practical Application:**
  - **Need:** Feeling condemned or unworthy? (Rom 8:1)
  - **Principle:** Jesus is your Advocate _right now_. (1 John 2:1)
  - **Bridge:** His intercession isn't just for forgiveness, but for _power_ to
    overcome. (Heb 4:16 - "grace to help")
  - **Action:** Confess sin immediately, trusting His advocacy (1 John 1:9).
    Approach God boldly _because_ of Jesus. (Heb 4:16)
  - **Invitation:** Will you rely on His intercession daily?

### Section 3: Active Head - Directing & Preparing (12 min)

- **The Need:** How does the church function? Where does spiritual power come
  from? What's our future hope grounded in? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:** Jesus actively directs His church and prepares our
  eternal home.
- **Biblical Foundation:**
  - **Head of the Church:** Ephesians 1:22-23 - Head over all things _to the
    church_, which is His body. He provides direction and life.
    - `[Write on board: Jesus = Head; Church = Body (Eph 1:22-23)]`
  - **Giver of the Spirit & Gifts:** Acts 2:33 - Being exalted, He poured out
    the Holy Spirit. Romans 12:6 (cf. Eph 4:8, 11-12) - He distributes gifts for
    ministry through the Spirit.
    - `[Aside: Our church structure, our ministries, are meant to be channels for the life flowing from Christ, the Head. When we disconnect from Him, the body falters, like a limb cut off from the brain's signals.]`
  - **Building His Church:** Matthew 16:18 - "I will build My church." Acts
    2:47 - "The Lord added to the church daily..." This is His ongoing project.
  - **Preparing a Place:** John 14:2-3 - "I go to prepare a place for you... I
    will come again and receive you to Myself." His current work includes
    ensuring our future home.
    - `[Whiteboard: John 14:2 - Preparing -> Assurance]`
- **Practical Application:**
  - **Need:** Feeling directionless or powerless in service? Wondering about the
    future?

    Acts 2:33, Matt 16:18, John 14:2)
  - **Bridge:** Recognizing Him as active Head connects us to His power and
    purpose.

    and use the gifts He's given (Rom 12:6). Rest in the assurance of His
    preparation (John 14:3).

    headship.

  position are spiritually ours _now_ through faith.
  - `[Write on board: In Christ (Eph 2:6) = Shared Victory]`

  ministers to apply to you.

  asking for grace to live in light of these truths.
