### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** We live in an age of information overload. We hear many messages, even many sermons. But what distinguishes true hearing? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce Theme: Today we explore the vital connection between hearing God's Word and actively obeying it.
-   Central Verse Introduction: James makes this connection explicit. [Read James 1:22]
-   [Write on board: James 1:22 - Hearers vs. Doers]
-   Brief Overview: We'll examine what active hearing looks like, how the Word reveals our need, and how obedience flows from love and leads to true freedom.

### Section 1: Hearing That Requires Action (10 min)

-   **Foundation for Doing:** Before we can *do*, we must *hear* correctly. What does James say precedes being a 'doer'?
-   **Active Hearing (James 1:21):**
    -   "Lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness..." - Requires intentional purification. **(RQ)** What 'filthiness' (attitudes, habits, sins) hinders our reception of the Word today?
    -   "...receive with meekness the engrafted word..." - Requires humility and teachability, not defensiveness. [Write on board: Active Hearing = Purify + Receive Meekly (James 1:21)]
    -   "...which is able to save your souls." - The Word isn't just information; it's transformative power when received rightly.
-   **The Danger of Passive Hearing (James 1:22b):**
    -   "...not hearers only, deceiving your own selves." - Hearing without doing leads to self-deception about our spiritual state.
    -   [Concept: 'Sermon-sippers' - tasting but not digesting/applying. Contrast with 'good-ground hearers' who integrate the Word.]
    -   **Transition:** How does the Word help us avoid this self-deception?

### Section 2: The Word as a Revealing Mirror (12 min) [*]

-   **The Mirror Analogy (James 1:23-24):**
    -   If someone hears but doesn't *do*, they are like a person looking in a mirror.
    -   "Beholdeth himself... goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was." - The mirror (God's Word) reveals our true condition â€“ flaws, sins, inconsistencies.
    -   [Write on board: Word = Mirror (James 1:23)] [Draw simple mirror reflecting a face]
    -   **(RQ)** How often do we read or hear the Word, feel convicted, but then walk away unchanged, forgetting what we saw?
-   **The Purpose of the Mirror:** Not just to see, but to prompt action. [Analogy: Seeing dirt on your face in a mirror prompts washing.] The Word reveals sin so we can seek cleansing through Christ (1 John 1:9).
-   **Responding to the Reflection (James 1:25a):**
    -   Contrast: The one who *looks intently* into the Word...
    -   "Whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty..." - This isn't a casual glance, but careful, sustained examination.
    -   [Write on board: Look Intently -> Perfect Law of Liberty]
    -   **Transition:** What is this 'perfect law of liberty' we are to look into and obey?

### Section 3: Obedience: The Fruit of Love and True Liberty (12 min)

-   **Obedience Rooted in Love (John 14:15):**
    -   Jesus connects love and obedience directly. [Read John 14:15]
    -   Obedience isn't mere rule-keeping; it's the natural expression of love and gratitude for Christ's sacrifice.
    -   [Write Question on board (from John 14:15): How does my obedience (or lack thereof) reflect my love for Christ?]
-   **Understanding the 'Perfect Law of Liberty' (James 1:25):**
    -   This is God's standard of righteousness (often referencing the principles of the Decalogue as expanded by Christ).
    -   It's 'perfect' because it reflects God's character.
    -   It's the 'law of liberty' NOT because it frees us *from* obedience, but because Christ frees us *from sin's bondage* (Rom 6:1-2, 14) *enabling* us to obey joyfully through His grace.
    -   [Write on board: Law of Liberty = Freedom IN Obedience (enabled by Christ)]
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies, our lives should represent the kingdom of heaven through obedience to its laws, not conforming to the world's customs.]
-   **Continuance and Action (James 1:25b):**
    -   "...and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work..." - True faith involves perseverance in obedience, integrating the Word into daily life.
    -   Connects to EGW concept (COL p.60): Requires bringing habits, customs, practices into submission to God's Word. This is practical character building.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** True faith isn't passive hearing. It involves: (1) Actively receiving the Word with meekness (James 1:21), (2) Allowing the Word (mirror) to reveal our need (James 1:23-24), (3) Responding with loving obedience enabled by Christ (John 14:15), leading to (4) True freedom found in God's will (James 1:25).
-   **The Blessing (James 1:25c):**
    -   "...this man shall be blessed in his deed." - The blessing isn't primarily worldly gain, but the deep joy, peace, and honor of living in harmony with God, pleasing Him.
-   **Practical Application Steps:**
    -   **Listen Actively:** This week, approach Bible study/sermons asking God to reveal specific areas needing change. [Write on board: Action 1: Pray before Hearing]
    -   **Remove Hindrances:** Identify one 'filthiness' (habit/attitude) revealed by the Word and ask God for strength to 'lay it apart'. [Write on board: Action 2: Identify & Surrender One Hindrance]
    -   **Practice Obedience:** Choose one command/principle learned and intentionally practice it this week as an act of love for Christ. [Write on board: Action 3: Practice One Truth]
-   **Final Appeal:** Let us not be self-deceived hearers. Let us be 'doers of the word,' experiencing the liberty and blessing that comes from submitting our lives fully to Christ and His Word. Choose today to move beyond hearing to obedient faith.
