### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Briefly explain the Roman law context – soldiers could compel
  civilians to carry burdens for one mile (Angaria). Jesus uses this common
  grievance to teach a higher principle (Matt 5:41).
- **The Core Command:** Read Matthew 5:41. What does Jesus ask beyond mere
  compliance?
  - [Whiteboard: Matt 5:41 - Compel = 1 Mile (Duty) vs. Go Twain = 2 Miles
    (Discipleship)]
- **Defining the Terms:**
  - 'One-Mile Saints': Fulfill basic obligations, attend church, avoid major
    sins. Minimal involvement.
  - 'Two-Mile Saints': Go beyond duty willingly, actively serve, love
    sacrificially, reflect Christ's character.
- **Central Question:** Where do we find ourselves on this road? **(RQ)** Are we
  content with the first mile, or are we willing to follow Jesus into the
  second?

### Section 1: The Call to the Second Mile (Matt 5:41) (8 min)

- **Beyond Obligation:** Jesus' command transforms forced compliance into
  willing service (Matt 5:41).
  - It's not just _what_ we do, but the _spirit_ in which we do it.
  - [Whiteboard: 1st Mile = External Compliance | 2nd Mile = Internal
    Transformation]
- **The Nature of Compulsion Today:** What 'compels' us today?
  (Responsibilities, expectations, needs around us). **(RQ)**
  - How do we respond when life demands more than we initially planned to give?
    (Time, energy, patience).
- **The Principle:** God calls us to exceed the world's standard of minimum
  requirement (Matt 5:47).
  - This isn't about earning salvation, but reflecting the grace we've received.
  - **Illustration:** Think of paying taxes versus giving a voluntary gift.
    Taxes are the first mile – required, often done grudgingly. The second mile
    is like choosing to give generously beyond what's required, motivated by
    love or care, not compulsion.
  - [Write Question on Board (from Matt 5:41): What does 'going twain' look like
    in my daily interactions?]

### Section 2: Second-Mile Service & Love (Luke 14:12-14; Matt 5:43-48; Matt 18:21-22) [*] (12 min)

- **Active, Willing Service:** True service isn't passive attendance; it's
  active participation.
  - Read Luke 14:12-14. Who does Jesus tell us to serve? Those who cannot repay.
  - [Whiteboard: Serve Those Who Cannot Repay (Luke 14:13-14)]
  - Serving when inconvenient, tiring, using personal resources (time, skills,
    finances) for God's mission, not just our own circle.
  - **(RQ)** How often do our service choices prioritize those who can benefit
    us in return, versus those highlighted in Luke 14?
- **Love Beyond Limits:** The second mile radically redefines love.
  - Read Matthew 5:43-48. The standard is love for enemies, persecutors. This is
    far beyond the 'first mile' of loving those who love us.
  - [Whiteboard: 2nd Mile Love = Enemies, Strangers, Marginalized (Matt 5:44,
    46)]
  - Practical focus: Poor, addicts, handicapped, different races/religions,
    backsliders, the fallen – those society often overlooks.
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... They are
    like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of
    heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture, especially in how we
    welcome the 'least of these' (Matt 25:40).]
- **Unlimited Forgiveness:** A key aspect of second-mile love.
  - Read Matthew 18:21-22. Peter thought 7 times was generous! Jesus says
    seventy times seven – essentially, without limit.
  - [Whiteboard: Forgiveness = Unlimited (Matt 18:22)]
  - **(RQ)** Is there a limit to the grace God extends to us through Christ? How
    should that shape our forgiveness of others who wrong us?

### Section 3: Second-Mile Sacrifice & Giving (Mark 12:41-44; Matt 6:1-4) (10 min)

- **Sacrifice Beyond Surplus:** The second mile involves giving not just from
  abundance, but sacrificially.
  - Read Mark 12:41-44 (The Widow's Mites). Jesus contrasts her gift with the
    wealthy.
  - [Whiteboard: Rich = Gave from Abundance | Widow = Gave All Her Living (Mark
    12:44)]
  - **(RQ)** What does this passage teach about God's view of the _proportion_
    and _motive_ of our giving, rather than just the amount?
  - **Illustration:** Imagine two people giving $100. One earns $100,000/year
    (first mile giving, from surplus). The other earns $10,000/year (second mile
    giving, a real sacrifice). Jesus saw the widow's heart and sacrifice (Mark
    12:43).
- **Giving Without Seeking Reward:** Second-mile giving is done for God's glory,
  not human praise.
  - Read Matthew 6:1-4. Jesus warns against practicing righteousness _before
    men_ to be seen.
  - [Whiteboard: Secret Giving = Heavenly Reward (Matt 6:4)]
  - The focus is on the Father who sees in secret, not the applause of the
    crowd. This purifies our motives.
  - **(RQ)** How can we ensure our acts of service and giving are motivated by
    love for God and others, rather than a desire for recognition? (Matt 6:3)

### Section 4: The Example and the Empowerment (Phil 2:5-8) (5 min)

- **The Ultimate Second-Mile Saint:** Jesus Christ is our perfect example.
  - Read Philippians 2:5-8. He didn't cling to equality with God but emptied
    Himself, taking the form of a servant, obedient even to death on a cross.
  - [Whiteboard: Phil 2:5 - Have this MIND in you = Christ's Mind]
  - His entire life was a 'second mile' – going far beyond any obligation for
    our salvation.
- **Empowerment Through His Spirit:** We cannot live this second-mile life in
  our own strength.
  - It requires the "mind of Christ" (Phil 2:5) enabled by the Holy Spirit.
  - Acknowledging our dependence on God is key to walking the second mile.

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap Need/Question:** We are all on a journey. The question Jesus poses in
  Matt 5:41 challenges us: Are we settling for the minimum requirement (first
  mile), or are we embracing the call to go further in love, service,
  forgiveness, and sacrifice (second mile)?
- **Summarize Biblical Principle:** Jesus calls us beyond mere duty to reflect
  His own self-giving nature (Matt 5:41, Phil 2:5-8). This involves serving
  without expectation (Luke 14:12-14), loving enemies (Matt 5:44), forgiving
  limitlessly (Matt 18:22), giving sacrificially (Mark 12:44), and doing so with
  pure motives (Matt 6:1-4).
- **Bridging to Life:** Opportunities for second-mile living are everywhere: in
  our families, workplaces, churches, and communities. It's seen in small acts
  of kindness, patience when tested, serving when tired, forgiving when hurt.
- **Actionable Steps (Choose 1-2 this week):**
  1.  **Identify One:** Think of one person this week (neighbor, colleague,
      family member, stranger) you can serve or show kindness to _without
      expecting anything in return_, specifically because of Christ's call (Luke
      14:13-14).
  2.  **Practice Forgiveness:** Is there someone you need to forgive? Pray for
      the willingness to extend grace, remembering God's grace to you (Matt
      18:21-22). Take a step towards reconciliation if appropriate and safe.
  3.  **Give Sacrificially (Secretly):** Find one small way to give
      sacrificially (time, resource, encouragement) this week, doing it quietly
      for God's eyes only (Mark 12:44, Matt 6:3-4).
- **Gentle Invitation:** Let's ask God to give us the mind of Christ (Phil 2:5)
  and the strength to step onto the second mile, not out of obligation, but out
  of love for Him and the grace we have received. Let's choose discipleship over
  mere duty.
