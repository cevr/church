### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Relatable observation - Why do good intentions often fail? Why the
  universal struggle with selfishness, anger, etc.?
- Introduce concept: Sin as a spiritual "Fatal Infection" - inherited,
  pervasive, terminal if untreated.
- State Central Verse: Romans 5:12 - The origin and spread.
  `[Whiteboard: Title - Fatal Infection]`
  `[Whiteboard: Rom 5:12 - One Man -> Sin -> Death -> All Men]`
- Purpose of Study: To understand the biblical diagnosis of our condition and
  the only divine cure provided.

### Section 1: The Diagnosis - Universal Infection (10 min)

- **The Origin & Scope (Rom 5:12):**
  - Adam's transgression introduced sin/death.
  - Inherited condition: "death passed upon all men". We are born with a sinful
    nature. `[Whiteboard: Review Rom 5:12 diagram]`
- **Universal Reality (Rom 3:23):**
  - "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"
  - No exceptions based on birth, status, or effort.
    `[Whiteboard: Rom 3:23 = ALL Sinned]`
  - **(RQ)** Does this feel true to your own experience and observation of the
    world?
- **Human Incapacity:**
  - We are inherently infected and cannot cure ourselves.
  - Jeremiah 17:9 - "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
    wicked: who can know it?"
  - **(RQ)** If our core is compromised, can self-improvement truly cure the
    infection?
    `[Analogy (from Rom 5:12): Like an inherited genetic disorder - didn't choose it, but the condition exists and needs external intervention.]`

### Section 2: The Prognosis & The Provided Cure (12 min) [*]

- **The Prognosis (Rom 6:23a):**
  - "For the wages of sin is death..."
  - This isn't just physical death, but spiritual separation from God, the
    source of life.
    `[Whiteboard: Rom 6:23a -> Sin = Spiritual Death (Separation)]`
- **God's Foreknowledge & Love (John 3:16):**
  - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son..."
  - The cure wasn't an afterthought; it was rooted in God's eternal love and
    plan.
  - Revelation 13:8 - Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.
    `[Whiteboard: John 3:16 -> God's LOVE = The Motivation]`
- **The Divine Cure Provided (Rom 6:23b):**
  - "...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
  - Jesus Christ: His perfect life fulfilled the law, His death paid the
    penalty. `[Whiteboard: Rom 6:23b -> GIFT = Eternal Life THROUGH CHRIST]`
    `[Draw simple diagram: Cross bridging gap between 'Man (Sin/Death)' and 'God (Life)']`
- **Aside:** \*"Think about it: God didn't just offer advice from afar; He
  entered our infected world, lived perfectly among us, and took the fatal blow
  Himself on the cross. That's not just a cure; it's divine love in action,
  meeting us exactly where we are."

### Section 3: Receiving the Cure - Grace & Righteousness (12 min)

- **How is the Cure Received? (Eph 2:8-9):**
  - "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is
    the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
  - Grace = Unmerited favor + Divine power.
  - Faith = Trusting in/receiving God's provision.
    `[Whiteboard: Eph 2:8-9 -> GRACE (Unmerited) + FAITH (Trust) = SALVATION (Gift)]`
  - **(RQ)** Why is it crucial that salvation is a gift, not something earned?
- **The Result of Receiving (Rom 5:17):**
  - "For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which
    receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in
    life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
  - Shift from being ruled by sin/death to reigning in _life_ through Christ.
    `[Whiteboard: Rom 5:17 -> Receive Grace/Righteousness = REIGN IN LIFE]`
- **Holiness - Living Cured:**
  - Not self-achieved perfection, but a result of relationship.
  - John 15:4-5 - "Abide in me, and I in you... without me ye can do nothing."
  - Holiness is the fruit of connection with Christ, not the root of acceptance.
    `[Whiteboard: Holiness = Abiding in Christ (John 15:4-5), NOT Self-Effort]`
  - **(RQ)** Are our spiritual efforts focused on _earning_ God's favor, or on
    _connecting_ with the One who freely gives it?

### Conclusion: Living Cured - Looking to Jesus (6 min)

- **The Daily Necessity (John 1:29):**
  - "The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb
    of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."
  - Constant focus on Jesus is key to overcoming the infection's lingering
    effects. `[Whiteboard: John 1:29 -> Daily Focus: BEHOLD THE LAMB]`
- **The Essential Practice (EGW Concept):**
  - We must continually look away from self and unto Jesus, the Lamb of God. He
    is the one who takes away sin. Our strength, our righteousness, our hope is
    found only in Him. [Presenter can elaborate based on specific EGW quotes
    like those in Steps to Christ, Ch. 8].
- **Practical Steps (Derived from studied verses):**
  `[Whiteboard: Action Steps]`
  1.  **Acknowledge:** Honestly admit the diagnosis (Rom 3:23, 5:12).
  2.  **Accept:** Receive the free gift of cure - Christ's righteousness (Eph
      2:8-9, Rom 6:23b).
  3.  **Abide:** Cultivate daily connection with Jesus through prayer and study
      focused on Him (John 15:4-5).
  4.  **Behold:** Intentionally fix your focus on Jesus, the Lamb of God (John
      1:29).
- **Final Appeal:**
  - The diagnosis is serious, but the cure is freely offered.
  - Will you accept God's loving provision today?
  - Choose to receive the gift, abide in the relationship, and live in the
    freedom Christ offers from this fatal infection.
