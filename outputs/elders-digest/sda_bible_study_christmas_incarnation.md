### Introduction (5 min)

*   Welcome & Prayer
*   Beyond the Tinsel: What is the core message we celebrate?
*   Introducing the profound mystery: God becoming human.
*   Central Question: Why did the eternal God step into time and flesh? **(RQ)**
*   Overview: We'll explore John 1 and 1 John 4 to understand the *who*, *what*, and *why* of the Incarnation.
*   [Write on board: John 1:14 - The Word Became Flesh]

### Section 1: The Eternal Word (John 1:1-3) (8 min)

*   **Who Was Born in Bethlehem?**
    *   Reading John 1:1-3.
    *   Point 1: Pre-existence - "In the beginning was the Word..." (v. 1a)
        *   Not *a* beginning, but *the* beginning. He existed *before* creation.
        *   [Write on board: WORD (Logos) = Jesus]
    *   Point 2: Divinity - "...the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (v. 1b)
        *   Distinct yet unified. A core truth about the Godhead.
        *   How does this challenge simplified views of Jesus? **(RQ)**
    *   Point 3: Creator - "All things were made by him..." (v. 3)
        *   The baby in the manger is the Creator of the universe.
        *   [Whiteboard: Pre-existent -> Divine -> Creator (John 1:1-3)]
*   Significance: The one born was no mere human, but God Himself entering His creation.

### Section 2: The Incarnation Event (John 1:14) (10 min) [*]

*   **The Great Condescension**
    *   Reading John 1:14a - "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us..."
    *   [Whiteboard: INCARNATION = God in Human Flesh]
    *   Meaning of "dwelt" (eskēnōsen) - Tabernacled among us. God pitching His tent with humanity.
        *   Connection to Old Testament Tabernacle - God's presence made accessible.
    *   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Christ's incarnation was the ultimate embassy.
    *   Point 1: Tangible Reality - God wasn't distant; He became touchable, relatable (1 John 1:1).
    *   Point 2: Revelation - "...we beheld his glory... full of grace and truth." (v. 14b)
        *   Jesus is the perfect revelation of the Father's character.
        *   What does it mean to see God's glory in Jesus? **(RQ)**
*   Simplicity Revealed: The infinite God confined Himself to finite humanity to reach us.

### Section 3: The Purpose - Love & Atonement (1 John 4:10, Heb 2:14-17) (10 min)

*   **Why Did He Come?**
    *   **Purpose 1: To Declare & Demonstrate God's Love**
        *   Reading 1 John 4:10 - "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son..."
        *   God's love is the *source*, not the response.
        *   [Whiteboard: God's Love -> Incarnation (1 John 4:10)]
        *   The Incarnation itself is the ultimate proof of love – God pursuing humanity.
        *   [Analogy (from text): Like a rescuer entering a dangerous place not because those trapped called, but because the rescuer loved them.]
    *   **Purpose 2: To Provide Atoning Sacrifice**
        *   Connecting 1 John 4:10b: "...to be the propitiation for our sins."
        *   Reading Hebrews 2:14-17 - He partook of flesh and blood to... destroy the devil, deliver us, be a merciful High Priest, make propitiation.
        *   [Whiteboard: Incarnation -> Identification (Heb 2:14) -> Atonement (Heb 2:17)]
        *   Linking Birth and Death: Christmas points directly to the Cross. He was born *to* die.
        *   Why did He *have* to become human to atone for sin? **(RQ)** (Heb 2:17 - merciful high priest, make propitiation *for the people*)
*   The Need: Our sin separated us (Isaiah 59:2). The Solution: God Himself bridging the gap through Jesus.

### Section 4: The Response - Freedom & Love (1 John 4:11-12) (7 min)

*   **Receiving the Gift**
    *   Point 1: Acceptance Brings Freedom
        *   Accepting Christ (John 1:12) means receiving forgiveness based on His sacrifice (propitiation - 1 John 4:10).
        *   Freedom from sin's guilt and power.
        *   [Whiteboard: Accept Christ -> Forgiveness -> Freedom]
    *   Point 2: Compelled to Love
        *   Reading 1 John 4:11-12 - "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another... If we love one another, God dwelleth in us..."
        *   God's love isn't just received; it's transformative and overflows.
        *   How does understanding the depth of God's love in the Incarnation change how we see others? **(RQ)**
    *   **Bridging to Practice:**
        *   The love demonstrated at Christmas isn't seasonal; it's the pattern for Christian life.
        *   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed.
    *   **Actionable Steps (derived from 1 John 4:11-12):**
        *   1. Reflect daily: How did God show love to me *today* through Christ? (Connect to Incarnation's ongoing reality via Holy Spirit).
        *   2. Identify one person this week to show deliberate, Christ-like love (patience, service, forgiveness).
        *   3. Pray for God's love to *dwell* in you, making love for others natural, not forced.
        *   [Whiteboard: Action: Reflect -> Identify -> Pray (1 John 4:11-12)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

*   Summary: The baby in the manger was the eternal, divine Creator, who became flesh to demonstrate immeasurable love and provide the sacrifice for our sins.
*   The Simplicity: God came *to us* because He loves us.
*   The Invitation:
    *   Have you personally accepted this Gift? Received the forgiveness and freedom He offers? (John 1:12)
    *   If yes, are you allowing His love to flow *through* you to others? (1 John 4:11)
*   Final Thought: Let the truth of the Incarnation – God with us – transform not just our holidays, but our entire lives.
*   Call to reflect on God's love and commit to sharing it.
*   Closing Prayer
