### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: The most solemn, pivotal day in ancient Israel's religious calendar. Why
  was it so crucial? (Lev 23:27-29)
- Introduce Leviticus 16: The Divine Blueprint for Atonement.
- Purpose: To understand the three key rites of this day and their profound,
  ongoing significance for God's people today.
- Central Verse: Lev 16:30.
  `[Write on board: Lev 16:30 - Cleansing from ALL sins BEFORE THE LORD]`
- Overview: We'll explore:
  1.  The Priest's Personal Preparation.
  2.  The Cleansing Blood of the Lord's Goat.
  3.  The Final Banishment via the Scapegoat.

### Rite 1: The Priest Prepares (10 min)

- **Foundation:** Personal Consecration Precedes Ministry.
- Scripture Focus: Leviticus 16:3, 6, 11. `[Read/Summarize]`
  - High Priest brings a bullock for _his_ sin offering.
  - Makes atonement for _himself_ and _his house_ first.
- `[Write on board: RITE 1: Priest -> Atones for Self & House (Lev 16:6, 11)]`
- Significance: Underscores the absolute necessity of personal holiness and
  rightness with God before ministering or representing Him. Cannot lead others
  effectively without personal consecration.
- **(RQ)** How seriously do we take our own spiritual preparation before trying
  to help others? (cf. Matt 7:3-5)
- Contrast/Fulfillment: Jesus, our High Priest, was inherently sinless (Heb
  4:15, 7:26-27), needing no sacrifice for Himself, perfectly fulfilling this
  type.
- Application: Emphasizes the need for ongoing personal heart-searching,
  confession, and reliance on Christ's righteousness in our own lives. (1 John
  1:9). `[Whiteboard: Personal Need -> 1 John 1:9 (Confess/Cleanse)]`

### Rite 2: The Lord's Goat & Sanctuary Cleansing (15 min) [*]

- **Foundation:** Atonement for the People & Purification of the Sanctuary.
- Scripture Focus: Leviticus 16:15-19. `[Read/Summarize]`
  - Lord's Goat slain as sin offering _for the people_.
  - Blood taken _inside the veil_ (Most Holy Place).
  - Sprinkled on/before the mercy seat.
  - Cleanses the Holy Place from the uncleanness/transgressions of Israel.
- `[Write on board: RITE 2: Lord's Goat -> Blood -> Cleanses Sanctuary (Lev 16:16, 19)]`
- Explanation: Throughout the year, confessed sins were symbolically transferred
  _to_ the sanctuary via daily sacrifices. The Day of Atonement ritually
  cleansed the sanctuary _from_ these accumulated records of sin.
- `[Draw simple flow: Sinner -> Daily Sacrifice -> Priest -> Sin Transferred TO Sanctuary]`
- `[Draw Day of Atonement flow: High Priest -> Most Holy Place -> Blood Applied -> Sin Cleansed FROM Sanctuary]`
- **The Antitype: Heavenly Sanctuary Cleansing**
  - Scripture Focus: Hebrews 9:23-24. `[Read]` - Necessary for heavenly things
    to be purified.
  - `[Whiteboard: Heb 9:23-24 -> Heavenly Sanctuary Cleansed by Christ's Blood]`
  - Scripture Focus: Daniel 8:14. `[Read]` - "Unto two thousand and three
    hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
  - `[Write on board: Dan 8:14 -> 2300 Years -> Ends 1844 -> Heavenly Sanctuary Cleansing Begins (Investigative Judgment)]`
  - Explanation: Since 1844, Christ, our High Priest, has been engaged in the
    final phase of His atoning work – the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary.
    This involves an examination (judgment) of the records of all who have
    professed faith in God.
  - **(RQ)** If Christ is reviewing our life records now, how does this motivate
    us towards deeper faith and obedience? (cf. 2 Cor 5:10)
  - `[Aside: This judgment isn't arbitrary; it's like heaven's final audit, confirming who has truly accepted and lived by Christ's saving grace, vindicating God's character before the universe.]`
  - Connection to God's Desire: This process reflects God's desire for thorough
    cleansing (Lev 16:30) and heart purity (Mt 5:8).
    `[Whiteboard: Goal -> Mt 5:8 (Pure Heart)]`

### Rite 3: The Scapegoat (Azazel) (8 min)

- **Foundation:** Final Disposition and Banishment of Sin.
- Scripture Focus: Leviticus 16:10, 20-22. `[Read/Summarize]`
  - _After_ atonement/cleansing is complete.
  - High Priest confesses _all_ the iniquities/transgressions of Israel over the
    live goat's head (Azazel).
  - Goat sent away into the wilderness, bearing the sins.
- `[Write on board: RITE 3: Scapegoat (Azazel) -> Bears Confessed Sins -> Banished (Lev 16:21-22)]`
- Crucial Distinction: Azazel is _not_ a sacrifice for sin (no shedding of blood
  for atonement). The Lord's goat accomplished the atonement.
- **(RQ)** Why is it important that sins are placed on Azazel _after_ atonement
  is made?
- Identification: Azazel represents Satan, the originator of sin.
  - `[Whiteboard: Azazel = Satan (Instigator of Sin)]`
- Prophetic Link: Typifies the final stage where Satan bears ultimate
  responsibility for all sin he instigated. His final confinement and
  destruction (Rev 20:1-3, 7-10).
  - `[Write: Rev 20:1-3, 10 -> Satan Bears Sin -> Final Punishment]`
- `[Metaphor (from Lev 16): Like court proceedings: Christ (Lord's Goat) pays the penalty and clears the faithful; Satan (Azazel) is finally sentenced as the ultimate cause.]`

### Conclusion: Living in the Antitypical Day of Atonement (7 min)

- Recap: Three vital rites revealing God's plan:
  1.  Personal Preparation (Priest).
  2.  Atoning Blood & Sanctuary Cleansing (Lord's Goat / Christ's Ministry).
  3.  Final Accountability & Banishment of Sin (Scapegoat / Satan).
- The Present Truth: We are living _now_ in the great antitypical Day of
  Atonement, the time of heavenly sanctuary cleansing since 1844. (Ref. EGW, GC
  Ch. 23, 28; 5T 520).
- `[Write on board: CURRENT TIME = Antitypical Day of Atonement (Since 1844)]`
- Implication: This is a time demanding spiritual alertness, deep humility,
  thorough examination of our hearts, confession, and putting away every known
  sin through Christ's power. (Lev 23:29 - Afflict your souls).
- **(RQ)** Does our daily life reflect the solemnity and importance of this
  period of Christ's ministry?
- `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture, especially during this time of judgment.]`
- Call to Action:
  1.  **Study:** Diligently study the Sanctuary message and its meaning (Heb
      8:1-2).
  2.  **Surrender:** Daily confess sins and claim Christ's cleansing blood (1
      John 1:9).
  3.  **Seek Purity:** Pray for and cultivate heart purity, allowing the Holy
      Spirit to transform character (Mt 5:8; Ezek 36:26-27).
  4.  **Cooperate:** Actively cooperate with Christ's work of cleansing by
      turning from sin and embracing His righteousness.
- Final Appeal: Christ stands ready as our High Priest to cleanse us completely
  (Lev 16:30). Let us respond fully to His ministry during this crucial time,
  preparing our hearts to meet Him without spot or wrinkle when He returns.
