### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- The Unseen Reality: Briefly mention the Great Controversy theme – a cosmic
  conflict behind world events, impacting each of us. (Ref. _The Great
  Controversy_, Intro/Chap 29)
- Introducing the Key Players: Not just nations or people, but spiritual forces
  at work. (Ref. Eph 6:12)
- Focus Text: Revelation 12 provides a symbolic overview of this conflict, from
  heaven to earth.
- Central Question: Who is this enemy described, and crucially, how do we find
  victory over his influence in our lives? **(RQ)**
- [Write on board: The Great Controversy - Rev 12]
- Read Central Verse: Revelation 12:11 - This verse holds the key to our
  victory.

### Section 1: Identifying the Enemy (10 min)

- **Who is the Adversary?**
  - Scripture: Revelation 12:9 - "And the great dragon was cast out, that old
    serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he
    was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him."
  - **His Names Reveal His Nature:**
    - Dragon: Power, fierceness (Rev 12:3-4)
    - Old Serpent: Deception, linked to Eden (Gen 3:1)
    - Devil (Diabolos): Slanderer, Accuser
    - Satan: Adversary, Opponent
    - [Write on board: Dragon | Serpent | Devil | Satan]
  - **His Primary Work:** Deception ("deceiveth the whole world" - Rev 12:9).
    How does deception work subtly in our lives today? **(RQ)**
  - **His Other Title:** The Accuser.
    - Scripture: Revelation 12:10 - "...for the accuser of our brethren is cast
      down, which accused them before our God day and night."
    - He constantly points out our flaws and sins before God and to ourselves.
      (cf. Job 1:6-11, Zech 3:1)
    - [Aside: Think about it – accusation focuses on the past, on failures.
      God's conviction leads to repentance and focuses on the future, on
      restoration.]
- **His Status:** Cast Down.
  - He lost his place in heaven (Rev 12:9).
  - His ultimate defeat was secured at the cross (John 12:31).
  - He knows his time is limited (Rev 12:12).

### Section 2: The Reality of the Battle [*] (12 min)

- **The Enemy's Reaction:**
  - Scripture: Revelation 12:12 - "Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that
    dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the
    devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he
    hath but a short time."
  - He acts with "great wrath" precisely _because_ he knows his time is short.
    Desperation fuels his attacks.
  - This explains the intensity of temptation and spiritual struggle we
    sometimes face.
- **The Nature of Our Warfare:**
  - Scripture: Ephesians 6:11-12 - "Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may
    be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we wrestle not against
    flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the
    rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high
    places."
  - Our real battle isn't with people, but with unseen evil forces. (Eph 6:12)
  - [Write on board: Wrestle: Not Flesh & Blood -> Principalities, Powers]
  - We need divine equipment ("whole armour of God" - Eph 6:11) to stand against
    his strategies ("wiles").
  - **Illustration:** Like fighting the wind. You can't see the wind itself, but
    you see its effects (trees bending, dust blowing) and feel its force.
    Spiritual battles are similar – we see the effects (temptation,
    discouragement, conflict) even if the source is unseen. We need more than
    human strength to stand.
- **The Battleground:** Often, it's the mind – deception (Rev 12:9), accusation
  (Rev 12:10), discouragement. (cf. 2 Cor 10:4-5)

### Section 3: Our Friend and Our Victory (12 min)

- **The Source of Victory:** Not our strength, but Christ's provision.
  - Re-read Central Verse: Revelation 12:11 - "And they overcame him by the
    blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not
    their lives unto the death."
  - [Write on board: Victory Keys (Rev 12:11): 1. Blood 2. Testimony 3.
    Commitment]
- **Key 1: The Blood of the Lamb**
  - This refers to Jesus' sacrifice, His atonement on the cross. (cf. 1 Pet
    1:18-19, Eph 1:7)
  - How does His blood overcome the Accuser? **(RQ)** It cleanses us from sin (1
    John 1:7, 9), removing the basis for Satan's accusations. It demonstrates
    God's justice and mercy.
  - [Aside: The term "Lamb" is used nearly 30 times in Revelation for Jesus,
    emphasizing His sacrifice as the core of salvation and victory.]
- **Key 2: The Word of Their Testimony**
  - Sharing what God has done for us personally. (cf. Mark 5:19)
  - Testimony confirms the power of the blood in a life changed. It pushes back
    darkness and encourages others.
  - It's not about eloquence, but authenticity about God's work.
- **Key 3: Loved Not Their Lives Unto the Death**
  - Total commitment to Christ, valuing Him above earthly life and comfort. (cf.
    Luke 14:26-27, Phil 1:21)
  - This breaks the power of Satan's threats (persecution, loss) and temptations
    (worldly gain). If Christ is everything, what can Satan truly take away?
    **(RQ)**
- **Our Ally: More Than a Commander**
  - Scripture: John 15:15 - "Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant
    knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all
    things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you."
  - Jesus doesn't just give orders; He shares His heart and purpose with us. He
    fights _with_ us and _for_ us.
- **The Power Within:**
  - Scripture: 1 John 4:4 - "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome
    them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
  - The Holy Spirit residing in the believer is infinitely more powerful than
    Satan. Victory isn't just positional; it's experiential through His power.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We face a real enemy, Satan, the Deceiver and Accuser (Rev
  12:9-10). The battle is spiritual, intense because his time is short (Rev
  12:12, Eph 6:12). But victory is absolutely assured!
- **The Path to Victory (Recap Rev 12:11):**
  - **Need:** We feel the weight of accusation, the struggle against temptation,
    the reality of spiritual warfare.
  - **Biblical Principle:** Victory comes _only_ through reliance on Christ: His
    **Blood** cleanses and justifies, our **Testimony** declares His power, and
    our total **Commitment** breaks Satan's hold (Rev 12:11). We have a Friend
    in Jesus (John 15:15) and His power within us (1 John 4:4).
  - **Bridging:** Satan still accuses us today through thoughts of guilt,
    inadequacy, and past failures. He tempts us through worldly desires. But
    Christ's blood is sufficient _now_. Our testimony of His grace _today_ has
    power. Our commitment _now_ aligns us with the Victor.
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from Rev 12:11 & 1 John 4:4):**
  1.  **Claim the Blood:** When accused or tempted this week, consciously thank
      God for the blood of Jesus that cleanses you and gives you victory. Plead
      His merits.
  2.  **Share Your Testimony:** Pray for one opportunity this week to share
      something specific God has done for you, however small it seems.
  3.  **Renew Your Commitment:** In prayer, tell God you choose Him above all
      else, trusting the "Greater One" (1 John 4:4) within you for strength.
- **Invitation:** The victory described in Revelation 12:11 isn't just for
  martyrs of the past; it's for _us_, today. It's found by embracing Jesus
  Christ – His sacrifice, His friendship, His power. Will you choose today to
  walk in His victory, applying these principles in your life?
- Closing Prayer
