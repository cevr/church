vanquished And Christ is Lord indeed."

**Central Bible Verse:** 1 Corinthians 10:13 - "There hath no temptation taken

### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Temptation is a universal human experience. No one is immune.
- **Temptation vs. Sin:**
  - Being tempted is not inherently sinful (Heb 4:15).
  - Jesus Himself was tempted in all points like us, yet without sin.
  - [Whiteboard: Temptation ≠ Sin (Heb 4:15)]
  - (RQ) What comfort can we draw from knowing Jesus understands our struggles
    with temptation?
- **The Promise:** God provides a way of escape (1 Cor 10:13).
  - Introduce Central Verse.
  - Goal: To understand God's strategies for victory.

### Understanding Temptation (10 min)

- **The Danger of Self-Reliance:**
  - Pride leads to vulnerability (Prov 16:18).
  - Relying on our own strength guarantees failure.
  - (RQ) Why is acknowledging our weakness the first step towards strength in
    this battle?
- **Identifying the Sources:** Where does temptation come from?
  - Scriptural Basis: 1 John 2:16, Gal 5:17, Gen 3.
  - **1. The World (System):** External pressures, values contrary to God.
    - Lust of the eyes, pride of life (1 John 2:16).
    - [Whiteboard: Source 1: WORLD (System - 1 John 2:16)]
  - **2. The Flesh (Fallen Nature):** Internal desires, inclinations towards
    sin.
    - Lust of the flesh (1 John 2:16, Gal 5:17).
    - [Whiteboard: Source 2: FLESH (Nature - Gal 5:17)]
  - **3. The Devil (Enemy):** External, intelligent adversary.
    - Deception, accusation, direct assault (Gen 3, Matt 4, 1 Pet 5:8).
    - [Whiteboard: Source 3: DEVIL (Enemy - 1 Pet 5:8)]
  - [Brief Illustration Concept: Recognizing the distinct tactics needed for
    each source – like defending a city from external siege (world), internal
    spies (flesh), and direct assault (devil).]

### God's Provision for Victory [*] (12 min)

- **The Foundation: Not Human Strength, but Divine Power.**
  - Our efforts alone are insufficient (cf. Prov 16:18).
  - Victory is found _only_ through Jesus Christ.
  - [Whiteboard: Victory = Power of CHRIST]
- **Victory Over the World:**
  - Achieved through **Faith** (1 John 5:4).
  - What is this faith? Trusting in Jesus and His victory.
  - [Whiteboard: Strategy vs. World: FAITH (1 John 5:4)]
  - Looking unto Jesus (Heb 12:2) - Fixing our focus on Him, His sacrifice, His
    power.
  - (RQ) How does keeping our eyes on Jesus practically diminish the appeal of
    worldly temptations?
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our lives, as representatives of
    heaven, should reflect its values, not the world's. This focus inherently
    guards against worldly temptations by aligning our desires with God's
    kingdom.

### Practical Strategies from Scripture (13 min)

- **Strategy 1: FLEE from Fleshly Lusts.**
  - Scriptural Mandate: 1 Cor 6:18 (immorality), 1 Cor 10:14 (idolatry), 2 Tim
    2:22 (youthful lusts).
  - Biblical Example: Joseph (Gen 39:12) - Immediate, decisive action.
  - [Whiteboard: Strategy vs. Flesh: FLEE! (1 Cor 6:18, Gen 39:12)]
  - (RQ) What situations today demand immediate flight rather than engagement?
  - **Action Steps:** Identify personal triggers, avoid compromising
    places/media, establish clear boundaries.
- **Strategy 2: RESIST the Devil.**
  - Scriptural Mandate: James 4:7 - "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist
    the devil, and he will flee from you."
  - Requires active opposition, not passivity (Eph 4:27, 1 Pet 5:8).
  - [Whiteboard: Strategy vs. Devil: RESIST! (James 4:7)]
  - How to Resist:
    - Submit to God first (James 4:7a).
    - Use the Word of God (Matt 4:1-11 - Jesus' example).
      - [Whiteboard: Weapon: Word of God (Eph 6:17)]
    - Stand firm in faith, relying on Christ's authority and blood (Rev 12:11).
    - [Brief Analogy (from Matt 4): Jesus used specific scripture ('It is
      written...') to counter each specific temptation. We must know and apply
      God's Word specifically.]
  - (RQ) How does submitting to God empower our resistance against the enemy?
  - **Action Steps:** Daily prayer for strength, memorizing/speaking Scripture
    against specific temptations, refusing to give ground to Satan's lies.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** Temptation is universal, originates from world/flesh/devil, but God
  provides victory through Christ.
- **Key Strategies:** Faith (vs. World), Flee (vs. Flesh), Resist (vs. Devil).
- **The Ultimate Resource:** A close, abiding relationship with Jesus (John
  15:4-5).
  - [Whiteboard: Abide in Christ = Source of Strength (John 15:5)]
  - Without Him, we can do nothing.
- **Character Building:** Each victory, won through Christ's power, shapes us
  more into His image.
- **Last Generation Significance:** Overcoming sin through Christ is possible
  and part of God's plan for His final people (Rev 3:21).

  steadfastly in His power. Commit to walking in victory today.
