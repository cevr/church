### Introduction (5 min)

- Setting the Scene: Calvary - darkness, suffering, the weight of sin.
- The First Saying: Amidst agony, Jesus speaks – not a curse, but a prayer.
- Focus: Unpacking the depth of Luke 23:34 – His character, His mission, our
  response.
- [Write on board: Title & Luke 23:34a - "Father, forgive them..."]
- Why start with forgiveness for His tormentors? **(RQ)**

### Main Content 1: Christ's Character & Intercession (12 min)

- **The Prayer Itself:** "Father, forgive them..." (Luke 23:34a)
  - Demonstrates consistent prayerful nature, even under extreme duress (cf.
    Matt 26:39 - Gethsemane).
  - Reveals His heart – focused on reconciliation, not retribution.
- **Christ as Mediator/High Priest:**
  - Actively fulfilling His role _while_ making the sacrifice.
  - Hebrews 7:25: "Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
    come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them."
  - [Write on board: Luke 23:34a -> Intercession (Heb 7:25)]
  - His first act _on_ the cross (as recorded) is priestly intercession.
  - What does this immediate prayer teach about God's desire for sinners?
    **(RQ)**
- [Analogy (from Heb 7:25): Christ is like our perfect Advocate, pleading our
  case based on His own sacrifice, even when we are actively sinning.]

### Main Content 2: The Basis of the Plea - Ignorance [*] (10 min)

- **The Reason Given:** "...for they know not what they do." (Luke 23:34b)
  - What does this "ignorance" mean?
    - Not innocence or lack of responsibility.
    - A lack of full understanding of _Who_ He was and the cosmic significance
      of their actions.
  - [Write on board: Ignorance (Luke 23:34b) ≠ Innocence]
- **Biblical Parallels:**
  - Paul's Testimony: 1 Timothy 1:13 - "Who was before a blasphemer, and a
    persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly
    in unbelief."
    - [Write: 1 Tim 1:13 - Ignorance + Unbelief]
  - Peter's Sermon: Acts 3:17 - "And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance
    ye did it, as did also your rulers."
    - [Write: Acts 3:17 - Ignorance]
  - Ignorance doesn't negate guilt, but it highlights the need for enlightenment
    and repentance (Acts 3:19).
- How does understanding this 'ignorance' factor impact our view of God's mercy?
  **(RQ)**
- [Aside: We often act out of spiritual blindness, not fully grasping the
  consequences or the offense against God. Christ's plea covers this, urging us
  toward the light of truth and repentance.]

### Main Content 3: Universal Guilt & Universal Offer (12 min)

- **Who are "Them"?**
  - Immediately: Roman soldiers, Jewish leaders, the crowd.
  - Ultimately: All humanity.
  - DA p. 745: "Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity
    of us all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from the
    condemnation of the law."
  - [Write on board: "Them" (Luke 23:34) = Us All (DA 745)]
  - Our sins nailed Him there (cf. Isaiah 53:5-6).
- **The Universal Offer:**
  - The prayer wasn't just for those present, but for everyone implicated by
    sin.
  - DA p. 745: "His prayer for His enemies embraced the world. It took in every
    sinner who had lived or should live, from the beginning of the world to the
    end of time."
  - [Write: Prayer -> Embraced the World (DA 745)]
  - Forgiveness is freely offered through His sacrifice.
- **The Condition:**
  - The offer requires acceptance through repentance.
  - Acts 3:19: "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be
    blotted out..."
  - [Write: Forgiveness Offered -> Requires Repentance (Acts 3:19)]
  - If Christ prayed for _our_ forgiveness while _we_ were crucifying Him
    (through our sins), how should we respond to His offer today? **(RQ)**

### Conclusion & Application (6 min)

- **Summary:** Christ's first word from the cross is a profound revelation of
  His forgiving character, His priestly ministry, the nature of human guilt
  (even in ignorance), and the boundless scope of His offered grace.
- **The Call to Reflect Christ:**
  - We who have received such forgiveness are called to extend it.
  - Ephesians 4:32: "And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one
    another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."
  - [Write on board: Receive His Forgiveness -> Give Forgiveness (Eph 4:32)]
- **Practical Steps (derived from Luke 23:34 & Eph 4:32):**
  1.  **Acknowledge Need:** Recognize your own need for the forgiveness Christ
      prayed for (and purchased).
  2.  **Identify:** Who has wronged you? Who do you need to forgive, even if
      they acted 'in ignorance'?
  3.  **Pray:** Ask God for the grace to forgive them as Christ forgave you
      (Luke 23:34 model).
  4.  **Act:** Choose kindness and release bitterness, reflecting God's
      character (Eph 4:32).
- **Final Appeal:** Embrace the forgiveness offered at the cross. Let it
  transform you, and become a conduit of that same grace. Don't just talk about
  forgiveness; live it, empowered by the One who prayed it first.
