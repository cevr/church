### Introduction (5 min)
-   Greeting & Opening Prayer
-   Introduce the common phrase: "Trust in God, but tie your camel." Where does this idea fit biblically?
-   **The Need/Question:** How do we balance absolute reliance on God with our responsibility to act wisely and diligently? **(RQ)** Is faith passive waiting or active cooperation?
-   Introduce Central Verse (Joshua 2:1) - God promised victory (Josh 1:2-3), yet Joshua sends spies. Why?
-   Outline the study: Exploring the partnership between divine power and human responsibility through Scripture.
-   [Write on board: TRUST (God's Power) + DILIGENCE (Our Effort) = Biblical Faith]

### Section 1: The Command and the Commission (10 min)
-   **God's Promise:** Review God's clear promise to give Israel the land (Joshua 1:2-6, 9). Emphasis on God's initiative and power.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Joshua 1:9 - Be strong... the Lord thy God is with thee]`
-   **Joshua's Action:** Immediately follows with sending spies (Joshua 2:1a). This wasn't doubt, but responsible leadership.
    -   **The Biblical Principle (from text):** Trust in God's promise motivates, rather than negates, careful planning and action.
    -   **(RQ)** If God promised victory, why spy? Was Joshua lacking faith? Or demonstrating it?
-   **Using God-Given Abilities:** Faith involves using the intelligence, foresight, and skills God provides.
    -   Connect to Proverbs 16:3 - Committing works (actions based on thought/planning) to God allows Him to establish our thoughts/plans.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Prov 16:3 - Commit Works -> Thoughts Established]`
-   **Bridging to Practice:** How do we apply this when facing challenges God has promised to help us overcome (e.g., financial, health, relational)? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Divine Providence and Human Prudence (12 min) [*]
-   **God Goes Ahead:** The spies' mission immediately encounters God's prior work.
    -   They arrive at Rahab's house (Joshua 2:1b) - seemingly random, but providentially guided.
    -   Rahab's Confession (Joshua 2:8-11): She already knows about God's power and acts based on that knowledge. Her faith was based on hearing God's mighty acts.
        -   `[Whiteboard: Joshua 2:11 - Rahab's Faith: "He is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath."]`
    -   **The Biblical Principle (from text):** God is already working in unexpected people and places, preparing the way. Our diligence helps us discover His providence.
-   **Recognizing God's Hand:** The spies had to recognize Rahab's potential (discernment) and cooperate with God's leading (prudence).
    -   **(RQ)** How open are we to seeing God working outside our expected channels or plans?
    -   [Aside: Like finding hidden allies in unexpected territory, God often places resources and helpers where we least anticipate. Our job is often reconnaissance – finding where the Spirit is already moving.]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Effective mission/witness involves looking for where the Holy Spirit is *already* softening hearts or creating opportunities (like Rahab). Diligence in observation is key.
    -   `[Analogy (from text): Spies finding Rahab = Us finding receptive hearts prepared by the Spirit]`
-   **Actionable Step (Implied):** Pray for discernment to see where God is working *before* launching our own initiatives. Ask: Where are the "Rahabs" in my community/workplace?

### Section 3: Faith Expressed Through Diligent Action (12 min)
-   **Faith is Not Passive:** James makes it clear that genuine faith results in action.
    -   Read James 2:17-18 - "Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone... shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works."
    -   `[Whiteboard: James 2:17 - Faith + Works = Living Faith]`
    -   Rahab didn't just *believe* God was powerful (Joshua 2:11); she *acted* on that belief by hiding the spies and directing them (Joshua 2:4-6, 15-16). Her works demonstrated her faith.
    -   **(RQ)** What "works" in our lives demonstrate the reality of our faith? Are they evident?
-   **The Nehemiah Principle: Pray and Prepare:** Nehemiah faced opposition while rebuilding Jerusalem's walls. His response is a model.
    -   Read Nehemiah 4:9 - "Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Neh 4:9 - Prayer (Trust) + Watchfulness (Diligence) = Godly Strategy]`
    -   **The Biblical Principle (from text):** We couple dependence on God (prayer) with responsible action (setting a watch). Joshua trusted God *and* sent spies.
    -   [Aside: Think of a farmer. They trust God for sun and rain (providence), but they must plow, plant, and weed (diligence). One without the other yields no harvest. Faith without corresponding action is like expecting a harvest without planting.]
-   **Diligence as Stewardship:** Using the resources, time, and abilities God gives us is part of faithful living. Sending spies was Joshua using his leadership responsibility wisely.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** When facing spiritual warfare, church projects, or personal goals, how do we apply the "pray and set a watch" principle? **(RQ)** Are we praying *and* doing our part diligently?

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   **Summary:** We've seen in Joshua, Rahab, Nehemiah, and James that biblical faith is not passive resignation. It's active trust that leads to diligent, God-guided action. God promises victory, and our faith responds by stepping out, preparing, and working in cooperation with Him.
-   **Revisit Central Theme:** Joshua 2:1 shows a leader trusting God's promise (Josh 1) enough to take wise, practical steps (sending spies). Trust fuels diligence.
-   **Need/Question Answered:** We balance trust and action by letting God's promises *motivate* our diligent, Spirit-led efforts, recognizing His providence along the way.
-   **Biblical Principle Summary:** True faith works (James 2), prays *and* prepares (Neh 4), seeks God's guidance *and* uses God-given sense (Joshua 2), recognizing God is already at work (Rahab's testimony).
-   **Bridging:** This isn't just ancient history; it's our daily walk. Facing a challenge? Trust God's power AND make a wise plan (Prov 16:3). Starting a ministry? Pray for guidance AND do the research/preparation (Neh 4:9). Witnessing? Pray for openings AND look for the "Rahabs" God has prepared (Josh 2:11).
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from text):**
    1.  **Commit & Plan:** Identify one area where you need God's intervention. Commit it fully to God in prayer, asking for His established thoughts on the matter (Proverbs 16:3). Then, ask: What is one wise, diligent step *I* can take this week?
    2.  **Pray & Watch:** In facing challenges or pursuing goals, consciously adopt the Nehemiah principle: Pray fervently for God's help, *and* identify practical measures/precautions you need to take (Nehemiah 4:9).
    3.  **Look for Providence:** Actively look for unexpected ways God might already be working or providing help ("Rahabs") in your situation or mission field (Joshua 2:1, 11). Be ready to cooperate.
-   **Invitation:** God invites us into a dynamic partnership. He doesn't ask for blind passivity OR frantic self-reliance. He asks for active trust – faith that works diligently under His guidance. Will you commit today to embrace this partnership? To trust God fully, and then, empowered by that trust, to "do your homework" and act with wisdom and diligence as His Spirit leads?
