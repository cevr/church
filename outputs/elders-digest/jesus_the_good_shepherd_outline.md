### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Context: Jesus at the Feast of Dedication (John 10:22), following healing of
  blind man (John 9).
- Introduce Shepherd metaphor - common in OT (Psalm 23, Ezekiel 34), deeply
  resonant.
- Central Question: In a world of many voices, how do we identify and follow the
  _true_ Shepherd?
- State Central Verse: John 10:11 - The core identity and mission.
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & Central Verse: John 10:11]

### Section 1: The True Shepherd vs. Counterfeits (John 10:1-6) (10 min)

- **The Need:** Discerning truth from error, legitimate leadership from
  exploitation.
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:1-3):** The true shepherd enters by the door
  (legitimately), calls his own sheep by name, leads them out.
  - Contrast: Thieves/robbers climb in another way (illegitimate, harmful
    intent).
  - [Whiteboard: Draw simple sheepfold. Arrow IN via Door = Shepherd (v. 2).
    Arrow OVER WALL = Thief (v. 1)]
  - Point: Jesus implies the Pharisees are like the thieves/robbers (cf. John
    9:40-41).
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:4-5):** Sheep know _His_ voice; they flee from
  strangers.
  - Focus: Intimate recognition based on relationship.
  - [Whiteboard: Write: HIS VOICE (v. 4) -> FOLLOW | STRANGER'S VOICE (v. 5) ->
    FLEE]
  - **(RQ):** How familiar are we _personally_ with the Shepherd's voice through
    His Word and Spirit? (John 10:4)
- **Bridging to Practice:** We live amidst many 'voices' (media, culture, false
  teachings). How do we apply this discernment test today?
- **Actionable Step:** Commit to daily time in the Word to learn the Shepherd's
  voice (John 10:4). Test teachings against Scripture (Acts 17:11).

### Section 2: Jesus, The Exclusive Door (John 10:7-10) [*] (10 min)

- **The Need:** Understanding the _only_ way to true salvation and belonging.
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:7, 9):** Jesus explicitly states, "I am the
  door."
  - Significance: Exclusive access to the Father, the fold (safety), and
    salvation.
  - [Whiteboard: Write: JESUS = THE DOOR (John 10:9)]
  - **(RQ):** Why is the idea of an _exclusive_ door sometimes difficult, yet
    biblically essential? (cf. Acts 4:12)
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:9b):** Through Him: Salvation ("saved"),
  Security ("go in and out"), Provision ("find pasture").
  - [Whiteboard: Under "JESUS = THE DOOR": -> Salvation -> Security -> Provision
    (Pasture)]
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:10):** Contrast: Thief (destroy) vs. Jesus
  (abundant life).
  - Focus: The _quality_ of life Jesus offers – spiritual richness, purpose,
    relationship with God.
  - [Aside: "Abundant life isn't just about length of days or material wealth,
    which the thief might mimic falsely. It's the depth of connection to the
    Life-Giver Himself, something only the true Shepherd provides, starting now
    and lasting eternally."]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Many paths claim to offer fulfillment. Jesus claims
  to _be_ the only path to _true_, abundant life.
- **Actionable Step:** Reflect on what 'abundant life' means spiritually (John
  10:10). Choose daily to enter 'the Door' through prayer and reliance on
  Christ.

### Section 3: The Shepherd's Heart and Voice (John 10:11-15, 27-29) (12 min)

- **The Need:** Assurance of God's love, care, and security.
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:11, 15):** The Good Shepherd _lays down His
  life_ for the sheep.
  - Contrast: Hireling flees from danger (v. 12-13) – lacks genuine care.
  - Point: Ultimate sacrifice demonstrates ultimate love and ownership.
  - [Whiteboard: GOOD SHEPHERD (v. 11) -> LAYS DOWN LIFE vs. HIRELING (v. 12) ->
    FLEES]
  - **(RQ):** How does Christ's sacrifice personally impact our sense of worth
    and security? (John 10:11)
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:14-15):** Intimate, mutual knowledge: "I know my
  sheep, and am known of mine."
  - Connection to Father/Son relationship (v. 15).
  - [Illustration Concept (Biblical): David as shepherd knew his sheep (1 Sam
    17:34-36) - reflects Christ's intimate care.]
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:27-29):** Hearing His voice, Following Him ->
  Eternal Life, Absolute Security.
  - "Hear my voice" (v. 27) - Prerequisite for relationship and security.
  - "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish" (v. 28).
  - "Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand" (v. 28).
  - Reinforced by the Father's power (v. 29).
  - [Whiteboard: HEAR (v. 27) -> FOLLOW -> ETERNAL LIFE (v. 28) -> SECURE (No
    one plucks) (v. 28-29)]
  - **(RQ):** What practical steps help us 'hear' His voice daily amidst life's
    noise? (John 10:27)
- **Bridging to Practice:** Feeling lost or insecure? The Shepherd knows you by
  name (v. 3), died for you (v. 11), knows you intimately (v. 14), and holds you
  securely (v. 28-29).
- **Actionable Steps:** Practice listening for His voice in Scripture and prayer
  (v. 27). Consciously entrust anxieties to the One who holds you securely (1
  Peter 5:7, based on John 10:28-29).

### Section 4: One Flock, One Shepherd (John 10:16) [*] (3 min)

- **The Need:** Understanding the scope of God's saving plan.
- **Biblical Principle (John 10:16):** Jesus has "other sheep" (Gentiles) not of
  the Jewish fold.
  - He must bring them also.
  - Result: "One fold (flock), and one shepherd."
  - [Whiteboard: Jewish Fold + Other Sheep (Gentiles) => ONE FLOCK under ONE
    SHEPHERD (Jesus) (v. 16)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Challenges exclusivity or prejudice. The Gospel is
  for _all_.
  - [Aside: "Just as a shepherd cares for every single sheep, regardless of when
    it joined the flock, Christ's heart yearns for all to hear His voice. Our
    mission reflects His – seeking those 'other sheep' yet outside the fold."]
- **Actionable Step:** Pray for opportunities to share the Shepherd's call with
  someone new this week (Matt 28:19-20, inspired by John 10:16).

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: Jesus is the _True_ and _Good_ Shepherd (John 10:1-6, 11), the _only
  Door_ to salvation and abundant life (John 10:7-10).
- He offers an _intimate relationship_ (knowing His voice - v. 4, 14, 27) and
  _absolute security_ (laying down His life, holding us fast - v. 11, 15,
  28-29).
- His call extends to _all_ (v. 16).
- Final Emphasis: The simplicity and security found in hearing and following the
  Shepherd.
  - **(RQ):** Whose voice are you listening to? Is it the voice of the Good
    Shepherd? (John 10:27)
- Invitation: Choose today to listen for His voice in His Word, to enter through
  the Door, and to follow the Good Shepherd who laid down His life for you.
- Closing Prayer
