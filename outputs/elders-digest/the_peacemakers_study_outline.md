### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the Beatitudes series context (Sermon on the Mount - Kingdom principles).
- Read Central Verse: **Matthew 5:9**.
- Initial Question: What comes to mind when you hear "peacemaker"? Is it passive or active? **(RQ)**
- Briefly state goal: To understand the biblical call to *actively make* peace, rooted in Christ.
- [Write on board: Matthew 5:9 - Blessed = Peacemakers -> Children of God]

### Section 1: Defining the Peacemaker (7 min)
- **Not Just Peace-Lovers:** Emphasis on *making* peace (Greek: *eirēnopoios* - active). It's more than just avoiding conflict.
    - **Matt 5:9** - The blessing is for the *doers*, the agents of peace.
- **Biblical Peace (Shalom):** More than absence of conflict.
    - Includes wholeness, well-being, harmony, integrity, prosperity (spiritual & sometimes material). (cf. **Numbers 6:26**)
    - [Write on board: SHALOM = Wholeness, Harmony, Well-being]
    - How does this differ from the world's definition of peace (often just a truce)? **(RQ)**
- **Children of God:** Why this specific reward? (Reflecting the Father's character).
    - Peacemakers demonstrate kinship with the God of Peace (cf. **Rom 15:33**, **1 Thess 5:23**).
    - [Analogy (from Matt 5:9): Like a child resembling a parent, peacemakers reflect God's reconciling nature.]

### Section 2: The Foundation for Peacemaking (Beatitudes Link) (6 min) [*]
- **Building Blocks:** Peacemaking isn't the start; it builds on prior character traits developed through grace.
    - Briefly recap preceding beatitudes (**Matt 5:3-8**): Humility (poor in spirit), Repentance (mourn), Meekness, Hunger for Righteousness, Mercy, Purity of Heart.
    - How does lacking mercy or purity hinder peacemaking? **(RQ)** Can an impure heart truly desire God's *shalom* for others? **(RQ)**
    - [Write on board: Humility -> Repentance -> Meekness -> Righteousness -> Mercy -> Purity => Foundation for Peacemaking]
- **Internal State First:** True peacemaking flows from a heart transformed by God's grace (**Matt 5:3-8**), reflecting these qualities.

### Section 3: The Source & Nature of True Peace (8 min)
- **God, the Source:** Ultimate peace originates with God.
    - **1 Thess 5:23** (God of peace sanctify you)
    - **Galatians 5:22** (Peace as a fruit of the Spirit).
- **Peace *WITH* God:** The starting point – Reconciliation through Christ.
    - **Romans 5:1** - "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
    - [Write on board: Justification (Faith in Christ) -> Peace WITH God (Rom 5:1)]
    - This peace resolves the fundamental conflict caused by sin between humanity and God.
- **Peace *OF* God:** The internal result – A supernatural calm amidst trials.
    - **Philippians 4:7** - "And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
    - [Write on board: Indwelling Christ -> Peace OF God (Phil 4:7) -> Guards Heart/Mind]
    - How can we experience this peace when circumstances are chaotic? **(RQ)** (Requires surrender and trust - cf. **Isa 26:3**).

### Section 4: Christ, The Ultimate Peacemaker (7 min)
- **His Identity:** The Prince of Peace.
    - **Isaiah 9:6** - Prophecy of His title and eternal reign of peace.
    - **Luke 2:14** - Angels announce "peace on earth" at His birth, signifying the *availability* of peace through Him.
- **His Mission:** To restore the peace broken by sin.
    - **Isaiah 53:5** - "...the chastisement [punishment] for our peace was upon him..." (His suffering secured our *shalom*).
    - **Ephesians 2:14-16** - He *is* our peace, broke down the dividing wall (Jew/Gentile, God/Man) through His sacrifice.
    - [Draw simple diagram: Humanity <-> SIN (Wall) <-> God | Christ's Cross breaks wall -> Reconciliation (Eph 2:16)]
    - **Colossians 1:20** - Making peace through the blood of His cross, reconciling all things to God.
- **His Example:** He lived peaceably, sought reconciliation, yet stood firm for truth (**Matt 10:34** shows peace doesn't mean compromising truth).

### Section 5: Our Call to Active Peacemaking (7 min)
- **Mandate for Believers:** Reflecting Christ's work as His children (**Matt 5:9**).
    - **With Others:** **Romans 12:18** - "If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."
        - Requires effort, goodwill, seeking reconciliation, overlooking offenses where possible (**Prov 19:11**).
        - What does "as much as lieth in you" imply about limits? **(RQ)** (Integrity, truth cannot be compromised for false peace).
        - [Aside: Our homes and churches should be the primary training grounds for practicing Romans 12:18. If we can't foster peace there, our witness to the world is weakened.]
    - **Preventing Division:** Actively work against gossip, strife, disunity in the family and church (cf. **Prov 6:19**; **Eph 4:3** - "endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace").
    - **Ambassadors for Christ:** Facilitating reconciliation between God and humanity (**2 Cor 5:18-20**).
        - Sharing the gospel *is* peacemaking – offering peace *with* God through Christ.
        - [Write on board: Our Role: 1. Live Peaceably (Rom 12:18) 2. Guard Unity (Eph 4:3) 3. Share Gospel (2 Cor 5:18-20)]
    - **Quiet Witness:** A holy life reveals Christ's peace.
        - EGW Concept (MB p. 28): A consecrated life, revealing Christ's peace and love, is a powerful sermon.
        - [Aside: Sometimes the most effective peacemaking isn't loud intervention, but the quiet, consistent demonstration of God's peace in our own lives, drawing others towards its Source.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)
- **Recap:** Peacemaking is an active, Christ-like work (**Matt 5:9**), built on grace (**Matt 5:3-8**), sourced in God (**Gal 5:22**), demonstrated perfectly by Christ (**Eph 2:14**), and mandated for believers (**Rom 12:18**, **2 Cor 5:20**).
- **Reflection:** Are we merely peace-lovers, or are we actively *making* peace? Does our life first demonstrate peace *with* God (**Rom 5:1**) and the peace *of* God (**Phil 4:7**)? **(RQ)**
- **Challenge/Action Steps:**
    1.  Examine your heart: Are the foundational qualities (humility, mercy, purity) present?
    2.  Identify one relationship or situation where you can apply **Romans 12:18** this week.
    3.  Consider how sharing the gospel message is the ultimate act of peacemaking (**2 Cor 5:18-20**).
- **Invitation:** Let us embrace our calling as children of God by becoming active agents of His peace, starting within our own hearts and extending outward, all through the power of the Prince of Peace.
