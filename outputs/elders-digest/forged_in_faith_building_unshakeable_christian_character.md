### Introduction (6 min)
-   **Hook:** Briefly mention the story of the three Hebrews (Daniel 3) - a crisis revealing character.
-   **Introduce Topic:** Christian Character - not just reputation, but who we truly are, built from the inside out.
-   **Central Verse:** Read Daniel 3:17-18. This is the essence of faith-forged character.
    -   [Write on board: Character = Faith in Action (Dan 3:17-18)]
-   **The Need:** Why is solid character crucial, especially today? **(RQ)**
-   **Outline Flow:** We'll explore how faith (Heb 11:6) builds conviction (Ps 119:105), leads to consecration (Rom 12:1-2), empowers courage (Dan 3:17-18), fosters consistency (Gal 6:9), and results in integrity, vital for the last days (Rev 14:12).

### Section 1: Faith - The Unseen Foundation (8 min)
-   **The Need:** We live in a world demanding proof. How do we build on something unseen? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle:** Faith is essential to please God (Hebrews 11:6).
    -   Read Hebrews 11:6. What does it mean to *believe* He is, and is a rewarder? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: FAITH (Heb 11:6) = Believing God IS + Believing God REWARDS Diligent Seeking]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Faith isn't blind; it's trusting God's revealed Word and character above our senses or circumstances.
    -   [Analogy (from Heb 11): Faith like unseen foundation - supports the whole structure of our lives, even when storms come.]
-   **Actionable Steps (from Heb 11:6):**
    1.  Acknowledge God's existence and sovereignty daily.
    2.  Diligently seek Him through prayer and study, expecting Him to reward that seeking.
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: Seek God Diligently (Heb 11:6)]

### Section 2: Conviction & Consecration (10 min) [*]
-   **The Need:** The world constantly pressures us to conform. How do we stand firm?
-   **Biblical Principle 1: Conviction from the Word (Ps 119:105):** True convictions aren't feelings, but truths grounded in Scripture.
    -   Read Psalm 119:105. How does God's Word guide our convictions? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: CONVICTION SOURCE = God's Word (Ps 119:105), not Preference]
-   **Biblical Principle 2: Consecration & Non-Conformity (Rom 12:1-2):** Faith leads to dedicating our whole lives to God, resisting worldly molds.
    -   Read Romans 12:1-2. What does a 'living sacrifice' look like? **(RQ)** How does renewing the mind prevent conformity? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: CONSECRATION (Rom 12:1-2) = Living Sacrifice + Renewed Mind -> Non-Conformity]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Are our daily choices reflecting God's Word or the world's patterns? **(RQ)** Consecration means saying 'yes' to God even when it means saying 'no' to popular opinion or personal comfort.
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven (Rom 12:2), not the customs of the surrounding culture.
-   **Actionable Steps (from Rom 12:1-2, Ps 119:105):**
    1.  Identify one area where worldly pressure is strong; seek God's Word for guidance (Ps 119:105).
    2.  Begin each day consciously presenting yourself to God as a living sacrifice (Rom 12:1).
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: Filter Choices Thru Word (Ps 119:105), Daily Dedication (Rom 12:1)]

### Section 3: Courage & Consistency Under Pressure (10 min)
-   **The Need:** Standing for truth often involves facing opposition or trials.
-   **Biblical Principle 1: Divine Courage (Dan 3:17-18):** Faith fuels courage to obey God regardless of consequences.
    -   Re-read Daniel 3:17-18. Notice the structure: God *is able*, He *will* deliver (faith), *BUT IF NOT*... we *still* won't compromise (conviction/courage).
    -   [Write on board: COURAGE (Dan 3:17-18) = Trust in God's Power + Commitment Regardless of Outcome ("But if not...")]
    -   Where does this 'But if not...' faith come from? **(RQ)** (Answer: Prior relationship & conviction based on God's Word).
-   **Biblical Principle 2: Consistency (Gal 6:9):** Character is proven through persistent faithfulness, not occasional heroism.
    -   Read Galatians 6:9. Why is it easy to become weary? **(RQ)** What is the promise? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: CONSISTENCY (Gal 6:9) = Don't Grow Weary -> Reap if We Don't Faint]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** True character shines brightest under pressure. It's the result of small, consistent choices made *before* the crisis.
    -   [Illustration Concept (from Dan 3): Standing firm like the Hebrew worthies wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision. It required a pre-existing foundation of faith and conviction built daily.]
-   **Actionable Steps (from Dan 3:17-18, Gal 6:9):**
    1.  Identify a 'small' area of obedience you struggle with; pray for consistency (Gal 6:9).
    2.  Mentally rehearse your 'But if not...' commitment for potential future trials (Dan 3:18).
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: Practice Small Obedience (Gal 6:9), Prepare 'But If Not' Faith (Dan 3:18)]

### Section 4: Integrity & Last Day Faithfulness (6 min) [*]
-   **The Need:** In a world of superficiality, God looks at the heart. How do we cultivate integrity?
-   **Biblical Principle 1: Integrity (Prov 10:9):** Character involves wholeness – consistency between private life and public witness. *Note: Removed Ps 15:1-2 to keep focus tight for time.*
    -   Read Proverbs 10:9. What's the difference between walking securely and perverting one's ways? **(RQ)**
    -   [Write on board: INTEGRITY (Prov 10:9) = Walking Securely (Public = Private)]
    -   Who are we when no one is watching? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle 2: Association (Prov 13:20):** Godly character is strengthened by fellowship with others of like faith.
    -   Read Proverbs 13:20. How does our company shape our character? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle 3: Last Day Faithfulness (Rev 14:12):** The final test involves endurance built on faith and obedience.
    -   Read Revelation 14:12. What characterizes God's people in the end? **(RQ)** (Patience/Endurance, Faith of Jesus, Keeping Commandments).
    -   [Write on board: LAST DAYS (Rev 14:12) = Endurance + Faith + Obedience]
    -   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Our consistent character (Rev 14:12), built on faith, turns trials into opportunities for witness.
-   **Actionable Steps (from Prov 10:9, 13:20, Rev 14:12):**
    1.  Evaluate one private habit – does it align with public profession? (Prov 10:9)
    2.  Intentionally seek fellowship that encourages faithfulness (Prov 13:20).
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: Align Private/Public (Prov 10:9), Seek Godly Friends (Prov 13:20)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
-   **Summary:** True Christian character isn't self-generated. It's forged in the crucible of life *by faith* in God (Heb 11:6), grounded in His *Word* (Ps 119:105), leading to *consecration* (Rom 12:1-2), *courage* (Dan 3:17-18), *consistency* (Gal 6:9), and *integrity* (Prov 10:9), preparing us for Christ's return (Rev 14:12).
-   **Reiterate Central Message:** Like the Hebrew worthies, our commitment must be rooted in faith: "Our God whom we serve is able... But if not... we will not serve [idols]" (Dan 3:17-18). This is the essence of character that honors God above all else.
-   **Final Thought:** Building this kind of character is a lifelong process, empowered by the Holy Spirit as we cooperate with Him. It requires daily choices grounded in faith and God's Word.
-   **Appeal/Invitation:** Will you choose today to intentionally cultivate a character forged in faith? Will you commit to seeking God diligently (Heb 11:6), grounding your convictions in His Word (Ps 119:105), consecrating your life (Rom 12:1-2), and asking for the courage and consistency (Dan 3:17-18, Gal 6:9) to stand firm, reflecting His integrity (Prov 10:9) as we await His coming (Rev 14:12)? Let us rely on His strength to build lives that truly honor Him.
