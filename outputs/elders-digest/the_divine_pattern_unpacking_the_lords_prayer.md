### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: Common experience of reciting the prayer. **(RQ)** But do we grasp the depth Jesus intended?
-   Context: Given in Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5-7) - blueprint for kingdom living.
    -   Contrast with vain repetitions (Matt 6:7). Jesus offers substance over empty ritual.
-   Purpose: Not just words to recite, but a divine *pattern* for communion with God.
    -   [Write on board: Matthew 6:9 - "After this *manner*..."]
-   Focus: Unpacking this model phrase by phrase, revealing its profound simplicity and power for disciples today.

### Section 1: The Model & The Relationship - "Our Father" (8 min)

-   **The Address:** "Our Father which art in heaven" (Matt 6:9b)
    -   **Need/Question:** How do we approach the infinite God? What is our standing?
    -   **Biblical Principle:** God invites us into a family relationship through Christ.
        -   "Our": Unity, community of believers. Connects horizontally. [Whiteboard: OUR = Community (1 John 1:7)]
        -   "Father": Intimacy, dependence, trust, loving authority. Connects vertically. (Rom 8:15; Gal 4:6) [Whiteboard: FATHER = Relationship (Love, Trust, Authority)]
        -   "in heaven": His sovereignty, majesty, transcendence. Balances intimacy with reverence. (Isa 55:9)
    -   **Bridging:** **(RQ)** How does calling God "Father" change how we pray about our fears? How does "Our" challenge self-centered prayers?
    -   **Actionable Steps:** 
        1.  Begin prayer consciously acknowledging this relationship (Father).
        2.  Intentionally pray *with* and *for* fellow believers (Our).
    -   [Aside: Calling God 'Father' wasn't common before Christ revealed Him this way. It signifies a radical shift in access and relationship, made possible only through Jesus' sacrifice, restoring what was lost in Eden.]

### Section 2: God's Priority - Name, Kingdom, Will (12 min) [*]

-   **God's Name:** "Hallowed be thy name." (Matt 6:9c)
    -   **Need:** Right focus in worship and life.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Prioritizing God's honor, reputation, and character above all. (Ps 111:9; Ezek 36:23)
        -   "Hallowed": Set apart, revered, treated as holy.
        -   "Name": Represents His character, authority, presence. [Write on board: HALLOWED NAME = God's Character Revered (Ex 34:6-7)]
    -   **Bridging:** Our lives are a testimony. **(RQ)** Do our actions and attitudes reflect the holiness of the One we call Father? (Cf. Rom 2:24)
    -   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Seek to understand God's character through His Word.
        2.  Pray for His name/character to be honored in your life and the world.
        3.  Make choices that align with His holiness.

-   **God's Kingdom:** "Thy kingdom come." (Matt 6:10a)
    -   **Need:** Hope amidst world's chaos; understanding God's ultimate plan.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Praying for the establishment of God's reign - future (Christ's return - Rev 11:15) and present (in hearts, the church - Luke 17:21). [Whiteboard: KINGDOM COME = God's Reign (Future/Present)]
    -   **Bridging:** This is a prayer for the triumph of God's government of love. It implies allegiance. [Analogy: Like ambassadors representing their home kingdom while living abroad - 2 Cor 5:20].
    -   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Live as a loyal citizen of heaven now (Phil 3:20).
        2.  Share the Gospel (the good news of the Kingdom - Mark 1:15).
        3.  Pray expectantly for Christ's soon return.

-   **God's Will:** "Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven." (Matt 6:10b)
    -   **Need:** Submission and alignment with God's perfect purposes.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Seeking and submitting to God's revealed will (Scripture) and His providential will (circumstances), trusting His wisdom. (Ps 143:10; John 4:34; Heb 13:21) [Whiteboard: WILL BE DONE = Submission & Alignment (Ps 40:8)]
    -   **Bridging:** Heaven operates in perfect harmony with God's will. **(RQ)** What hinders that harmony on earth, especially in our own hearts? (Self-will, ignorance, rebellion).
    -   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Diligently study Scripture to know His revealed will.
        2.  Pray for strength to obey, especially when difficult (Cf. Jesus in Gethsemane - Matt 26:39).
        3.  Cultivate trust in His plan even when not fully understood.

### Section 3: Our Needs - Provision, Pardon, Protection (12 min)

-   **Provision:** "Give us this day our daily bread." (Matt 6:11)
    -   **Need:** Acknowledging dependence for physical and spiritual sustenance.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Trusting God as the source for daily needs, rejecting anxiety and hoarding. (Ex 16:4 - Manna; Matt 6:25-34; Phil 4:19) [Whiteboard: DAILY BREAD = Dependence (Physical/Spiritual - Deut 8:3)]
    -   **Bridging:** Covers physical necessities AND spiritual nourishment (Word of God - Matt 4:4). Promotes simplicity and trust over materialism. **(RQ)** Do we live like we truly depend on God day by day?
    -   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Pray specifically for daily needs with trust, not anxiety.
        2.  Practice gratitude for His provision.
        3.  Feed on God's Word daily for spiritual strength.

-   **Pardon:** "And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." (Matt 6:12)
    -   **Need:** Reconciliation with God and others; freedom from guilt and bitterness.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Receiving God's forgiveness (based on Christ's sacrifice - Eph 1:7) is vitally linked to our willingness to forgive others. (Matt 6:14-15; Matt 18:21-35; Col 3:13) [Whiteboard: FORGIVENESS = Received (Vertical) & Given (Horizontal) - *Draw arrows*]
    -   **Bridging:** This condition is challenging but crucial. Unforgiveness blocks fellowship. **(RQ)** Is there someone we need to forgive today to fully experience God's forgiveness?
    -   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Confess known sins specifically to God, claiming His promise (1 John 1:9).
        2.  By God's grace, choose to forgive those who have wronged you.
        3.  Pray for help to forgive when it feels impossible.
    -   [Aside: Forgiveness isn't excusing wrong or forgetting the pain, but releasing our claim for justice into God's hands. It breaks chains of bitterness, freeing *us* to reflect Christ's love.]

-   **Protection/Guidance:** "And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil [or the evil one]." (Matt 6:13a)
    -   **Need:** Guidance through life's trials and protection from Satan's power and snares.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Acknowledging our weakness and dependence on God for guidance away from compromising situations (temptation = testing/trial) and deliverance from the power of sin and Satan. (James 1:13; 1 Cor 10:13; John 17:15; 2 Thess 3:3) [Whiteboard: LEAD/DELIVER = Guidance (Avoid) & Protection (Overcome)]
    -   **Bridging:** God doesn't tempt to sin, but allows tests to refine character. We pray for wisdom to avoid needless trials and divine strength to endure necessary ones victoriously. **(RQ)** Are we actively cooperating with God by avoiding known danger zones?
    -   **Actionable Steps:**
        1.  Pray daily for discernment and strength against temptation.
        2.  Actively avoid situations and influences known to be spiritually dangerous.
        3.  Claim God's promises for deliverance when facing trials (1 Cor 10:13).
