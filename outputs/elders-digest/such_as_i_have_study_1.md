Jesus will come, For whom we have waited so long; O, soon we shall enter our
glorious home, And join in the conqueror's song."

### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the story of Peter and John at the Temple Gate (Acts 3:1-10).
- Focus on Peter's statement: "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have
  give I thee." (Acts 3:6)
- **Central Question:** What does it mean for us today to give 'such as we
  have'? **(RQ)**
- Brief overview: We'll explore biblical stewardship beyond just money, grounded
  in Christ's sacrifice.
- [Write on board: Acts 3:6 - "Such as I have..."]

### Section 1: What Do We Possess? (12 min)

- **The Need:** The lame man needed physical healing, representing humanity's
  deeper spiritual needs.
- **Peter's Offering:** Not money, but power in Christ's name. What was the
  source of this power? (Acts 3:6b)
- **Our Possessions:** What has God given _us_? (Time, talents, influence,
  resources, testimony, the Gospel message itself).
- **Biblical Principle (1 Peter 4:10):** "As every man hath received the gift,
  even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold
  grace of God."
  - We are _stewards_, not owners.
  - Gifts are diverse ("manifold grace").
  - Purpose: To serve _others_.
  - [Write on board: STEWARDSHIP (1 Pet 4:10) = Managing God's Gifts]
- **Bridging to Practice:** How often do we focus on what we _lack_ (like Peter
  lacking silver) instead of what we _have_ through Christ? **(RQ)**
- **Actionable Step:** Identify one specific 'gift' (skill, time slot, resource)
  you possess this week. How can you use it for someone else, reflecting God's
  grace? (Based on 1 Pet 4:10)
- [Aside: Like Peter at the gate, sometimes the most valuable thing we offer
  isn't what the world values (money), but the spiritual power and practical
  help God enables us to give.]

### Section 2: The Principle of Divine Ownership [*] (10 min)

- **The Question:** If everything is a gift, what is our responsibility
  regarding material resources?
- **Biblical Principle (Malachi 3:8-10):**
  - "Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we
    robbed thee? In tithes and offerings." (Mal 3:8)
  - Tithe (10%) is presented as God's owned portion, returning it is an act of
    acknowledging His ownership.
  - Offerings are gifts _beyond_ the tithe, given willingly.
  - [Write on board: Malachi 3:8-10 - Tithe (Acknowledgement) + Offerings
    (Worship)]
  - God's promise of blessing linked to faithfulness (Mal 3:10).
- **Connecting to 'Such As I Have':** Faithful stewardship of finances enables
  the church (the collective body) to minister effectively, supporting the work
  Peter did.
- **Bridging to Practice:** Is returning tithe and giving offerings seen as a
  duty or a recognition of God's total ownership and blessing? **(RQ)**
- **Actionable Step:** Review personal finances this week. Is there faithfulness
  in returning God's tithe as the foundation? How can offerings reflect
  gratitude for God's provision? (Based on Mal 3:10)
- [Analogy (from Mal 3:10): God asks us to test Him here – like opening the
  windows of heaven. It's an invitation to experience His faithfulness through
  our own.]

### Section 3: The Foundation of Sacrifice (12 min)

- **The Ultimate Example (Philippians 2:5-8):**
  - "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus..." (Phil 2:5)
  - Christ didn't cling to equality with God but emptied Himself, taking a
    servant's form, becoming obedient unto death (Phil 2:6-8).
  - [Write on board: Phil 2:5-8 -> Christ's Sacrifice = Our Pattern]
  - His sacrifice is the basis of our salvation and the motivation for our
    giving/service.
- **The Call to Discipleship (Matthew 16:24):**
  - "Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him
    deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
  - True discipleship involves self-denial and following Christ's sacrificial
    path.
  - Giving 'such as we have' often requires personal sacrifice (time, comfort,
    resources).
- **Connecting the Dots:** Stewardship isn't just managing resources; it's
  adopting Christ's self-sacrificing mindset (Phil 2:5) and obeying His call to
  self-denial (Matt 16:24).
- **Bridging to Practice:** Where does the principle of self-denial clash with
  modern culture's emphasis on self-fulfillment? How does Christ's example
  (Phil 2) reframe our priorities? **(RQ)**
- [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... territory
  that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the
  surrounding culture. Our collective giving supports this witness.]
- **Actionable Step:** Identify one area this week where you can practice
  intentional self-denial (e.g., time spent, a purchase forgone) to free up
  resources (time or money) for God's work or helping someone, following
  Christ's pattern (Matt 16:24, Phil 2:5).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Peter gave what he had – the power of Christ. We are called to do
  the same, stewarding _all_ God has given us (time, talents, resources,
  influence) based on His ownership (Mal 3) and Christ's sacrificial example
  (Phil 2).
- **The Core Truth:** True stewardship flows from a heart transformed by
  Christ's sacrifice, leading to joyful giving and service (1 Pet 4:10).
- **Final Thought:** What 'such as I have' will you give this week, in the name
  of Jesus Christ? It might be more powerful than silver or gold. **(RQ)**
- **Invitation:** Commit to God today to be a faithful steward, offering back to
  Him what He has so graciously given you, starting with your heart and
  extending to all you possess.
- Closing Prayer
