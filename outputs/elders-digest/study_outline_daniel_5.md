### Introduction (5 min)
*   Welcome & Opening Prayer
*   Setting the Scene: Babylon, decades after Nebuchadnezzar. Belshazzar's great feast (Dan 5:1).
*   Contrast: Height of worldly glory vs. impending divine judgment.
*   Central Theme: God's response to willful rejection of known truth and the reality of judgment.
*   [Write on board: Daniel 5 - Judgment on Willful Sin]
*   Brief overview of the story's flow.

### Section 1: Pride, Presumption, and Profanity (10 min)
*   **The Feast:** Describe the scene (Dan 5:1-4). Excess, revelry.
*   **The Desecration:** Using sacred temple vessels for pagan worship (Dan 5:2-3).
    *   [Write on board: Sacred Vessels -> Profane Use]
    *   Significance: Deliberate defiance against the God of Israel.
*   **The Ignored Lesson:** Belshazzar *knew* Nebuchadnezzar's story (Dan 5:18-22).
    *   Recap Nebuchadnezzar's pride, fall, and restoration (Dan 4).
    *   Belshazzar's sin was greater due to knowledge rejected (Dan 5:22).
    *   [Write on board: Knew Truth -> Chose Pride (Dan 5:22)]
    *   RQ: How dangerous is it to know God's requirements but choose to ignore them? (RQ)
*   **Application:** Danger of presumption, pride, treating sacred things lightly (God's Word, Sabbath, body temple - 1 Cor 6:19-20).

### Section 2: The Uninvited Guest and the Unreadable Message (10 min)
*   **The Handwriting:** The fingers appear, writing on the plaster (Dan 5:5).
    *   [Write on board: Divine Intervention -> The Writing]
*   **The King's Terror:** Fear replaces revelry (Dan 5:6). Physical reaction.
*   **Worldly Wisdom Fails:** Astrologers, Chaldeans cannot read or interpret (Dan 5:7-9).
    *   RQ: Why does human wisdom consistently fail before divine revelation? (RQ)
*   **Daniel Remembered:** The Queen Mother recalls Daniel's wisdom and integrity (Dan 5:10-12).
*   **Daniel's Character:** Stands apart from the corrupt court. Faithful despite circumstances (Dan 5:13-17).
    *   Refuses rewards, maintains integrity.
    *   [Aside: Like Daniel, our integrity in small things prepares us for moments when God calls us to stand for truth publicly.]

### Section 3: Weighed in the Balances [*] (12 min)
*   **Daniel's Rebuke:** Directly confronts Belshazzar's sin – pride, idolatry, failure to glorify God despite knowing better (Dan 5:22-23).
*   **The Interpretation (Dan 5:25-28):**
    *   [Write on board: MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN]
    *   **MENE:** God has numbered your kingdom and finished it.
    *   **TEKEL:** You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting.
        *   [Write: TEKEL = Weighed -> Found Wanting]
        *   [Analogy (from Dan 5:27): God's scales of justice – character weighed against His law/grace revealed in Christ.]
        *   Connection to Investigative Judgment: Examination of lives based on response to God's grace and truth (Rev 14:7; Eccl 12:14).
        *   RQ: What does it mean to be 'found wanting' in God's eyes? (RQ)
    *   **UPHARSIN (PERES):** Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.
*   **Finality of Judgment:** The line of mercy crossed. God's sovereignty demonstrated.
*   [Concept (based on Dan 5): God is patient, but His patience has limits, especially with willful rejection of light.]

### Conclusion: Lessons for the Last Days (8 min)
*   **Judgment Executed:** That very night, Belshazzar slain, kingdom falls (Dan 5:30-31).
    *   Suddenness underscores the message.
*   **Relevance Today:** Belshazzar's story is a type for the final judgment.
    *   [Write on board: Belshazzar's Night -> Final Judgment]
    *   The world is indulging, ignoring warnings, desecrating God's law.
*   **Call to Vigilance (Luke 21:34-36):**
    *   Warning against hearts weighed down by 'surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life'.
    *   Call to 'Watch ye therefore, and pray always'.
    *   [Write: Luke 21:36 -> Watch & Pray]
*   **Urgency:** Don't delay commitment. Today is the day of salvation (2 Cor 6:2).
    *   [Aside: Belshazzar's night teaches us that judgment can come suddenly. We don't choose the timing, only our readiness.]
*   **Invitation:**
    *   The Need: We are all weighed. Without Christ, we are found wanting.
    *   The Principle: God calls us to humble hearts, responsive to His truth (Micah 6:8).
    *   The Bridge: Belshazzar rejected known truth; we must embrace the Truth found in Jesus (John 14:6).
    *   Action Steps: 1. Honestly examine your heart – are you ignoring known truth? 2. Renew commitment to daily prayer and Bible study. 3. Choose today to glorify God in all you do.
    *   Final Appeal: Allow God, through His Spirit, to build His character in you. Don't be found wanting. Accept Christ fully now.
*   Closing Prayer
