### Introduction (6 min)

- **Hook:** Everyone wants success. What does it _really_ mean? Worldly vs.
  Biblical definitions.
  - **(RQ)** What comes to mind when you hear the word 'success'? Fame? Fortune?
    Comfort? Is that picture aligned with God's view?
- **Context:** Joshua's daunting task - replacing Moses, leading Israel into
  Canaan (Deut 31:7-8, 23). Facing giants and fortified cities (Num 13:28).
  - God gives Joshua a clear 'formula' not just for military victory, but for
    sustained, godly success in _all_ aspects of leadership and life.
- **Thesis:** God provides a clear, actionable blueprint for true success,
  centered on His empowering presence, diligent obedience to His Word, and
  constant meditation upon it.
  - `[Whiteboard: Write Title & Central Verse Ref: Joshua 1:8]`
  - `[Whiteboard: Success = God's Presence + Obedience + Meditation]`

### Section 1: Strength & Courage from God's Presence (Joshua 1:6, 9) (8 min)

- **Point:** True success requires divine strength and courage, rooted in the
  assurance of God's unwavering presence.
  - Read Joshua 1:6, 9. Notice the repetition: "Be strong and of good courage."
  - God commands courage _because_ He promises His presence: "...for the LORD
    your God is with you wherever you go" (v. 9b).
  - `[Whiteboard: COURAGE (v. 6, 9) <- GOD'S PRESENCE (v. 9)]`
- **Explanation:** This isn't self-generated confidence or mere human grit. It's
  a God-given fortitude that comes from knowing the Almighty is with us.
  - **(RQ)** Where do we typically look for strength when facing challenges? Our
    own abilities? Other people? How does Joshua 1:9 redirect our focus
    fundamentally?
- **Application:** We all face modern 'Canaans' – difficult tasks, spiritual
  battles, family responsibilities, witnessing opportunities.
  - The same promise given to Joshua applies to us through Christ (Matthew
    28:20: "...lo, I am with you always..."). We can access this strength
    through prayer and faith.

### Section 2: The Non-Negotiable Foundation - Obedience (Joshua 1:7) (9 min)

- **Need/Question:** Knowing God is with us is vital, but how do we ensure His
  blessing and guidance continues? What's our part?
- **Biblical Principle:** The foundation for receiving God's promised success is
  careful, complete obedience to His revealed will.
  - Read Joshua 1:7: "Only be strong and very courageous, that you may observe
    to do according to _all_ the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do
    not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may prosper
    wherever you go."
  - Emphasis on "ALL the law" – no picking and choosing. (cf. James 2:10).
  - `[Whiteboard: FOUNDATION = OBEDIENCE (v. 7) -> "ALL the Law"]`
  - **(RQ)** Why is partial obedience essentially disobedience in God's eyes?
    (v. 7 - "do not turn... right or left")
- **Bridging:** We live in a culture that often encourages compromise or sees
  God's commands as mere suggestions. But God links prosperity directly to
  careful adherence.
  - `[Aside: The "Book of the Law" here refers primarily to the Torah (Genesis-Deuteronomy), containing God's covenants, statutes, and judgments. It was their constitution and guide for all of life.]`
- **Actionable Steps (derived from v. 7):**
  1.  **Identify:** Prayerfully ask God to reveal any area where you are
      knowingly or unknowingly compromising His commands (turning right or
      left).
  2.  **Commit:** Choose one specific area identified and commit to aligning
      fully with God's Word this week, relying on His strength (Section 1).
  3.  **Study:** Spend time specifically studying the commands related to that
      area to understand them better.

### Section 3: The Method - Constant Meditation (Joshua 1:8a; Ps 1:2) [*] (7 min)

- **Need/Question:** How do we cultivate the mindset and understanding necessary
  for consistent obedience? How does the Law move from a book to our hearts?
- **Biblical Principle:** True success requires immersing our minds in God's
  Word through constant, purposeful meditation.
  - Read Joshua 1:8a: "This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth,
    but you shall meditate in it day and night..."
  - Read Psalm 1:1-2: "Blessed is the man... [whose] delight is in the law of
    the LORD, And in His law he meditates day and night."
  - `[Whiteboard: METHOD = MEDITATION (Josh 1:8a, Ps 1:2) -> Day & Night]`
  - **(RQ)** What does it practically mean to "meditate" on Scripture day and
    night in our busy lives? Is it just reading? (Hint: Hebrew 'hagah' implies
    murmuring, pondering, reflecting deeply).
- **Illustration:** Think of a cow chewing its cud. It doesn't just swallow the
  grass; it brings it back up, chews it slowly, extracting all the nutrients.
  Meditating on God's Word is similar – we ponder it, turn it over in our minds,
  extracting spiritual nourishment throughout the day.
- **Bridging:** Our minds are constantly filled with noise – media, worries,
  plans. God calls us to intentionally displace that noise with His Word.
  - **(RQ)** What occupies your thoughts most often? How can we make God's Word
    the 'default setting' of our minds?
- **Actionable Steps (derived from v. 8a, Ps 1:2):**
  1.  **Schedule:** Set aside a specific, non-negotiable time each day (even
      10-15 mins) for focused Bible reading _and_ reflection.
  2.  **Memorize:** Choose one key verse (like Joshua 1:8) to memorize this week
      and consciously recall and ponder it throughout the day.
  3.  **Speak:** Practice "not departing from your mouth" – talk about what
      you're learning with family or friends; let it shape your conversations.

### Section 4: The Result - True Prosperity & Success (Joshua 1:8b; Deut 28:1-2) (8 min)

- **Need/Question:** What is the guaranteed outcome if we follow God's formula
  of presence-fueled courage, obedience, and meditation?
- **Biblical Principle:** God promises genuine, lasting prosperity and success
  (defined by His standards) as the direct result of faithfulness to His Word.
  - Read Joshua 1:8b: "...For then you will make your way prosperous, and then
    you will have good success."
  - This isn't necessarily worldly wealth, but effectiveness, divine favor,
    spiritual well-being, and accomplishing God's purpose for us.
  - Read Deuteronomy 28:1-2: "Now it shall come to pass, if you diligently obey
    the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all His commandments...
    that the LORD your God will set you high above all nations... And all these
    blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey..."
  - `[Whiteboard: FORMULA FULFILLED -> PROSPERITY & GOOD SUCCESS (Josh 1:8b, Deut 28:1-2)]`
  - **(RQ)** How might God's definition of "prosperity" and "success" differ
    from the world's? (Consider Luke 12:15).
- **Illustration:** Building a life according to God's Word (obedience,
  meditation) is like building a house on the rock (Matthew 7:24-25). Worldly
  success formulas without God are like building on sand – destined to fail
  under pressure. God's way leads to enduring results.
- **Bridging:** We are often tempted to seek shortcuts or worldly methods for
  success. God's Word assures us that true, lasting success comes only through
  His prescribed path.
  - `[Aside: Notice the cause-and-effect structure: IF you meditate and observe to do, THEN you will prosper. It's conditional, but the promise is sure.]`
- **Actionable Steps (derived from v. 8b, Deut 28:1-2):**
  1.  **Redefine:** Ask God to help you redefine success according to His values
      (faithfulness, character, service) rather than worldly metrics.
  2.  **Trust:** Make a conscious decision to trust God's promise of success
      through obedience, even when it seems counter-intuitive or difficult.
  3.  **Testify:** Look for ways God _is_ bringing true success/prosperity
      (spiritual growth, answered prayer, opportunities to serve) and give Him
      thanks.

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

- **Summary:** God gave Joshua, and gives us, a clear formula for true success:
  1.  Draw **Strength & Courage** from His promised **Presence** (v. 6, 9).
  2.  Build on the non-negotiable foundation of careful **Obedience** to _all_
      His Word (v. 7).
  3.  Employ the method of constant **Meditation** on His Law (v. 8a).
  4.  Trust His promise for the result: genuine **Prosperity & Good Success**
      (v. 8b).
  - `[Whiteboard: Review the key terms: PRESENCE -> COURAGE -> OBEDIENCE -> MEDITATION -> SUCCESS]`
- **Application Recap:** We've identified practical steps: seeking God's
  strength, committing to full obedience in specific areas, scheduling
  meditation, memorizing scripture, and redefining success.
- **Illustration Connection:** Like building on the rock, this formula provides
  stability and enduring results in a shaky world.
- **Invitation/Appeal:** God desires success for you – His kind of success. It's
  not complicated, but it requires commitment. Will you accept His formula? Will
  you commit today to:
  - Trusting His presence for courage?
  - Obeying His Word fully?
  - Meditating on it day and night?
  - **(RQ)** Are you willing to exchange the world's fleeting definition of
    success for God's guaranteed, eternal one?
- **Call to Action:** Choose one actionable step discussed today and purpose in
  your heart to implement it this week, starting now. Let's pray for the
  strength to follow God's formula.
- **Closing Thought:** Remember the closing hymn: True blessing comes when we
  "Trust and Obey."
