### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Common views of the Holy Spirit - vague influence, impersonal force,
  lesser being. **(RQ)** Does our understanding match Scripture?
- Problem: Incorrect views hinder relationship and reception of power.
- Goal: Explore the biblical truth about the Holy Spirit – His divinity,
  personality, and vital work.
- Introduce Central Verse: John 14:16-17 - Jesus promises a personal, abiding
  Comforter, the Spirit of Truth.

    `[Whiteboard: Matt 28:19 -> Father | Son | Holy Spirit (Equal Persons)]`

  - Unity in distinction – a divine mystery, yet clearly taught.

  - **Obey Promptings:** Respond to His convictions and guidance toward
    righteousness.
  - **Avoid Grieving:** Shun known sin and attitudes contrary to His nature (Eph
    4:30-32).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

  Companion, Helper, and Guide – fully God.
