### Introduction (5 min)

*   Paint the scene: Calvary, darkness, the weight of sin.
*   Introduce the paradox: The Source of Living Water is thirsty.
*   Central Text: John 19:28 - A moment of profound human suffering and divine purpose.
    *   [Write on board: John 19:28 - "I THIRST"] 
*   Why this cry? What does it mean for us?
*   Goal: Understand how Christ's physical thirst secures our spiritual satisfaction.

### Section 1: The Reality of Christ's Thirst (12 min)

*   **Fully Human Suffering:**
    *   Jesus, fully God, was also fully man. His thirst was intensely real (Hebrews 2:14, 17-18).
    *   Physical causes: Blood loss, exposure, exhaustion.
    *   Emotional/Spiritual causes: Bearing the weight of sin, separation from the Father (Matthew 27:46).
    *   [Whiteboard: Physical Causes + Spiritual Weight = Intense Suffering]
*   **Conscious Fulfillment of Prophecy & Mission:**
    *   John 19:28 - "that the scripture might be fulfilled" (Ref. Psalm 22:15, Psalm 69:21).
    *   Refusal of pain relief (Matthew 27:34 - gall; Mark 15:23 - myrrh): He chose full consciousness.
        *   Why refuse? **(RQ)** To face sin's penalty with a clear mind, fully reliant on God through the Spirit.
        *   [Write on board: Conscious Choice - No shortcuts]
    *   He endured the cross *for the joy set before Him* (Hebrews 12:2) - our salvation.
*   **Calvary: Place of Agony and Victory:**
    *   Though terrible, the cross wasn't defeat. It was the battlefield where sin was conquered.
    *   His suffering demonstrates the depth of God's love and the cost of sin (Romans 5:8).

### Section 2: The Purpose Behind the Thirst (13 min)

*   **Contrast: Physical Thirst vs. Spiritual Provision:**
    *   The One who thirsted is the only One who can quench *our* deepest thirst.
    *   John 4:13-14: Jesus offers the Samaritan woman "living water" - eternal life, satisfaction in Him.
        *   [Whiteboard: His Thirst (John 19:28) <-> Our Drink (John 4:14)]
    *   John 7:37-38: His public invitation - "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink."
        *   What is this spiritual thirst? **(RQ)** A longing for God, meaning, forgiveness, peace (Psalm 42:1-2).
*   **Atonement: Bearing Our Penalty:**
    *   His thirst was part of bearing our sins (Isaiah 53:4-5).
        *   [Write on board: Isaiah 53:4-5 - He bore OUR griefs/sorrows]
    *   He experienced the separation from God that sin causes, so we wouldn't have to eternally.
    *   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies, our lives should represent the kingdom purchased by His suffering, not the customs of the world that caused it.]
*   **Source of Our Salvation and Strength:**
    *   Through His suffering, salvation is made possible.
    *   Our daily strength, forgiveness, and hope flow directly from His sacrifice.
    *   [Draw arrow: Cross (His Suffering) -> Grace -> Our Strength/Salvation]

### Section 3: Our Response to His Sacrifice [*] (10 min)

*   **Recognizing Our Need (Spiritual Thirst):**
    *   Do we recognize our own spiritual dryness and need for Him? **(RQ)** (Psalm 63:1)
    *   The world offers temporary relief, but only Christ satisfies eternally.
*   **Surrender and Receiving:**
    *   Revelation 22:17: "And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely."
    *   Coming requires surrender – acknowledging our need and accepting His free gift.
    *   [Whiteboard: Our Thirst + Surrender -> Receive Living Water (Rev 22:17)]
*   **Transformation Through His Sacrifice:**
    *   [Illustration Concept: Mended Vase] God doesn't just patch us up; He takes our broken, sinful lives (like shattered pottery) and through Christ's sacrifice, makes us whole and beautiful vessels for His glory (2 Corinthians 5:17).
*   **Finding God in Dry Times:**
    *   Sometimes spiritual dryness persists even after coming to Christ.
    *   [Illustration Concept: Ancient Boat Discovery] Like archaeologists finding a valuable ancient boat buried under dry sand, sometimes God uses the 'dry' periods of life, when worldly comforts fail, to reveal His deeper presence and purpose if we keep seeking Him.
    *   [Aside: Instead of despairing in dryness, we can ask, 'Lord, what treasure are You revealing here?' It's like finding a coin—even in a difficult place, it has value and can be used for the Kingdom.]
*   **Actionable Step:** Based on John 7:37, consciously come to Jesus *daily* with your thirsts (needs, sins, longings). Drink deeply from His Word and Spirit.
