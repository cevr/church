### Introduction (5 min)

- Set the scene: Golgotha, three crosses.
- Introduce the second saying of Christ from the cross.
- Context: Spoken to a dying thief – a moment of profound contrast.
- Theme: The power of Christ's presence and the promise of redemption, even at
  the last hour.
- **(RQ)** What does this scene teach us about the reach of God's grace?

### Section 1: Numbered with Transgressors (10 min)

- **The Need:** Understanding Christ's identification with sinners.
- **Biblical Principle:** Jesus positioned between two thieves (Luke 23:32-33).
  - Fulfillment of prophecy: Isaiah 53:12 - "He was numbered with the
    transgressors."
  - `[Whiteboard: Isaiah 53:12 -> Luke 23:33 = Prophecy Fulfilled]`
  - Demonstrates His mission: To seek and save the lost (Luke 19:10).
  - He didn't just die _for_ sinners, He died _among_ sinners.
- **Bridging to Practice:** Christ meets us where we are, in our brokenness.
  - **(RQ)** How does knowing Christ was physically placed among criminals
    impact our view of His sacrifice?
- **Actionable Step:** Reflect on Isaiah 53:12 this week, thanking God for
  Christ's willingness to be identified with us.

### Section 2: Repentance Beside the Savior [*] (10 min)

- **The Need:** Can someone truly repent at the very end?
- **Biblical Principle:** The contrast between the two thieves (Luke 23:39).
  - One mocks, reflecting hardness of heart.
  - The other rebukes, defends Jesus, and confesses faith (Luke 23:40-42).
  - `[Whiteboard: Thief 1: Mocking (v.39) | Thief 2: Fear God, Confess Sin, Acknowledge Jesus' Kingship (v.40-42)]`
  - What prompted the change? The presence, words, and spirit of Christ (cf.
    John 12:32 - "I...will draw all men unto me").
  - Genuine repentance involves: Acknowledging sin, recognizing God's justice,
    turning to Christ in faith.
- **Bridging to Practice:** Christ's presence, even in suffering, has
  transformative power.
  - `[Analogy (from Luke 23:42): Faith like reaching out a hand, even in weakness, trusting He will grasp it.]`
  - **(RQ)** What elements of the thief's confession (Luke 23:41-42) show
    genuine faith?
- **Actionable Step:** Pray for opportunities to reflect Christ's character,
  knowing His presence can draw others even without many words.

### Section 3: The King's Promise Explained (12 min)

- **The Need:** Understanding the timing and nature of the promise.
- **Biblical Principle:** Jesus' response: "Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
  thou be with me in paradise." (Luke 23:43)
  - Jesus identified as King, capable of granting entrance to His kingdom (Luke
    23:42).
  - The Promise: Future fellowship in Paradise.
  - **Crucial Interpretation:** The comma placement and Greek structure indicate
    'Today' modifies 'I say,' not 'shalt thou be.'
    - `[Whiteboard: Luke 23:43 - "Verily I say unto thee TO DAY, shalt thou be with me in paradise."]`
    - Meaning: "I am giving you this promise _today_." Assurance is immediate.
  - Upholding State of the Dead: Jesus Himself did not go to Paradise that day
    (John 20:17 - "I am not yet ascended to my Father"). The dead sleep until
    the resurrection (Eccl 9:5; John 5:28-29).
  - Paradise = The Father's house, prepared for believers (John 14:1-3).
  - `[Aside: Like a king signing a decree today for a future event, Jesus gave the thief binding assurance *that day* of his future place in Paradise.]`
- **Bridging to Practice:** Assurance of salvation is based on Christ's word
  _now_, fulfillment is future.
  - **(RQ)** Why is understanding the timing ('today') important for our
    understanding of death and resurrection?
- **Actionable Step:** Study John 14:1-3 and 1 Thess 4:16-17 this week to
  solidify understanding of the future hope.

### Section 4: Assurance & Open Invitation (3 min)

- **The Need:** Can _I_ be sure of salvation?
- **Biblical Principle:** The thief's experience demonstrates core gospel
  truths.
  - Instant assurance upon repentance and faith (Luke 23:43 - the promise was
    immediate).
  - Sufficiency of Christ's blood: Cleanses _all_ sin (1 John 1:7).
    - `[Whiteboard: 1 John 1:7 = ALL sin cleansed]`
  - Gospel invitation is open to _all_ who come (John 6:37).
- **Bridging to Practice:** No one is beyond the reach of grace if they turn to
  Christ.
  - `[Metaphor (from John 6:37): Christ's arms open on the cross, symbolizing His open invitation.]`
- **Actionable Step:** Share John 6:37 with someone who feels unworthy of God's
  love.

### Conclusion (5 min)

- Recap: The second word is a powerful promise of redemption, given by the King
  even in His deepest suffering.
- The Cross as Judgment Preview: Humanity divided by their response to Christ
  (cf. Matt 25:32-33).
  - `[Aside: The two thieves represent the two choices all humanity faces when confronted with Christ crucified - rejection or acceptance.]`
- Assurance is available _today_ through faith in Christ's promise.
- The promise isn't just escape from death, but future fellowship with Christ in
  Paradise.
- **Invitation:** Have you, like the thief, recognized Jesus as Lord and King?
  Have you accepted His promise _today_?
  - **(RQ)** Will you trust His word today for your future hope?
