-   [Whiteboard: Title - Jonah: The God Who Pursues]

### Section 1: God's Sovereign Call & Universal Love (Jonah 1) (10 min)
-   **The Need/Question:** Why flee God's specific command? (Jonah 1:1-3)
    -   Jonah knew God's character (Jonah 4:2) - feared God would be merciful to enemies!
    -   **RQ:** Do we ever resist God's call because it conflicts with our comfort or prejudice?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** God's Sovereignty & Universal Love
    -   God's Authority: He commands, directs nations and nature (Jonah 1:1, 4, 17). [Whiteboard: God's Sovereignty (Jonah 1:1, 4, 17)]
    -   God's Scope: His concern extends beyond Israel to pagan Nineveh (Jonah 1:2). He sees their wickedness and desires their repentance.
    -   [Whiteboard: Universal Love (Jonah 1:2) -> Nineveh]
    -   God pursues His reluctant servant (Jonah 1:4-17).
-   **Bridging to Practice:** God's mission field is the *world*, not just familiar territory.
    -   [Analogy (from Jonah 1): God's call like a specific assignment - requires obedience even when difficult or counter-intuitive.]
    -   **RQ:** Who are the 'Ninevites' God might be calling us to reach today?
-   **Actionable Steps (from Jonah 1):**
    1.  Recognize God's sovereign call in your life (even small promptings).
    2.  Examine personal biases that might hinder obedience.
    3.  Pray for a heart aligned with God's universal love.

### Section 2: God's Loving Discipline & Gracious Restoration (Jonah 2-3) [*] (12 min)
-   **The Need/Question:** What happens when we run from God? Can we come back?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** Discipline, Mercy, Second Chances
    -   God Disciplines in Love: The storm, the fish – not just punishment, but correction (Jonah 1:17; cf. Hebrews 12:7, 11). [Whiteboard: Discipline (Heb 12:7, 11) -> Correction, not just Punishment]
    -   God Hears Prayer Anywhere: Even from the depths (Jonah 2:1-2).
    -   God Shows Mercy: Jonah acknowledges salvation belongs to God (Jonah 2:9); God commands deliverance (Jonah 2:10).
    -   God Offers Second Chances: The call repeated (Jonah 3:1-2). Failure isn't final with God. [Whiteboard: Second Chance! (Jonah 3:1-2)]
    -   God Eager to Save: Nineveh's repentance met with God's relenting (Jonah 3:5-10). [Whiteboard: Repentance (Nineveh - Jonah 3:10) -> God Relents]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** God's discipline is restorative; His grace is persistent.
    -   [Aside: God's discipline is like a loving parent correcting a child straying towards danger. It stems from care, aiming for safety and return, not condemnation.]
    -   **RQ:** How have we experienced God's corrective hand or His second chances after failure?
-   **Actionable Steps (from Jonah 2-3):**
    1.  When facing trials, ask if God might be correcting or redirecting (Heb 12:7).
    2.  Turn to God in prayer, even from difficult circumstances (Jonah 2:1-2).
    3.  Accept God's forgiveness and embrace second chances for service (Jonah 3:1-2).
    4.  Believe in the power of repentance – for ourselves and others (Jonah 3:10).

### Section 3: God's Compassion vs. Human Prejudice (Jonah 4) & Christ Typology (12 min)
-   **The Need/Question:** Why struggle with God's mercy towards *others*? (Jonah 4:1-4)
    -   Jonah's anger reveals prejudice and nationalistic exclusiveness.
-   **The Biblical Principle:** God's Overwhelming Compassion & Rejection of Prejudice
    -   Jonah Knew God's Character: Merciful, gracious, slow to anger, abundant in kindness (Jonah 4:2 - quoting Ex 34:6-7).
    -   God Values All Life: His concern for people *and* animals (Jonah 4:10-11). [Whiteboard: God's Compassion (Jonah 4:11) > Human Prejudice (Jonah 4:1-3)]
    -   God Challenges Our Perspective: The gourd lesson – Jonah cared more for a plant than souls (Jonah 4:6-11).
    -   **RQ:** Do our priorities reflect God's priorities? Do we value comfort over souls?
-   **Bridging to Practice:** True religion requires internal commitment, battling prejudice.
    -   [Hypothetical Concept (based on Jonah 4): Imagine feeling angry when someone you dislike receives forgiveness or blessing. That's Jonah's struggle.]
    -   We must reflect God's universal love, not cultural biases.
    -   [Aside: Our churches should be outposts of Heaven's universal love, welcoming all whom the Father draws, challenging the exclusive attitudes sometimes found even among believers.]
-   **Typology of Christ:** Jonah's experience foreshadowed Christ (Matthew 12:40).
    -   Three days/nights: Signifies death and resurrection. [Whiteboard: Sign of Jonah (Matt 12:40) -> Death & Resurrection]
    -   Preaching after deliverance led to repentance (Nineveh/Gentiles).
-   **Actionable Steps (from Jonah 4 & Matt 12:40):**
    1.  Pray for God's perspective on people different from us (Jonah 4:11).
    2.  Actively challenge personal or cultural prejudices with God's Word.
    3.  Remember the 'sign of Jonah' – Christ's death/resurrection is the ultimate proof of God's love for *all*.
    4.  Commit to internal spiritual values over external comfort (cf. Jonah 4:6-9).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
