### Introduction (5 min)
- What is Salvation? Deliverance, preservation, restoration.
- Importance: Eternal life, relationship with God.
- Overview: Salvation isn't just one event, but has past, present, and future dimensions.
    - `[Whiteboard: Write SALVATION]`
    - `[Whiteboard: Draw three columns: PAST | PRESENT | FUTURE]`
- Centrality of Christ: He is the source and means (Acts 4:12).
- Goal: Understand the fullness of God's plan through His Word.
- `[Aside: Think of salvation like a three-act play God wrote for us: Act 1 (Justification) sets the stage with forgiveness, Act 2 (Sanctification) is the main story of transformation, and Act 3 (Glorification) is the grand finale of eternal life. All acts are essential to the complete story! (cf. Eph 2:8)]`

### Past Salvation: Justification - Foundation Laid (12 min)
- **The Need:** All have sinned (Rom 3:23). Separation from God.
- **The Provision:** Christ's Substitutionary Atonement.
    - He bore *our* griefs, sorrows, transgressions (Isa 53:4-6).
        - `[Whiteboard: Under PAST, write: Atonement (Isa 53:4-6)]`
    - God demonstrated His love: Christ died *for us* while we were sinners (Rom 5:8).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Christ Died FOR US (Rom 5:8)]`
        - RQ: What does it mean that Christ died *for* you, personally? (RQ)
- **The Result:** Justification - Declared Righteous.
    - Received by Grace through Faith (Eph 2:8).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Justification = Declared Righteous]`
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Grace + Faith (Eph 2:8)]`
    - `[Analogy: Justification (Eph 2:8, Rom 5:8) is like a full legal pardon. The judge (God), based on someone else paying the penalty (Christ), declares the guilty person righteous in the eyes of the law. The past record is wiped clean, not because the person earned it, but because the debt was paid.]`
    - Not based on our merit, but His purpose and grace (2 Tim 1:9).
    - The just live by faith from start to finish (Rom 1:17).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Faith Alone (Rom 1:17)]`
- **Summary:** Our past guilt is covered completely by Christ's sacrifice, received through faith.

### Present Salvation: Sanctification - The Ongoing Journey (15 min)
- **The Reality:** We are *being* saved (present continuous tense).
    - The message of the cross is power to us who are *being saved* (1 Cor 1:18).
        - `[Whiteboard: Under PRESENT, write: Sanctification = Being Made Righteous]`
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Being Saved (1 Cor 1:18)]`
    - The Lord added daily those who were *being saved* (Acts 2:47).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Daily Process (Acts 2:47)]`
- **The Process:** Lifelong work of overcoming sin, subduing self.
    - Enabled by God's power, requires our cooperation.
    - EGW Quote Summary: 'Sanctification is not the work of a moment... but of a lifetime... so long as Satan reigns, we shall have self to subdue... no stopping place...' (Acts of the Apostles, 561-562).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Lifelong Journey (AA 561)]`
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: God's Power + Our Cooperation = Overcoming]`
    - RQ: If sanctification is lifelong, how should we view setbacks or ongoing struggles? (RQ)
- `[Aside: "Sanctification isn't about achieving perfection *by ourselves*, but about consistently *allowing* God's power to work *in us*. It's like learning a skill – progress comes through practice and reliance on the instructor, not instant mastery."]`
- **Practical Steps (derived from principle):**
    - Daily surrender to God's will (cf. Rom 12:1-2).
    - Relying on His strength in temptation (cf. 1 Cor 10:13).
    - Engaging in spiritual disciplines: Prayer, Bible Study (cf. Psa 119:11).
        - `[Whiteboard: Action Steps: Surrender Daily, Rely on Power, Engage Spiritually]`
- **Invitation:** Embrace the daily process of allowing God to transform your character.

### Future Salvation: Glorification & Urgency [*] (8 min)
- **The Hope:** Final deliverance and transformation.
    - We shall be saved from wrath through Him (Rom 5:9 - future tense).
        - `[Whiteboard: Under FUTURE, write: Glorification = Made Perfectly Righteous]`
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Saved from Wrath (Rom 5:9)]`
    - Waiting for the redemption of our body (Rom 8:23).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Redemption of Body (Rom 8:23)]`
    - Caught up to meet the Lord at His Coming (1 Thess 4:16-17).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Second Coming (1 Thess 4:17)]`
        - `[Draw simple timeline: Justification (Cross) -> Sanctification (Life) -> Glorification (2nd Coming)]`
- **The Urgency:** Understanding the times.
    - Our salvation is nearer than when we first believed (Rom 13:11).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Salvation is Near! (Rom 13:11)]`
    - `[Analogy: Like knowing a beloved family member is arriving soon (Rom 13:11). As the arrival time gets closer, preparations become more focused and urgent. Our spiritual 'readiness' should intensify as Christ's return nears.]`
    - Need for patience and perseverance to receive the promise (Heb 10:36-37).
        - `[Whiteboard: Add: Need Perseverance (Heb 10:36)]`
    - RQ: How does the nearness of Christ's return motivate our present living (sanctification)? (RQ)

### Conclusion (5 min)
- **Recap:** Salvation is a complete work: Past (Justified by faith in Christ's atonement), Present (Being Sanctified by His power), Future (Will be Glorified at His return).
    - `[Point to Whiteboard columns]`
- **Foundation:** All dimensions rest on Grace through Faith (Eph 2:8), not works.
- **Simplicity:** God has made a full provision for our sin problem.
