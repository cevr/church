### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: Life's big questions – purpose, security, future. Where do we find solid answers? **(RQ)**
-   Context: Paul's confidence despite imprisonment (2 Timothy setting).
-   Theme: True assurance isn't based on *what* we know, but *Whom* we know.
-   Introduce Central Verse: 2 Timothy 1:12. `[Write on board: 2 Tim 1:12 - Key Phrases: Know Whom / Persuaded He is Able / Keep What I Committed / Against That Day]`

### Main Content 1: The Foundation - Knowing Whom (12 min)

-   Focus: "...for I know whom I have believed..." (2 Tim 1:12a).
-   Defining "Know": Beyond intellectual assent. `[Whiteboard: KNOW (Gk: oida) = Experiential, Relational Knowledge]`
-   Scripture: John 17:3 - Eternal life *is* knowing God and Jesus Christ. Unpack the depth – intimate, ongoing relationship.
-   Contrast: Knowing *about* God vs. *knowing* God personally. How does this impact response to trials? **(RQ)** `[Whiteboard: About God (Information) vs. Knowing God (Relationship)]`
-   Illustration Concept: Difference between knowing a historical figure and knowing your closest friend/spouse – trust is built on relationship.
-   Connection: This personal, experiential knowledge of Christ is the bedrock of Paul's (and our) unwavering confidence, even amidst suffering.

### Main Content 2: The Keeper - His Power to Guard [*] (12 min)

-   Focus: "...and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him..." (2 Tim 1:12b).
-   What is Committed? Our souls, our salvation, our lives, the deposit of faith itself (cf. v. 14 "guard the good deposit"). `[Whiteboard: Committed (My Soul/Life/Faith) ---> Kept by Christ's Power]`
-   Scripture: Philippians 1:6 - "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." Connect God's faithfulness to complete His work with Christ's ability to keep.
-   Scripture: 1 Peter 1:5 - We are "kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
-   Scripture: Jude 24 - "Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling..."
-   Emphasis: Our security rests entirely on *His* divine ability, not our fluctuating strength or feelings. `[Write on board: His Ability > Our Frailty]`
-   [Aside: Like a secure vault, Christ guards what is truly valuable – our souls entrusted to Him. No trial or temptation can breach His keeping power when we remain surrendered.]

### Main Content 3: The Evidence & The Hope (10 min)

-   **A. Remembering God's Leading:**
    -   How does reflecting on past faithfulness strengthen present trust? **(RQ)**
    -   Scripture: Deuteronomy 8:2 - "And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee..." Connect to personal testimony and God's historical guidance of His people (SDA history). `[Prompt: Briefly mention a key historical example of God's leading]`
    -   Purpose: Recalling God's proven faithfulness fuels confidence for present and future challenges. `[Whiteboard: Past Faithfulness -> Present Trust]`

-   **B. Against That Day:**
    -   Focus: "...against that day." (2 Tim 1:12c). What day? The Day of Christ's return and final judgment/vindication. `[Whiteboard: That Day = Christ's Return / Judgment / Vindication]`
    -   Scripture: Titus 2:13 - "Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ."
    -   Significance: Our commitment and His keeping power are oriented towards a final, glorious consummation. This hope anchors our present faith.

-   **C. The Enduring Gospel:**
    -   Connection: Paul's confidence in *his* deposit (v.12) parallels the *Gospel* deposit Timothy must guard (v.14).
    -   Scripture: 1 Peter 1:25 - "But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you." (cf. Matt 24:35)
    -   [Aside: The Gospel isn't just a historical message; it's a living, unquenchable flame passed through generations. Like the Olympic torch, our duty is to carry it faithfully, knowing its light cannot be extinguished by darkness.]
    -   The truth Christ guards, and which we are called to guard, is eternal and unchanging.
