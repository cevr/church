### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- The Corinthian Context: A gifted church, yet struggling with division and immaturity (Ref 1 Cor 1, 3).
- Question: What did Paul emphasize above all else to this talented but troubled church? **(RQ)**
- Introduce 1 Corinthians 13 as the answer: God's definition of what truly matters.
- Central Proposition: Biblical love (agape) is not merely a feeling, but the essential foundation and highest expression of true spirituality, superior to all gifts and actions without it.
- [Whiteboard: Title - What Matters Most? (1 Cor 13)]

### Section 1: Love's Indispensable Value (1 Cor 13:1-3) (10 min)
- **Read 1 Corinthians 13:1-3.**
- **Point 1: Eloquence & Knowledge < Love (v. 1-2a)**
    - Speaking with angelic tongues without love = noise. `[Whiteboard: Tongues/Prophecy/Knowledge - Love = 0 (1 Cor 13:1-2)]`
    - Prophetic gifts, understanding mysteries, possessing all knowledge – insufficient without love.
    - How might impressive spiritual displays lack true value according to Paul here? **(RQ)**
- **Point 2: Faith & Sacrifice < Love (v. 2b-3)**
    - Faith to move mountains – incomplete without love.
    - Extreme self-sacrifice (giving all possessions, martyrdom) – profits *nothing* without love.
    - [Whiteboard: Faith/Sacrifice - Love = 0 (1 Cor 13:2-3)]
    - Why does Paul place love above even the most dramatic acts of faith and sacrifice? **(RQ)**
    - Connection: These verses challenge superficial religiosity. God looks at the *motive* – the heart filled with His love (1 Sam 16:7).
    - [Analogy (from vv. 1-3): Spiritual gifts/actions without love are like a beautiful car with no engine. Looks impressive, but goes nowhere spiritually.]

### Section 2: The Anatomy of Agape (1 Cor 13:4-7) (15 min) [*]
- **Read 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.**
- Transition: If love is so vital, what does it *look* like in action? Paul defines it not by feeling, but by behavior.
- [Whiteboard: AGAPE LOVE IS... (1 Cor 13:4-7)]
- **Point 1: Love's Positive Actions (v. 4a)**
    - *Patient (suffers long):* Endures slights, delays, imperfections in others. `[Write: Patient]`
    - *Kind:* Actively good, gentle, helpful. `[Write: Kind]`
    - How do patience and kindness reflect God's dealing with us? (Exodus 34:6) **(RQ)**
- **Point 2: Love's Humble & Selfless Nature (v. 4b-5a)**
    - *Does not envy:* Rejoices in others' blessings. `[Write: Not Envious]`
    - *Does not parade itself, is not puffed up:* Humble, avoids self-display. `[Write: Humble]`
    - *Does not behave rudely:* Courteous, considerate. `[Write: Courteous]`
    - *Does not seek its own:* Selfless, prioritizes others' well-being (Phil 2:3-4). `[Write: Selfless]`
    - [Aside: Our church communities thrive when members prioritize 'seeking not their own' (v.5). It counters the self-focus so prevalent today, creating a space that truly reflects heavenly values.]
- **Point 3: Love's Response to Wrong (v. 5b-6)**
    - *Is not provoked:* Not easily angered, maintains composure. `[Write: Not Easily Angered]`
    - *Thinks no evil (keeps no record of wrongs):* Forgiving, doesn't hold grudges (Eph 4:32). `[Write: Forgiving]`
    - *Does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth:* Hates sin, loves righteousness and truth. `[Write: Loves Truth]`
    - How does 'keeping no record of wrongs' contrast with common human tendencies? **(RQ)**
- **Point 4: Love's Perseverance (v. 7)**
    - *Bears all things:* Protects, covers faults (Prov 10:12). `[Write: Bears/Protects]`
    - *Believes all things:* Assumes the best, gives benefit of the doubt (within wisdom). `[Write: Believes/Trusts]`
    - *Hopes all things:* Maintains positive outlook for others. `[Write: Hopes]`
    - *Endures all things:* Persists through hardship without giving up. `[Write: Endures]`
    - [Whiteboard: Draw circle around all characteristics -> This is God's Character (1 John 4:8)]
- **Application Bridge:** These aren't suggestions; they are the evidence of Christ's love dwelling in us (Gal 5:22-23 - Fruit of the Spirit includes love, patience, kindness, etc.).

### Section 3: Love's Eternal Nature & Supremacy (1 Cor 13:8-13) (10 min)
- **Read 1 Corinthians 13:8-13.**
- **Point 1: Love Never Fails (v. 8a)**
    - While gifts (prophecy, tongues, knowledge) are temporary and will cease... `[Whiteboard: Gifts = Temporary (v. 8)]`
    - Love endures into eternity. It is the very atmosphere of heaven.
    - Why is love permanent when even valuable spiritual gifts are not? **(RQ)**
- **Point 2: Present Limitations vs. Future Perfection (v. 8b-12)**
    - Our current knowledge and understanding are partial, like seeing in a dim mirror (v. 9-12).
    - In eternity, we will see face-to-face, know fully.
    - What remains when the partial is done away? Love.
    - [Metaphor (from v. 12): Current understanding like seeing through frosted glass; future perfection like clear view. Love is the constant reality on both sides.]
- **Point 3: The Greatest Virtue (v. 13)**
    - Faith, Hope, Love: All essential and enduring Christian virtues.
    - [Whiteboard: Faith + Hope + Love = Abide (v. 13)]
    - Yet, Love is declared the *greatest*. Why? **(RQ)**
        - Faith becomes sight.
        - Hope is realized.
        - Love *is* the eternal state, the nature of God Himself (1 John 4:8, 16).
    - [Whiteboard: GREATEST = LOVE (Charity)]
    - [Aside: Reflecting God's love isn't just about being nice; it's about embodying the eternal reality of His kingdom. Our daily interactions become opportunities to manifest the very essence of what will last forever.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
- **Summary:** We've seen from 1 Cor 13 that:
    - Love is superior to all gifts and actions (vv. 1-3).
    - Love has specific, actionable characteristics reflecting God's nature (vv. 4-7).
    - Love is eternal and the supreme Christian virtue (vv. 8-13).
- **The Source:** This kind of love isn't natural; it's supernatural. It comes from abiding in Christ (John 15:4-5) and receiving God's love (1 John 4:19).
- **Practical Takeaway:**
    - **Need:** Do my actions and service flow from genuine love for God and others? **(RQ)**
    - **Principle:** God values love (His character reflected in us) above all else (1 Cor 13:13).
    - **Action Steps (derived from vv. 4-7):** This week, choose one characteristic of love from vv. 4-7. Pray for God to develop it in you. Practice it intentionally in one specific relationship or situation. `[Whiteboard: Action: Choose 1 (vv. 4-7) -> Pray -> Practice]`
- **Invitation:** Let's ask God to fill us with His *agape* love, making it the foundation of our lives, our character, and our witness. Seek not just the gifts, but the Giver and His nature.
- Final Prayer focusing on receiving and demonstrating God's love.
