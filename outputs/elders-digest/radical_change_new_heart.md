### Introduction (5 min)
- Hook: We all desire positive change, but often feel powerless. New Year's resolutions fail. Why?
- The Core Issue: Not just bad habits, but the heart's inclination.
- God's Radical Solution: Not self-improvement, but divine transformation.
- Introduce Central Verse: Ezekiel 36:26 - God's promise of a completely new heart and spirit.
- [Whiteboard: Title & Ezekiel 36:26]
- Study Aim: To understand this promise and how God accomplishes this radical change in us.

### Section 1: The Problem - Our Need for Radical Change (10 min)
- **Humanity's Starting Point:**
    - Born with sinful nature (Psalm 51:5).
    - [Whiteboard: Ps 51:5 - "shapen in iniquity"]
    - This isn't an excuse, but a diagnosis of our need.
- **Inherent Inability to Self-Correct:**
    - Can we change our fundamental nature? (Jeremiah 13:23).
    - [Whiteboard: Jer 13:23 - Can leopard change spots?]
    - Human effort alone is insufficient for spiritual transformation.
    - Ellen White: "We are helpless and dependent" (SC 18).
- **The "Stony Heart":**
    - Describes resistance, hardness, unresponsiveness to God (Ezek 11:19a; Ezek 36:26a).
    - [Whiteboard: Stony Heart = Resistance (Ezek 11:19)]
    - **(RQ):** Have you felt that internal resistance, even when you know what's right? That's the stony heart Ezekiel describes.
- **The Need is Absolute:** Without divine intervention, we remain unchanged.

### Section 2: The Promise - God's Divine Solution (12 min) [*]
- **God Takes the Initiative:**
    - The promise originates with God: "*I* will give you... *I* will put... *I* will take away..." (Ezek 36:26).
    - This is grace â€“ God acting for us when we cannot act for ourselves.
    - [Whiteboard: Ezek 36:26 - GOD'S ACTION: Give / Put / Take Away]
- **Nature of the Promised Change:**
    - Removal of the resistant "stony heart" (Ezek 36:26b).
    - Provision of a receptive "heart of flesh" (Ezek 36:26b).
    - [Whiteboard: Heart of Flesh = Receptive, Tender (Ezek 36:26)]
    - Indwelling of God's own Spirit (Ezek 36:27a).
    - [Whiteboard: God's Spirit WITHIN (Ezek 36:27)]
- **The Agent of Transformation:**
    - The Holy Spirit accomplishes this new birth (John 3:5-6).
    - [Whiteboard: John 3:5-6 - Born of the Spirit]
    - **(RQ):** What does it mean that this change is a *birth*? (John 3:5) It implies a completely new beginning, sourced outside ourselves.
- **God's Faithfulness:**
    - He is committed to fulfilling His promises (PK 464).
    - We can trust Him to do what He said He would do in Ezekiel 36.
- **[Analogy (from Ezek 36):** Like a divine heart transplant. God doesn't just repair the old, diseased heart; He removes it and implants a completely new, healthy one, animated by His Spirit.]

### Section 3: The Process - Receiving & Living the Change (12 min)
- **Our Response - Conditions for Receiving:** (Not earning, but positioning ourselves to receive God's gift)
    - **Acknowledge Need:** Recognize personal inability and sinfulness (SC 18).
    - **Repentance:** Genuine sorrow for sin and turning away from it (Psalm 51:1-4, 17).
    - **Confession:** Specifically acknowledging sins to God (1 John 1:9).
    - [Whiteboard: Conditions: Need (SC 18), Repentance (Ps 51), Confession (1 Jn 1:9)]
    - **Earnest Seeking:** Wholehearted prayer and desire for God (Jer 29:13; EGW, True Revival).
    - [Whiteboard: Seek God Earnestly (Jer 29:13)]
    - **Surrender of the Will:** Consciously choosing God's way; yielding control (Prov 23:26; COL 159 prayer: "Take my heart; for I cannot give it...").
    - [Whiteboard: Surrender the Will (Prov 23:26, COL 159)]
- **The Result - Living the Transformed Life:**
    - **Empowerment:** Christ living within through the Spirit (Gal 2:20; SC 18).
    - **Obedience Enabled:** The Spirit *causes* us to walk in God's ways (Ezek 36:27b).
    - [Whiteboard: Spirit -> Causes Obedience (Ezek 36:27)]
    - **(RQ):** According to Ezekiel 36:27, where does the power for obedience come from after receiving the new heart?
    - **[Aside:** This isn't about earning salvation through obedience, but about salvation *resulting* in obedience. It's like a healthy tree naturally bearing good fruit; the new heart naturally desires to please God because His Spirit directs it.]
    - **True Conversion Manifested:** Demonstrated by alignment with God's law (GAG 144).
    - **Goal:** Character Perfection - Reflecting Jesus (COL 159). This transformation is key to God's plan for His people, especially in the last days.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
- **Summary:** We are born unable to change our sinful hearts (Ps 51:5). God promises a radical solution: a new heart and His Spirit within (Ezek 36:26-27). We receive this gift through repentance, confession, seeking, and surrender.
- **The Simplicity:** God offers total renewal, not just superficial fixes. [Whiteboard: Transformation, not just Modification]
- **Urgency:** The call for revival and this deep heart change is for *now*. We need this transformation to stand for God.
- **(RQ):** Are you tired of struggling in your own strength? Are you ready to claim God's promise in Ezekiel 36:26 for yourself?
- **Invitation:**
    - Acknowledge your need before God.
    - Confess known sin (1 John 1:9).
    - Surrender your will. Pray the prayer of COL 159: "Take my heart... It is Thy property..."
    - Ask specifically for the new heart and the indwelling Spirit God has promised.
- **Final Encouragement:** Trust God's faithfulness. He *will* perform His word (PK 464). Step out in faith, believing He is working this change in you.
