### Introduction (5 min)

*   Hook: Feeling stuck? Facing a 'wall' or an 'impossible' situation?
*   Theme Intro: God's surprising command in crisis: "Go Forward!"
*   Context: Israel trapped - Pharaoh's army behind, Red Sea before (Exodus 14:9-10).
*   Central Verse Read: Exodus 14:15 - The divine imperative.
*   Roadmap: Explore how God leads through difficulty (Exodus), empowers weakness (2 Cor), and calls us forward today (Prov 3).

### Section 1: Trapped But Led - The Red Sea Principle (12 min)

*   **God's Intentional Leading:**
    *   Exodus 13:17-18: God led them *not* the easy way, but towards the Red Sea. Why? **(RQ)** To teach reliance, display power.
    *   Exodus 14:1-4: Specific instruction to camp in a vulnerable spot. `[Whiteboard: Simple Map - Egypt -> Israelites (Trapped by Sea) <- Pharaoh]`
*   **Human Reaction vs. Divine Command:**
    *   Exodus 14:10-12: Fear, panic, blaming leadership. Relatable? **(RQ)**
    *   Exodus 14:13-14: Moses' instruction - "Fear ye not, stand still... see the salvation of the LORD... The LORD shall fight for you." `[Whiteboard: Stand Still (Trust) + See Salvation (God Acts)]`
    *   Exodus 14:15: God's command - "Go forward." The paradox: Wait *on* God, Move *with* God.
*   **The Principle:** God permits/leads into 'impossible' situations to strip self-reliance and magnify His deliverance.
    *   Connects to EGW, PP 290: Faith grows through testing. Trust is essential.
*   **Application Question:** When facing our 'Red Seas', do we complain/fear, or 'stand still' in trust, ready to 'go forward' when He commands? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Power in Weakness, Lessons for Today [*] (10 min)

*   **God's Strength in Human Weakness:**
    *   Israel's perspective: Utterly powerless (Exodus 14:10-12).
    *   2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." `[Whiteboard: God's Strength <-> Human Weakness (2 Cor 12:9)]`
    *   How was God's strength perfected at the Red Sea? **(RQ)** The impossibility highlighted the miracle.
*   **History as Instruction:**
    *   These accounts are not just history; they are lessons. `[Reference EGW, T4 25: Past experiences instruct God's people today]`.
    *   `[Aside: Just as Israel had to leave the familiar comforts (and bondage) of Egypt, sometimes God calls us away from comfortable routines or familiar sins to lead us forward into His plan, even if the path seems daunting at first.]`
*   **The Takeaway:** Our limitations are the stage for God's power. Learn from biblical examples of His faithfulness in crisis.

### Section 3: The Call to Advance Today (12 min)

*   **Faith: The Key to Moving Forward:**
    *   Hebrews 11:29: "By faith they passed through the Red sea..." It wasn't by sight or logic.
    *   The command "Go Forward" echoes today. `[Reference EGW, T4 26: Call to advance in faith, trusting God to open the way]`.
*   **Where is God Calling Us Forward?**
    *   `[Whiteboard: Question: Where is God saying 'Go Forward' to YOU / to OUR CHURCH? ]`
    *   Corporate Mission: e.g., 'Mission to the Cities', local evangelism, church planting. Obstacles seem huge? **(RQ)** Apply Exodus 14:13-15.
    *   Personal Life: Overcoming sin, stepping into service, mending relationships, deepening study/prayer.
    *   `[Analogy: Faith is like stepping onto the water - seems impossible, but obedience unlocks God's power (Ref. Peter walking on water, Matt 14)]`
*   **The Foundation of Trust:**
    *   Proverbs 3:5-6: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths." `[Whiteboard: Trust (v.5) -> Acknowledge (v.6a) => God Directs (v.6b)]`
*   **Practical Steps (Derived from Prov 3:5-6 & Ex 14):**
    1.  **Identify:** Where do you feel God's nudge to 'Go Forward'?
    2.  **Acknowledge:** Pray specifically, surrendering your understanding/fear (v.6a).
    3.  **Trust & Act:** Take the next step in faith, however small, trusting God for the path (v.5, v.6b; Ex 14:15).
    *   `[Aside: Sometimes 'going forward' doesn't mean a huge geographical move or dramatic change. It might mean moving forward in forgiveness, in consistent Bible study, or in speaking a word of truth in love when it feels difficult. God honours faithfulness in the 'small' steps forward too.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

*   **Summary:** God leads His people (Ex 13-14), sometimes into difficulty, to teach trust and display His power (2 Cor 12:9). He calls us to move forward in faith (Ex 14:15), not leaning on our own understanding (Prov 3:5-6).
*   **The Big Picture:** The Red Sea wasn't the destination, but a crucial step *towards* the Promised Land. Our trials, met with faith, propel us towards God's ultimate purpose.
*   **Reiterate:** Faith and trust are non-negotiable for overcoming and fulfilling God's will (Ref. EGW, PP 290).
*   **Final Question:** What 'Red Sea' are you facing? Will you trust God's power demonstrated in weakness? Will you obey His command to "Go Forward" in faith, believing He *will* make a way? **(RQ)**
*   **Invitation:** Commit that area to God now. Choose to trust and take the next step He shows you.
*   **Closing Prayer:** For faith, courage, and obedience to 'Go Forward'.
