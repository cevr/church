### Introduction (5 min)

-   Start with the universal longing for peace. What comes to mind when you hear 'peace'? **(RQ)**
-   Contrast common ideas (absence of conflict, tranquility) with the biblical concept.
-   Introduce the prophecy: Isaiah 9:6 - A ruler whose very name is "Prince of Peace".
    -   [Write on board: Isaiah 9:6 - Prince of Peace]
-   Thesis: True, lasting peace is not a human achievement but a divine gift embodied in Jesus Christ, requiring our surrender to His rule.

### Section 1: The Need for the Prince of Peace (10 min)

-   **The Original Peace Lost:**
    -   Briefly touch on Genesis 1-2: Harmony with God, self, others, nature.
    -   Genesis 3: Sin enters, breaking peace. Fear, hiding, blame, separation.
    -   [Draw simple diagram: God <-> Man (Peace) -> Sin -> Separation/Conflict]
-   **The Consequence: Universal Unrest:**
    -   Romans 3:23 - All have sinned. Inner conflict, relational strife, societal chaos.
    -   Isaiah 57:20-21 - The wicked are like the troubled sea... no peace.
    -   How does sin manifest as a lack of peace in our lives and world? **(RQ)**
-   **Christ's Mission: Restoration:**
    -   Romans 5:1 - "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace *with* God through our Lord Jesus Christ."
        -   [Write on board: Romans 5:1 - Peace WITH God]
    -   His primary mission: To bridge the gap sin created, restoring relationship with God.
    -   This restored relationship is the *foundation* of all true peace.

### Section 2: The Peace Only Christ Gives [*] (12 min)

-   **A Different Kind of Peace:**
    -   John 14:27 - "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: *not as the world giveth*, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid."
        -   [Write on board: John 14:27 - HIS Peace vs. World's Peace]
    -   Contrast Christ's peace with worldly substitutes: wealth, power, pleasure, escapism. Why are these ultimately unsatisfying? **(RQ)**
    -   Worldly 'peace' is often circumstantial, fragile. Christ's peace is internal, resilient.
-   **The Source: Christ Himself:**
    -   Ephesians 2:14 - "For he is our peace..."
    -   Peace isn't just something Christ *gives*; it's who He *is*. He embodies perfect harmony with the Father.
    -   [Aside: We often seek peace by changing circumstances, but God offers peace by changing *us* through His presence and indwelling Spirit.]
-   **The Nature of His Peace:**
    -   Philippians 4:6-7 - "...the peace *of* God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep [guard] your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
        -   [Write on board: Philippians 4:6-7 - Peace OF God (Guards Heart/Mind)]
    -   It's a supernatural peace, beyond human logic, acting as a garrison for the soul.
    -   How does knowing this peace guards our hearts/minds change how we face anxiety (Phil 4:6)? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: Receiving and Living in His Peace (12 min)

-   **The Condition: Surrender and Enthronement:**
    -   Renouncing sin, opening the heart (Rev 3:20).
    -   Colossians 3:15 - "And let the peace of God *rule* [act as umpire] in your hearts..."
        -   [Write on board: Colossians 3:15 - Let Peace RULE]
    -   Requires crowning Christ as King and Lord of the life. Aligning our will with His.
    -   [Metaphor: Heart as a throne - who sits there? Is Christ the ruling Prince of Peace, or is self/sin usurping the throne?]
    -   What does it practically mean to 'let' His peace rule? **(RQ)**
-   **The Experience of His Peace:**
    -   **Fellowship:** Peace flows from connection with God (1 John 1:3, 7).
    -   **Divine Self-Control:** Galatians 5:22-23 - Peace is a fruit of the Spirit, alongside self-control. His power enables inner stability.
        -   [Write on board: Gal 5:22-23 - Peace = Fruit of Spirit]
    -   **Assurance of Forgiveness:** Peace comes from knowing sins are forgiven (1 John 1:9; Romans 8:1).
    -   **Poise Amid Calamity:** Trusting God even in trials (Psalm 46:1-3; Isaiah 26:3 - "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee...").
        -   [Analogy: Peace like an anchor holding firm in a storm (cf. Heb 6:19)].
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
    -   1.  **Daily Surrender:** Consciously yield your will to God each morning (cf. Rom 12:1-2; Col 3:15).
    -   2.  **Cultivate Fellowship:** Prioritize time in prayer and God's Word (cf. Phil 4:6; 1 John 1:3).
    -   3.  **Practice Trust:** When anxious, deliberately turn thoughts to God's promises and character (cf. Isa 26:3; Phil 4:8).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   Recap: Sin broke peace. Christ *is* our peace (Eph 2:14). He offers peace *with* God (Rom 5:1) and the peace *of* God (Phil 4:7), distinct from the world's offerings (John 14:27).
-   This peace isn't automatic; it requires receiving Christ and allowing His peace to *rule* (Col 3:15).
-   [Aside: True peace isn't the absence of trouble, but the presence of God *in* the trouble, guarding our hearts and minds as Philippians 4:7 promises.]
-   Invitation: Have you experienced the peace that only the Prince of Peace can give? Is He truly ruling in your heart?
-   Appeal: Choose today to surrender fully to Christ. Renounce anything hindering His peace. Invite the Prince of Peace to reign supremely in your life.
-   Final Prayer: For attendees to experience the deep, abiding peace found only in Jesus Christ.
