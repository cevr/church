### Introduction (5 min)

- **Goal:** Understand Jesus' _method_ of soul-winning through His encounter
  with the Samaritan woman (John 4).
- **The Need:** Many desire to share faith but feel inadequate or unsure how.
  Jesus provides the perfect model. (cf. Matt 9:36-38)
- **(RQ):** What made Jesus so effective in reaching hearts others avoided?
  (John 4:4 - He _must needs_ go through Samaria). His divine appointment and
  love.
- **Focus:** Not just the story, but the _principles_ Jesus demonstrated,
  grounded in Scripture.
- `[Write on board: Title - Jesus: The Great Soul-Winner (John 4)]`
- `[Write on board: Central Verse - John 4:14]`

### Section 1: Breaking Barriers (8 min)

- **Principle:** Genuine, Christ-like interest transcends prejudice and social
  norms to connect with individuals.
- **Textual Basis:** John 4:7-9
  - Jesus initiates conversation (v. 7). He didn't wait to be approached.
  - Crosses significant cultural/religious/gender divides (Samaritan, woman) (v.
    9). `[Write on board: Step 1: Initiate & Ignore Prejudice (John 4:7-9)]`
  - Meets a common, felt need (physical thirst) to open the door for a deeper,
    spiritual need (v. 7, 10).
- **(RQ):** What modern barriers (social, cultural, religious, personal biases)
  hinder us from initiating spiritual conversations like Jesus did? (v. 9)
- `[Aside: Jewish men typically did not speak to women in public, especially not Samaritan women, who were viewed by Jews as religiously and ethnically impure. Jesus' actions were radically counter-cultural.]`
- **Application (Need/Principle/Bridge/Action):**
  - **Need:** We often let fear or prejudice stop us from reaching out.
  - **Principle:** Jesus shows love ignores artificial barriers (v. 9).
  - **Bridge:** We encounter people from different backgrounds daily.
  - **Action Steps (from text):**
    1.  Pray for divine appointments like Jesus had (v. 4).
    2.  Intentionally initiate a kind word or conversation with someone outside
        your usual circle this week (v. 7).
    3.  Ask God to help you see people as He sees them, beyond labels (cf. 1 Sam
        16:7).

### Section 2: Revealing Need & Offering Living Water (10 min) [*]

- **Principle:** Gently guide people to recognize their spiritual emptiness
  before presenting Christ as the only true satisfaction.
- **Textual Basis:** John 4:10-19
  - Piques interest: Offers "living water" (v. 10). Creates curiosity.
  - Contrasts temporary satisfaction (well water) with eternal satisfaction (His
    water) (v. 13-14).
    `[Write on board: Jacob's Well (Temporary) vs. Living Water (Eternal) (v. 13-14)]`
  - Gently exposes her true need/sin through a simple command ("Go, call thy
    husband") (v. 16). Not accusatory, but revealing.
  - Acknowledges her partial truth ("Thou hast well said...") but points to the
    deeper reality (v. 17-18).
  - Her recognition: "Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet" (v. 19). The
    gentle confrontation led to recognition of His spiritual authority.
- **(RQ):** How did Jesus balance grace (offering living water) and truth
  (revealing her life situation)? (v. 10, 16-18)
- **Application (Need/Principle/Bridge/Action):**
  - **Need:** People often try to fill spiritual emptiness with temporary
    things.
  - **Principle:** Only Jesus offers lasting spiritual satisfaction (v. 14).
    Gently revealing need opens the door (v. 16-18).
  - **Bridge:** Everyone thirsts for meaning, peace, and hope.
  - **Action Steps (from text):**
    1.  Listen for opportunities to talk about true, lasting satisfaction found
        in Christ (v. 14).
    2.  Pray for wisdom to ask gentle questions that help people consider their
        deeper needs (like v. 16, adapted).
    3.  Always be ready to offer the hope of the "living water" (Jesus) when
        need is recognized (v. 10, 14).

### Section 3: Defining True Worship & Revealing Identity (10 min) [*]

- **Principle:** True worship is internal ("spirit") and based on God's revealed
  Word ("truth"), centered on recognizing Jesus as the Messiah.
- **Textual Basis:** John 4:20-26
  - The woman shifts to a theological debate (location of worship) (v. 20). A
    common diversion tactic.
  - Jesus redirects: True worship transcends physical location (v. 21-23a). It's
    about the _how_ and _who_, not the _where_.
  - Defines true worship: "in spirit and in truth" (v. 23b-24).
    `[Write on board: True Worship = Spirit (Heartfelt) + Truth (Biblical) (John 4:24)]`
  - (RQ): What does it mean to worship "in spirit"? (Sincerely, authentically,
    from the heart - cf. Matt 15:8). What about "in truth"? (According to God's
    revealed will, His Word - cf. John 17:17). (v. 24)
  - The Climax: Jesus explicitly reveals His identity as the Messiah she was
    waiting for (v. 25-26). "I that speak unto thee am he."
- `[Aside: The Samaritans had their own temple on Mt. Gerizim and accepted only the first five books of Moses (Pentateuch), leading to major theological differences with the Jews in Jerusalem. Jesus cuts through this historical debate to the heart of genuine worship.]`
- **Application (Need/Principle/Bridge/Action):**
  - **Need:** People can get caught up in external forms of religion while
    missing the heart.
  - **Principle:** God seeks sincere, biblically grounded worship focused on
    Jesus (v. 23-24, 26).
  - **Bridge:** We all engage in forms of worship (church, prayer, study); are
    they in spirit and truth?
  - **Action Steps (from text):**
    1.  Examine your own worship: Is it truly heartfelt and sincere ("spirit")?
        (v. 24)
    2.  Ensure your beliefs and worship practices are firmly grounded in
        Scripture ("truth") (v. 24).
    3.  Look for opportunities to gently point people beyond religious debates
        towards Jesus Himself (v. 26).

### Section 4: The Power of Testimony (7 min)

- **Principle:** A genuine encounter with Jesus naturally leads to immediate,
  compelling personal testimony that points others to Him.
- **Textual Basis:** John 4:28-30, 39-42
  - Immediate Action: The woman leaves her waterpot (symbolic of her old quest
    for satisfaction?) and goes to tell others (v. 28). Urgency!
  - Her Testimony: Simple, personal, and points to Jesus - "Come, see a man,
    which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?" (v. 29).
    `[Write on board: Testimony -> Invitation -> Jesus (v. 29)]`
  - Impact: Her testimony caused the Samaritans to come out to meet Jesus (v.
    30).
  - Result: Many believed _because_ of her word (v. 39). Testimony is powerful!
  - Deeper Faith: Others believed after hearing Jesus themselves (v. 41-42).
    Testimony opens the door for personal encounter.
- `[Illustration: Imagine finding an effective, free cure for a serious disease. You wouldn't analyze it for weeks; you'd immediately tell loved ones suffering from it! Our encounter with Jesus, the cure for sin (v. 14), should create a similar desire to share immediately. (cf. v. 28-29)]`
- **Application (Need/Principle/Bridge/Action):**
  - **Need:** We sometimes hesitate to share our faith, feeling unqualified.
  - **Principle:** A simple, personal testimony about Jesus is powerful and
    effective (v. 29, 39).
  - **Bridge:** Everyone has a story of how Jesus has worked in their life.
  - **Action Steps (from text):**
    1.  Share what Jesus has done for _you_ simply and honestly, don't wait for
        "perfect" knowledge (v. 29).
    2.  Focus your testimony on pointing people _to_ Jesus ("Come, see...") (v.
        29).
    3.  Pray this week for one specific opportunity to share a part of your
        experience with Christ (cf. Acts 1:8).

### Conclusion & Invitation (5 min)

- **Recap:** Jesus' method is reproducible: He broke barriers (Sec 1), revealed
  need & offered the solution (Sec 2), clarified true worship & revealed Himself
  (Sec 3), and empowered testimony (Sec 4).
- **Jesus' Perspective - The Harvest:** John 4:34-38
  - Soul-winning fulfills God's will and brings deep satisfaction (v. 34).
  - The fields (people) are "white already to harvest" (v. 35). There's an
    urgency; people are ready _now_.
    `[Write on board: Fields White = People Ready NOW (John 4:35)]`
  - We are co-laborers, building on the work of others (prophets, Jesus, fellow
    believers) (v. 36-38).
- **(RQ):** Seeing the readiness of the harvest (v. 35), how does this motivate
  us to overcome our hesitations and apply Jesus' methods?
- **Invitation:** Jesus met the woman where she was, loved her despite the
  barriers, gently revealed her need, offered Himself as the Living Water, and
  transformed her into a powerful witness. He desires to work the same way
  through us. Will you commit this week to prayerfully applying _one_ principle
  we studied today? Perhaps initiating a conversation (v. 7), asking a
  thoughtful question (v. 16), sharing how Jesus satisfies (v. 14), or offering
  your simple testimony (v. 29)? Let His love for the harvest compel you. (cf. 2
  Cor 5:14).
