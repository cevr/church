### Introduction (5 min)
-   Hook: Common anxieties about money, possessions, giving. Is it a burden or a blessing? Does God *really* care about our finances?
-   Introduce God's perspective: Everything belongs to Him (Ps 24:1 - *implied, mention briefly*). We are managers, not owners. This is called Stewardship.
-   `[Write on board: Stewardship = Managing God's Resources]`
-   Thesis: True biblical stewardship, defined by faithfulness (1 Cor 4:2), motivated by grace (2 Cor 8:9), and expressed through cheerful giving (2 Cor 9:7), leads to profound joy and aligns us with God's kingdom work.
-   Read Central Verse: **2 Corinthians 9:7**. What does "cheerful giver" imply about the *attitude* God desires? (RQ)

### Section 1: God's Ownership, Our Stewardship (8 min)
-   **Foundation:** We are stewards, managers of God's resources.
    -   Read **1 Corinthians 4:1-2**. Paul identifies himself and Apollos as "stewards of the mysteries of God" (v. 1). This principle applies to all believers regarding God's gifts (time, talent, treasure).
    -   What is the primary requirement of a steward according to v. 2? `[Write on board: Required: FAITHFULNESS]`
    -   Faithfulness implies managing something that belongs to another. How does recognizing God's ownership change how we view our possessions? (RQ)
-   **Accountability:** Stewards are accountable to the owner.
    -   Our management reflects our relationship with God (1 Cor 4:2 - "found faithful").
    -   This isn't about earning salvation, but about demonstrating our love and loyalty to the One who owns all.

### Section 2: The Practice of Godly Giving (10 min) [*]
-   **Systematic Giving: The Tithe**
    -   Read **Malachi 3:10**. God explicitly instructs His people to bring "all the tithes into the storehouse."
    -   `[Write on board: Tithe = 10% (Systematic)]` This is a baseline, a regular return of God's portion.
    -   God links obedience here directly to His blessing ("prove me now... if I will not open you the windows of heaven..." Mal 3:10). Is this a transaction, or a test of trust and partnership? (RQ)
-   **Sacrificial Giving: Offerings**
    -   Read **Mark 12:41-44**. Jesus observes giving in the temple.
    -   He contrasts the large sums of the rich with the widow's "two mites" (v. 42).
    -   Why did Jesus commend her giving *more*? (RQ) Because she gave "all that she had, even all her living" (v. 44). It was sacrificial, from the heart.
    -   `[Write on board: Offerings = Heart-led, Sacrificial]`
    -   **Illustration:** Imagine two people giving $100. For one earning $10,000/month, it's a small fraction. For one earning $500/month, it's a significant sacrifice. God sees the heart and the sacrifice, not just the amount (Mark 12:43-44).
-   **Attitude in Giving:**
    -   Revisit **2 Corinthians 9:7**. Giving should not be "grudgingly, or of necessity." God desires cheerful, willing hearts.

### Section 3: The Heart of Stewardship - Contentment vs. Covetousness (10 min)
-   **The Foundation of Contentment:**
    -   Read **Philippians 4:11-13**. Paul states he has *learned* contentment in *all* circumstances (v. 11-12).
    -   Where does this contentment come from? "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me" (v. 13). It's supernatural, rooted in Christ.
    -   `[Write on board: Contentment = Learned, Christ-Powered (Phil 4:11-13)]`
    -   Read **Hebrews 13:5**. We are explicitly told to be "content with such things as ye have."
    -   What is the reason given? "for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb 13:5). God's presence is greater security than any possession.
    -   `[Aside: Remember, Paul wrote Philippians while under house arrest in Rome! His contentment wasn't theoretical; it was tested and proven real through reliance on Christ's strength (Phil 4:13), not his circumstances.]`
-   **The Danger of Covetousness:**
    -   Hebrews 13:5 links contentment directly with freedom from the "love of money." Covetousness is the opposite of contentment.
    -   How does focusing on God's presence and promises (Heb 13:5) help us fight the desire for more? (RQ)

### Section 4: The Source & Result - Grace, Generosity, Joy, Provision (8 min)
-   **Motivation: Grace**
    -   Read **2 Corinthians 8:9**. "For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
    -   `[Write on board: Christ's Grace -> Our Generosity]` Our giving is a *response* to the incredible, undeserved gift of salvation and grace we received through Christ.
    -   How does reflecting on Christ's sacrifice motivate cheerful giving? (RQ)
-   **Result 1: Joy**
    -   Revisit **2 Corinthians 9:7**. "God loveth a cheerful giver." There is inherent joy in aligning our hearts with God's will and participating in His work through generosity.
-   **Result 2: God's Provision**
    -   Read **Philippians 4:19**. After commending the Philippians for their giving (v. 14-18), Paul assures them, "But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
    -   God promises to meet the *needs* (not necessarily all wants) of those who are faithful stewards and participate in His work.
    -   **Illustration:** Think of stewardship like being a channel for God's resources. As we faithfully allow His blessings (grace, finances) to flow *through* us via giving, He ensures the channel remains supplied (Phil 4:19) and the process brings joy (2 Cor 9:7).

### Conclusion and Appeal (4 min)
-   **Summary:** True stewardship isn't about rules, but relationship. It's recognizing God's ownership (1 Cor 4:1-2), practicing faithfulness (Mal 3:10, Mark 12:41-44), cultivating contentment through Christ (Phil 4:11-13, Heb 13:5), and responding to His grace (2 Cor 8:9).
-   **The Promise:** The result isn't burden, but joy (2 Cor 9:7) and trust in God's provision (Phil 4:19).
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
    1.  **Prayerful Review:** Ask God this week to help you see your resources (time, money, skills) as His (1 Cor 4:1-2).
    2.  **Systematic Faithfulness:** If not already doing so, prayerfully consider committing to returning God's tithe systematically (Mal 3:10).
    3.  **Cultivate Contentment:** When tempted by discontent, consciously recall God's promise: "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee" (Heb 13:5) and rely on Christ's strength (Phil 4:13).
-   **Invitation:** Will you choose today to step deeper into the path of faithful stewardship? Will you trust God enough to experience the joy He promises the "cheerful giver" (2 Cor 9:7)? Let's commit to managing His resources in a way that honors Him and reflects His grace.
