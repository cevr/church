### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce Topic: The undeniable, transformative power inherent in God's Word.
- Briefly state the core idea: God's Word isn't just information; it's living
  power designed to reach _everyone_ and produce real change.
- Central Verse Introduction: Hebrews 4:12 sets the stage – the Word is alive
  and active.
  - `[Whiteboard: Hebrews 4:12 - LIVING & POWERFUL]`
- Roadmap: We'll explore who the Word is for, its divine power, our role in
  sharing it, and the attitude required.

### Section 1: The Word's Reach & Our Attitude (8 min)

- **Point:** God's Word and His call are for _all_, especially those society
  marginalizes.
- **Scripture Focus:** Luke 5:31-32
  - Context: Jesus eating with publicans and sinners.
  - Analysis: Jesus explicitly states His mission: calling _sinners_ to
    repentance, not the self-righteous.
  - `[Whiteboard: Luke 5:32 - Called NOT the righteous, but SINNERS to repentance]`
  - **(RQ):** Reading Jesus' words and actions here, who did He prioritize? How
    does this challenge our assumptions or comfort zones?
  - **(RQ):** How might judgmental attitudes (like the Pharisees') hinder the
    Word's reach through us?
- **Application:** We must actively resist judgmentalism and see _everyone_ as
  someone Christ desires to reach.
  - `[Whiteboard: Our Attitude -> Open Door or Barrier? (Ref Luke 5)]`
  - Practical Step: Pray for God's perspective on people we might naturally
    avoid or judge.

### Section 2: The Word's Inherent Power (12 min) [*]

- **Point:** God's Word possesses divine, inherent power to convict and
  transform.
- **Scripture Focus 1:** Jonah 3:4-10
  - Context: Jonah's reluctant, minimal message to a pagan city.
  - Analysis: Despite the messenger's flaws, the simple Word of God provoked
    city-wide repentance.
  - `[Whiteboard: Jonah 3 -> Simple Word -> Massive Repentance = WORD'S Power]`
  - **(RQ):** What does Nineveh's response teach us about the power residing _in
    the message itself_?
  - `[Aside: Sometimes we judge the soil (people's hearts) instead of just faithfully planting the seed (the Word). Our job is sowing; the harvest belongs to God, as Nineveh shows.]`
- **Scripture Focus 2:** Hebrews 4:12 (Revisit Central Verse)
  - Analysis: Deeper dive - 'quick' (living), 'powerful' (active energy),
    'sharper than any twoedged sword' (penetrating), 'discerner' (reveals inner
    reality).
  - `[Whiteboard: Heb 4:12 -> Living | Powerful | Piercing | Discerning]`
  - **(RQ):** If the Word truly discerns thoughts and intents, how should this
    impact our personal Bible study? How should it affect how we view its
    potential in others' lives?
  - `[Analogy (from Heb 4:12): God's Word like a surgeon's scalpel - precise, revealing hidden disease (sin), enabling healing (repentance/restoration).]`
- **Scripture Focus 3:** Romans 1:16
  - Analysis: Paul is unashamed because the Gospel _is_ the power (dunamis) of
    God unto salvation.
  - `[Whiteboard: Rom 1:16 -> Gospel = POWER of God for SALVATION]`
  - Connection: This power works through the proclaimed Word.

### Section 3: Our Duty & Persistence in Sharing (10 min)

- **Point:** Believers have a solemn duty to proclaim this powerful Word,
  requiring persistence.
- **Scripture Focus 1:** 2 Timothy 4:2
  - Analysis: The command is clear: "Preach the word! Be ready in season and out
    of season."
  - `[Whiteboard: 2 Tim 4:2 -> PREACH THE WORD! (Always Ready)]`
  - **(RQ):** What does "in season and out of season" imply about consistency
    and overcoming inconvenience?
  - Connection to Evangelism & Three Angels' Messages: This duty includes
    proclaiming God's final warnings and invitation (Rev 14).
- **Scripture Focus 2:** 1 Corinthians 3:6-7
  - Analysis: Paul planted, Apollos watered, but _God_ gave the increase. Our
    role is faithful labor, not guaranteeing results.
  - `[Whiteboard: 1 Cor 3:6-7 -> Our Role: Plant/Water | God's Role: Growth]`
  - **(RQ):** How does understanding God's role in conversion free us from the
    pressure of needing immediate, visible results?
- **Need for Persistence:** (Ref Gal 6:9 - "not grow weary while doing good")
  - Trust the Word's inherent power even when results aren't immediate.
  - Character Building: Persistence develops faith and reliance on God, not
    self.
  - `[Hypothetical Concept (from 1 Cor 3): Imagine a farmer planting seeds. Does he despair if sprouts don't appear overnight? He trusts the process and keeps tending.]`

### Section 4: The True Source of Change & Our Posture (5 min)

- **Point:** True conversion is a miracle of the Holy Spirit through the Word,
  requiring humility in the messenger.
- **Scripture Focus:** John 16:8 (Spirit convicts), 1 Cor 3:7 (God gives
  increase)
- **Spirit of Prophecy Insight:** (Briefly reference)
  - Conversion is a miracle, not achieved by human effort (DA 407).
  - Character transformation is the Spirit's work through the Word (PK 169).
  - `[Whiteboard: Conversion = Holy Spirit + Word (Not Human Eloquence)]`
- **Our Required Posture:** Humility & Submission
  - Recognize we are merely channels for God's power.
  - Need for personal submission to the Word we share (Ref EGW TM 143 - need for
    consecration).
  - **(RQ):** How does recognizing the Spirit's role cultivate humility in our
    witnessing?
  - `[Aside: Our church buildings can represent our collective witness. Like spiritual embassies, they should reflect the principles of heaven (found in the Word), not just blend in with surrounding culture.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:**
  - God's Word is for everyone (Luke 5).
  - It possesses inherent, divine power (Jonah 3, Heb 4:12, Rom 1:16).
  - We have a duty to share it persistently (2 Tim 4:2, 1 Cor 3:6-7).
  - True change comes from the Holy Spirit through the Word, requiring our
    humility.
- **Reiterate Simplicity:** The core truth is simple - God's powerful Word
  works! Our role is to share it faithfully and without judgment, trusting Him
  for the results.
- **Practical Takeaway:**
  - This week, identify one person you might have overlooked and pray for an
    opportunity to share a simple truth from God's Word or an act of kindness
    reflecting His love.
  - Commit to spending time _in_ the Word, allowing its power to work in your
    own heart first.
- **Final Appeal:** Let's embrace our role as messengers of this life-changing
  Word. Let's trust its power, overcome judgmentalism, persist in sharing, and
  humbly allow the Holy Spirit to bring the increase. Will you commit to being a
  faithful conduit for God's powerful Word this week?
- Closing Prayer
