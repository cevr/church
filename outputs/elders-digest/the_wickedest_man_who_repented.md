### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Can anyone be too wicked for God to forgive? **(RQ)** Introduce the
  concept of extreme sin.
- Introduce King Manasseh: Son of righteous Hezekiah, yet described as
  exceedingly wicked.
- Purpose: To explore God's boundless grace, the nature of true repentance, and
  the reality of forgiveness through Manasseh's life and a prophetic vision.
- Central Verse Preview: 2 Chron 33:12-13 - Hope even in affliction.
- [Write on board: Manasseh - Wickedness -> Repentance -> Grace]

### Section 1: The Depths of Sin & Influence (10 min) [*]

- **Manasseh's Reign of Evil (2 Chron 33:1-9):**
  - Undid Hezekiah's reforms (v. 3a).
  - Idolatry: Rebuilt high places, altars for Baal, Asherah poles (v. 3b).
  - Astrology/Pagan Worship: Worshipped host of heaven (v. 3c).
  - Desecration: Altars in the Temple courts! (v. 4-5, 7a) [Write on board:
    Temple Desecration (2 Chron 33:4-5)]
  - Occult Practices: Child sacrifice, witchcraft, sorcery, necromancy (v. 6).
    [Emphasize severity - direct defiance]
  - Led Judah Astray: Made them do _worse_ than the nations God destroyed (v.
    9). **(RQ)** How powerful is leadership influence, for good or evil?
- **Consequences of Sin:**
  - Personal degradation.
  - National corruption and judgment invited.
  - Influence: Leading others into sin carries heavy responsibility (cf. Matt
    18:6).
  - [Whiteboard Question: What does 2 Chron 33:9 teach about the impact of our
    choices on others?]

### Section 2: The Call, The Crisis, The Turning (10 min)

- **God's Persistent Call (2 Chron 33:10):**
  - "The Lord spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they would not hearken."
  - God doesn't give up easily. He uses His Word, prophets, circumstances.
  - **(RQ)** How does God speak to us today when we stray?
- **The Crisis - God's Providence (2 Chron 33:11):**
  - Assyrian Captivity: God allowed consequences to bring Manasseh to his
    senses.
  - Bound, afflicted - a stark contrast to his previous power.
  - [Analogy (from text): Sometimes hitting rock bottom is necessary to look
    up.]
- **True Repentance (2 Chron 33:12-13a):**
  - In affliction, _he sought_ the Lord.
  - _Humbled himself greatly_ before God.
  - _Prayed_ earnestly.
  - [Write on board: Repentance = 1. Acknowledge (Affliction) 2. Humble Self 3.
    Seek God (Prayer) - based on 2 Chron 33:12]
  - **(RQ)** What distinguishes true humility from mere regret?

### Section 3: Forgiveness, Restoration & Lingering Scars (8 min)

- **God's Astonishing Grace (2 Chron 33:13):**
  - God heard his prayer ("was intreated of him").
  - Restored him to his kingdom.
  - Manasseh's Realization: "Then Manasseh knew that the Lord he was God."
  - Connect to Romans 5:20 - Where sin abounded, grace super-abounded.
  - [Aside: Like finding a priceless treasure buried under mountains of trash.
    God saw the potential for repentance even in Manasseh's depths,
    demonstrating His desire to restore, not just condemn.]
- **Evidence of Change (2 Chron 33:15-16):**
  - Removed foreign gods, idols from Temple.
  - Repaired the Lord's altar, sacrificed peace/thank offerings.
  - Commanded Judah to serve the Lord.
- **Lingering Consequences (2 Chron 33:17):**
  - "Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places..."
  - Influence: Damage done was not fully undone.
  - Scars remain: Innocent blood shed (2 Kings 21:16) couldn't be brought back.
  - **(RQ)** How does this temper our understanding of forgiveness? (Forgiveness
    is complete, but earthly consequences may persist).

### Section 4: Heaven's View - Justification Illustrated (10 min) [*]

- **Transition:** Manasseh was forgiven and restored. But _how_ does God view
  such a repentant sinner, especially given past wickedness? Zechariah 3 gives
  us a glimpse.
- **The Heavenly Courtroom (Zech 3:1-3):**
  - Joshua the High Priest (representing God's people/repentant sinners) stands
    before the Angel of the Lord (Christ).
  - Satan stands at his right hand to accuse him ("resist him").
  - Joshua is clothed in "filthy garments" (representing sin/unrighteousness).
  - [Draw simple diagram on board: Angel (Christ) <-> Joshua (Filthy Garments)
    <-> Satan (Accuser)]
- **The Accusation & The Defense (Zech 3:2):**
  - Satan points out the sin (like Manasseh's past).
  - The Lord (Christ) rebukes Satan: "The Lord rebuke thee... is not this a
    brand plucked out of the fire?"
  - Focus is on God's saving action, not the sinner's past merit.
- **Justification - The Divine Exchange (Zech 3:4-5):**
  - Command: "Take away the filthy garments from him."
  - Declaration: "Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee..."
  - Provision: "...and I will clothe thee with change of raiment." (Imputed
    Righteousness of Christ).
  - Added Blessing: Fair mitre (sign of authority/restoration).
  - [Write on board: Zech 3 = Sin (Filthy Garments) -> Christ's Rebuke ->
    Forgiveness -> Christ's Righteousness (Clean Raiment)]
  - **Connection to Investigative Judgment:** This scene illustrates the
    process. Satan accuses based on the record of sin, but for the truly
    repentant who have claimed Christ's sacrifice, Jesus presents His
    righteousness as their covering. Their sins, though recorded, are forgiven
    and covered by His blood.
  - [Aside: Our identity in heaven isn't defined by the 'filthy garments' of our
    past sins that Satan points to, but by the 'change of raiment' Christ
    provides. That's the reality the Investigative Judgment confirms for the
    faithful.]
- **The Fruit of Grace (Zech 3:6-7):**
  - The charge: "If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my
    charge..."
  - Obedience is the _result_ and _evidence_ of genuine repentance and
    acceptance of grace, not the _means_ of earning it.
  - **(RQ)** How does Manasseh's later life (2 Chron 33:15-16) reflect this
    principle from Zech 3:7?

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

- **Recap:**
  - Manasseh's story: No one is beyond the reach of God's grace (2 Chron
    33:12-13).
  - True repentance involves humility and turning to God.
  - Zechariah 3: God's provision for forgiveness is complete – He covers our sin
    with Christ's righteousness.
- **The Simplicity:** God's forgiveness is available to _all_ who genuinely
  repent, no matter how far they've fallen. It's about His grace, not our merit.
- **Challenge:**
  - Are there areas in our lives where we feel 'too far gone'? **(RQ)**
  - Have we truly humbled ourselves and sought God like Manasseh?
  - Are we living in the assurance of Christ's covering righteousness (Zech
    3:4-5)?
  - Is our life demonstrating the fruit of repentance - walking in His ways
    (Zech 3:7)?
- **Final Appeal:** Embrace God's incredible offer of grace. If Manasseh could
  be forgiven and restored, so can you. Turn to Him today, accept His
  forgiveness, and walk in the new life He offers through Christ.
- Prayer.
