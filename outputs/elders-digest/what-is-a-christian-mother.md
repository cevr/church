### Introduction (5 min)
-   What truly defines a *Christian* mother? Is it just attending church or holding certain beliefs?
-   Central Idea: Christian motherhood isn't a set of rules, but flows from a living relationship with Jesus Christ.
-   It's about reflecting His mind, heart, words, and actions in the home.
-   Introduce Central Verse: Philippians 2:5. What does it mean to have the 'mind of Christ' as a mother?
    -   [Write on board: Phil 2:5 - The Mind of Christ]

### Section 1: The Foundation - Relationship with Christ (8 min)
-   **The Need:** Motherhood is demanding; human effort alone falls short. Where does the strength and wisdom come from? **(RQ)**
-   **The Biblical Principle:** Everything starts with personal salvation and a new life in Christ.
    -   John 3:16 - The core of salvation: belief in Jesus brings eternal life. This is the non-negotiable starting point.
    -   [Whiteboard: John 3:16 -> Faith -> New Birth -> Foundation]
    -   This isn't just 'fire insurance'; it's the beginning of transformation.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** A Christian mother is first a Christian – someone saved by grace through faith.
    -   This relationship fuels everything else.
-   **Actionable Step:** Ensure personal daily connection with Christ through prayer and Bible study. Is He the foundation of *your* life? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Mind - Thinking Like Christ (10 min) [*]
-   **The Need:** Our thoughts shape our attitudes, reactions, and parenting. How do we cultivate godly thoughts amidst daily stress? **(RQ)**
-   **The Biblical Principle:** We are called to adopt Christ's way of thinking.
    -   Phil 2:5-8: Christ's mind = humility, selflessness, obedience. How does this contrast with worldly thinking? **(RQ)**
    -   Rom 12:1-2: Transformation comes through the *renewing of the mind*. Not conforming to the world's patterns.
        -   [Whiteboard: Rom 12:2 -> Renewed Mind -> Transformed Life]
    -   Isa 55:8-9: God's thoughts are higher. We access them through His Word and Spirit.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** How does a renewed mind (Rom 12:2) change how a mother views challenges, disciplines children, or manages her home?
    -   [Analogy (from Rom 12:2): Mind like a filter – choosing inputs that align with God's Word.]
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    1.  Consciously evaluate thoughts: Are they aligned with Phil 2:5-8?
    2.  Actively replace negative/worldly thoughts with scriptural truths (Isa 55:8-9).
    3.  Pray for the Holy Spirit to renew your mind daily (Rom 12:1-2).

### Section 3: The Heart & Words - Loving & Speaking Like Christ (10 min)
-   **The Need:** Family life requires immense love and patience. How do we love unconditionally? How should we speak?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** Christ's love (agape) and wisdom should govern our affections and communication.
    -   Rom 5:5: God's love (agape) is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit. It's supernatural, not just human affection.
        -   [Whiteboard: Rom 5:5 -> Holy Spirit -> Agape Love]
    -   Prov 31:26: The virtuous woman speaks with wisdom and kindness. Her words build up, not tear down.
    -   Eph 4:29: Let no corrupt communication proceed, but that which is good for edification.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** How does agape love (Rom 5:5) change discipline? How does speaking with wisdom (Prov 31:26) impact daily interactions?
    -   [Aside: *"Our homes should be like miniature embassies of heaven, where the language spoken reflects the King we serve – full of grace and truth, even when correcting error."*]
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    1.  Pray for the Holy Spirit to fill you with *agape* love (Rom 5:5).
    2.  Pause before speaking, especially when frustrated. Ask: Is this kind? Is it wise? (Prov 31:26, Eph 4:29).
    3.  Intentionally speak words of affirmation and encouragement daily.

### Section 4: The Hands - Helping & Serving in Christ's Strength (7 min)
-   **The Need:** Motherhood involves constant work and service. How can mothers avoid burnout and find strength?
-   **The Biblical Principle:** A Christian mother works diligently, drawing strength and finding purpose in God.
    -   Prov 31:10-31 (esp. v17, 27): Describes a woman of strength, diligence, and resourcefulness who fears the Lord.
        -   [Whiteboard: Prov 31 -> Strength (v17) + Diligence (v27) + Fear of Lord (v30)]
    -   Phil 4:13: "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." This is the source of her capability.
    -   Jesus understands: He sympathizes with our weaknesses (Heb 4:15). *Desire of Ages*, p. 512 highlights His understanding of mothers' burdens and the Spirit's power to mold children through a connected mother.
        -   [Whiteboard: DA 512 -> Christ's Sympathy + Spirit's Influence]
-   **Bridging to Practice:** The Proverbs 31 woman isn't about perfectionism, but about faithful stewardship empowered by God.
    -   [Metaphor (from Phil 4:13): Christ's strength like electricity – always available, we just need to plug in through faith and dependence.]
    -   [Aside: *"Like Hannah dedicating Samuel, a mother connected to Christ dedicates her children's potential to God, trusting His Spirit to work even when she cannot see the immediate results. This quiet partnership is powerful."*]
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    1.  Acknowledge dependence on God for daily strength (Phil 4:13).
    2.  Prioritize tasks based on honoring God and serving family (Prov 31).
    3.  Rest in Christ's understanding and sympathy when overwhelmed (Heb 4:15, DA 512).
