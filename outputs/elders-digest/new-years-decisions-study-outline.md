### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- The cultural tradition of New Year's resolutions - often fail. Why? **(RQ)**
- Introduce the biblical concept: Not just resolutions, but intentional growth
  toward God's calling.
- Read Central Verse: Philippians 3:13-14. This isn't about a calendar date, but
  a spiritual posture.
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & Phil 3:13-14]
- Overview: We'll unpack Paul's mindset for forward momentum in Christ.

### Section 1: Forgetting What Lies Behind (Phil 3:13a) (10 min)

- Focus on "forgetting those things which are behind".
- What things? **(RQ)**
  - Past Failures/Sins: Guilt, regret that paralyzes (cf. Psalm 51 - David's
    repentance leads forward).
  - Past Successes/Righteousness: Pride, self-reliance that hinders dependence
    on God (Phil 3:4-9 - Paul counted his 'gains' as loss).
- Why forget? They distract from the present task and future hope. (Heb 12:1 -
  "lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us")
- [Whiteboard: Write "FORGETTING" -> Failures (Guilt), Successes (Pride) - Cite
  Phil 3:13a, Heb 12:1]
- This isn't amnesia, but choosing not to let the past dictate present faith and
  action.
- It requires a conscious decision enabled by God's grace and forgiveness (1
  John 1:9).
- **(RQ)** What specific past things might God be asking _you_ to 'forget' in
  this sense, to move forward with Him? (Based on Phil 3:13a)

### Section 2: Reaching Forth & Straining (Phil 3:13b) [*] (10 min)

- Focus on "reaching forth unto those things which are before".
- Greek implies active, intense effort - "straining". Spiritual growth isn't
  passive.
- [Whiteboard: Write "REACHING/STRAINING" -> Active Effort (Phil 3:13b)]
- Requires focus and determination. Like an athlete (cf. 1 Cor 9:24-27).
- What are we reaching for? The prize! (Discussed next section).
- This involves implementing a plan for spiritual growth.
  - Prayer, Bible Study, Witnessing, Service.
- [Aside: *"Our spiritual life is often like a garden. Left unattended, weeds of
  doubt and sin naturally take over. Intentional 'straining'—cultivating virtue
  through God's Word and prayer—is necessary for a fruitful harvest that
  reflects the Gardener."*]
- **(RQ)** Based on Phil 3:13b, where does our spiritual progress require more
  intentional 'straining' rather than passive drifting?

### Section 3: The Goal & Godly Criteria (Phil 3:14, 1 Cor 10:31) (10 min)

- Focus on "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
  Christ Jesus." (Phil 3:14)
- The Ultimate Goal: The prize = Resurrection life, full conformity to Christ,
  eternal life with God.
- [Whiteboard: Write "THE GOAL" -> Prize = Christlikeness / Eternal Life (Phil
  3:14)]
- How do earthly goals align with this ultimate prize? Criteria for evaluation:
  - **1. Glorifies God?** (1 Cor 10:31) - Does it honor Him and His principles?
  - **2. Fosters Christ-likeness?** (2 Cor 3:18) - Will it help me reflect
    Jesus' character (love, patience, humility)?
  - **3. Contributes Positively to Others?** (Eph 2:10) - Does it build up the
    family, church, or community?
  - **4. Enhances Witness?** (Matt 5:16) - Will it make faith more credible and
    draw others to Christ?
- [Whiteboard: Write "GOAL CRITERIA" -> 1. Glorify God (1 Cor 10:31), 2.
  Christ-likeness (2 Cor 3:18), 3. Help Others (Eph 2:10), 4. Enhance Witness
  (Matt 5:16)]
- **(RQ)** How does evaluating our plans by _these_ criteria (from 1 Cor 10:31
  etc.) change our approach compared to worldly goal-setting?
- Character Building: Goals focused on these criteria inherently build godly
  character.

### Section 4: Practical Planning & Perseverance (Eph 2:10, Heb 12:1-2) [*] (10 min)

- Making it practical: Organize goals using the criteria.
- [Whiteboard: Write "PRACTICAL AREAS" -> Personal (Spiritual, Physical,
  Mental), Family, Church, Work, World (Community)]
- Example: _Personal Spiritual Goal:_ Deeper daily study (Criterion 1, 2).
  _Family Goal:_ More intentional family worship (Criterion 1, 2, 3). _Work
  Goal:_ Integrity in all dealings (Criterion 1, 4). _Church Goal:_ Serve in a
  needed ministry (Criterion 3, 4).
- Emphasis: Reliance on God's Help. Our effort + His power = Success (Phil
  4:13).
  - Resolutions fail without divine aid.
- [Illustrative Concept (based on Phil 3:14): Like a runner fixing their eyes on
  the finish line (Jesus - Heb 12:2), we 'press on' despite stumbles, knowing
  the prize awaits.]
- Perseverance is Key: "I press on..." (Phil 3:14). Expect setbacks. Don't give
  up!
  - Failure isn't final unless we quit. Get up, seek forgiveness (1 John 1:9),
    rely on God's strength (Isa 40:31), and continue pressing forward.
- [Aside: *"Setting goals without acknowledging our utter dependence on Christ
  is like a sailor setting a course without consulting the compass or the wind.
  We might exert much effort, but we'll likely end up far from the desired
  harbor of His will."*]
- **(RQ)** Seeing the call to 'press on' (Phil 3:14) and 'run with patience'
  (Heb 12:1), how should we respond biblically when we fail in our spiritual
  goals?

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: Paul's secret wasn't complex - Forget the past, Strain for the future,
  Press toward the ultimate Goal (Christ).
- Simplicity: Focus forward, empowered by God, guided by His glory and Word.
- Our resolutions/goals find true meaning when aligned with God's high calling
  in Christ Jesus (Phil 3:14).
- Invitation: Don't just make resolutions. Make a commitment to 'press on'
  toward Christ this year.
  - Choose one area, apply the criteria (1 Cor 10:31), rely on His strength
    (Phil 4:13), and start today.
- Final Encouragement: He who called you is faithful; He will surely do it (1
  Thess 5:24).
- Closing Prayer: Asking for forgiveness for past focus, strength to press
  forward, and wisdom to set goals that glorify Him.
