### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the concept: Beyond the Ten - an "Eleventh Commandment"?
- Not replacing, but fulfilling and defining the spirit of the law.
- Central Verse: John 13:34 - Christ's mandate.
  - [Write on board: John 13:34 - "A NEW Commandment... AS I have loved you..."]
- What makes this commandment "new"? **(RQ)**
- Focus: Understanding the _kind_ of love Jesus commands and how to live it.

### Section 1: Love - The Heart of the Law (10 min)

- **Love as the Foundation:**
  - The lawyer's question & Jesus' summary of the Law: Luke 10:27
    - [Whiteboard: Luke 10:27 - Love God (Vertical) + Love Neighbor (Horizontal)
      = Whole Law]
    - How does loving God relate to loving our neighbor? **(RQ)** (1 John
      4:20-21)
  - Love isn't just _part_ of the law; it's the underlying principle.
- **Expanding the Definition of "Neighbor":**
  - Traditional view vs. Christ's teaching: Matthew 5:43-44
    - "Love your enemies, bless them that curse you..." - A radical departure.
  - Why does Jesus command love for enemies? (Matt 5:45 - Reflects God's
    character) **(RQ)**
  - [Whiteboard: Neighbor = ANYONE in need/reach, even enemies (Matt 5:44)]
  - This love isn't based on the _worthiness_ of the recipient, but the
    _character_ of the giver (reflecting God).

### Section 2: Christ's Love - Our Pattern (12 min) [*]

- **The Standard is Christ, Not Human Feeling:** John 13:34b - "..._as I have
  loved you_..."
  - [Whiteboard: Standard = CHRIST'S Love (John 13:34)]
  - Human love is often conditional, selective, selfish. Christ's love is
    different.
- **Characteristics of Christ's Love (Illustrated by His Life):**
  - **Unconditional/Unrestricted:** He didn't wait for people to be 'good
    enough'. (Romans 5:8)
  - **Inclusive:** Sought out the marginalized - tax collectors, sinners,
    Samaritans. (Luke 19:1-10, John 4)
    - [Illustration Concept: Christ's table fellowship - breaking
      social/religious barriers.]
    - How does our church fellowship compare to Christ's inclusiveness? **(RQ)**
  - **Self-Sacrificing:** Focused on the highest good of others, even at
    ultimate cost.
    - John 15:13 - "Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
      life for his friends."
    - [Whiteboard: Sacrificial Love (John 15:13) -> Highest Good of Others]
  - **Selfless:** Not seeking personal gain, but the benefit and restoration of
    others. (Philippians 2:3-8)
    - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our interactions should represent the
      selfless love of the kingdom of heaven, not the self-serving customs of
      the world.]

### Section 3: Living the Eleventh Commandment (12 min)

- **The Supremacy of Love:**
  - Paul's emphasis: 1 Corinthians 13:1-3
    - Gifts, knowledge, sacrifice are _nothing_ without love.
    - [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 13:1-3 - Gifts/Knowledge/Sacrifice - LOVE = 0]
    - Why is love considered greater than even faith and hope? (1 Cor 13:13)
      **(RQ)**
  - Love is the animating principle that gives value to all else.
- **The Identifying Mark of Discipleship:**
  - John 13:35 - "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
    have love one to another."
    - Not doctrine alone, not church membership, but _love in action_ is the
      primary identifier.
    - [Whiteboard: John 13:35 - Love = The Disciple's ID Badge]
  - How effectively does our love identify us to the world today? **(RQ)**
- **Love as Evangelism:**
  - Christ's selfless, inclusive love attracted people.
  - Our practical demonstration of this love draws others to Him.
  - [Analogy: Love as the 'fragrance of Christ' (2 Cor 2:15) that draws people
    in.]
  - [Aside: Instead of just focusing on doctrinal arguments, demonstrating
    Christ's self-sacrificing love opens hearts. It's like finding a common
    language—love speaks universally, paving the way for truth.]
- **Practical Application - Emulating Christ's Love:**
  - **Need:** Overcoming selfishness, prejudice, conditional affection.
  - **Principle:** Choose to love _as Christ loved_ (John 13:34) - rely on His
    power.
  - **Action Steps (derived from texts):**
    1.  Pray for enemies/those who irritate (Matt 5:44).
    2.  Intentionally include someone often overlooked (Luke 14:12-14 implied
        principle).
    3.  Perform an act of service for someone with no expectation of return
        (Phil 2:3-4).
    - [Whiteboard: Action: Pray (Matt 5:44), Include (Luke 14), Serve (Phil 2)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Summary: The Eleventh Commandment (John 13:34) calls us to a higher standard –
  Christ's own love.
- This love is the heart of the law (Luke 10:27), supreme in importance (1 Cor
  13), and the mark of true discipleship (John 13:35).
- It's unconditional, inclusive, selfless, and sacrificial.
- This isn't natural; it requires divine power (Gal 5:22 - fruit of the Spirit).
- Invitation: Will we ask God today to fill us with _His_ kind of love, so the
  world may see Him in us?
- Final thought: Living this love is the most powerful witness we have.
- Closing Prayer
