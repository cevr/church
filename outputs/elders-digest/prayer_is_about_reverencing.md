### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: How do we typically begin prayer? Often with our needs, our requests.
-   The Divine Pattern: Jesus taught us to start differently (Matt 6:9). God first.
-   Focus: Unpacking the vital first petition: "Hallowed be thy name."
-   [Whiteboard: Matthew 6:9b - "Hallowed be thy name"]
-   (RQ) What does it truly mean to 'hallow' God's name in prayer and life?

### Main Content Section 1: Understanding God's Name (10 min)

-   **God's Name = His Character:** More than a label; it reveals *who He is*.
    -   Exodus 3:14 - "I AM THAT I AM." The self-existent, eternal One.
    -   [Whiteboard: NAME = CHARACTER (Ex 3:14)]
-   **Glimpses of His Character in OT Names:**
    -   Jehovah-Jireh: The Lord Will Provide (Gen 22:14)
    -   Jehovah-Nissi: The Lord Our Banner (Victory) (Ex 17:15)
    -   Jehovah-Shalom: The Lord Is Peace (Judg 6:24)
    -   Elohim: Mighty Creator (Gen 1:1)
    -   El-Shaddai: God Almighty (Sufficiency) (Gen 17:1)
    -   Adonai: Lord, Master (Ps 8:1)
    -   Father: Relational, Caring (Isa 63:16; Matt 6:9)
    -   [Whiteboard: List Names -> Key Attribute (e.g., Jireh -> Provider)]
-   **The Fullest Revelation: Jesus Christ**
    -   He embodies the fullness of God's character (John 1:14, 14:9).
    -   His name is above every name (Phil 2:9-11).
    -   (RQ) Knowing these facets of God's character, how should this shape our approach to Him in prayer?

### Main Content Section 2: The Act of Hallowing [*] (12 min)

-   **What Does "Hallowed" Mean?**
    -   To set apart as holy, to sanctify, to treat with reverence, to worship.
    -   [Whiteboard: HALLOWED = Set Apart / Holy / Revered / Worshipped]
-   **Prayer Begins with Worship:** Acknowledging WHO God is *before* asking for anything.
    -   It requires a conscious *decision* to center prayer on Him, not ourselves.
    -   Involves humble submission to His majesty and authority.
    -   (RQ) Is our prayer time primarily a 'to-do' list for God, or a time of genuine reverence and adoration?
-   **Historical Reverence:**
    -   Ancient Jewish scribes' practice: Extreme care with God's name (YHWH) - washing hands/pen before writing it.
    -   [Briefly describe scribal practice]
    -   Contrast with modern casualness.
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our lives, like embassies, should represent the King whose name we bear, showing reverence in a foreign land (the world).
-   **Avoiding Vain Use (Exodus 20:7):**
    -   More than just overt cursing.
    -   Includes trivializing God's name, using it lightly or carelessly.
    -   [Whiteboard: Ex 20:7 - Do NOT take the LORD's name in vain]
    -   Examples: Common minced oaths ("Gosh," "Jeez"), casual exclamations ("OMG").
    -   (RQ) How does our everyday language reflect our true reverence (or lack thereof) for God's holy name?

### Main Content Section 3: Living Out Reverence (12 min)

-   **Praying According to His Name (Character/Will):**
    -   We cannot ask for things that would dishonor His holy character.
    -   Our requests should align with His revealed will in Scripture (1 John 5:14-15).
    -   [Whiteboard: Prayer aligned with God's Character/Will (1 John 5:14)]
-   **A Petition for Divine Help:**
    -   Praying "Hallowed be thy name" is asking God to *enable us* to live in a way that honors Him.
    -   It's a prayer for personal sanctification – for His holiness to be reflected *in us*.
    -   (RQ) How does viewing "Hallowed be thy name" as a plea for help change our approach to daily temptations and choices?
-   **Our Lives Hallow His Name:**
    -   Reflecting Jesus to the world brings glory to the Father (Matt 5:16).
    -   Our actions, attitudes, and words should point others to God's goodness and holiness.
    -   [Whiteboard: Matt 5:16 -> Good Works -> Glorify Father]
    -   [Analogy (from Matt 5:16): Our lives like clean mirrors reflecting God's light/character accurately to the world.]
-   **The Ultimate Standard (1 Cor 10:31):**
    -   *Everything* we do should be oriented towards glorifying God.
    -   Eating, drinking, working, speaking – all become acts of worship when done with reverence for Him.
    -   [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 10:31 -> ALL to the Glory of God]
    -   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Even mundane activities, when done with reverence and for God's glory, become sacred acts, hallowing His name in practical, everyday ways.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** True prayer begins with reverence – acknowledging and worshipping God for His holy character revealed in His names, supremely in Jesus Christ.
-   **Hallowing His Name:** It's both an attitude in prayer (worship, submission) and a commitment in life (living reverently).
-   **Challenge:** How will we intentionally practice hallowing God's name this week?
    -   **In Prayer:** Start with adoration, focusing on *Who* He is.
    -   **In Speech:** Be mindful of casual or vain uses of His name.
    -   **In Actions:** Consciously seek to reflect Christ's character (Matt 5:16; 1 Cor 10:31).
-   **Final Thought:** Let our entire existence become a prayer: "Father, may *Your* name be hallowed, set apart, glorified, and revered in and through me today."
-   **Invitation:** A call to commit to a deeper reverence for God in our hearts, on our lips, and through our lives.
