### Introduction (5 min)
-   Welcome & Prayer
-   The modern challenge: Balancing work, life, and faith.
-   Is work just a necessity, or something more?
-   Introduce Central Verse: Colossians 3:23 - Our attitude towards *all* our duties.
    `[Write on board: Colossians 3:23 - "whatsoever ye do... heartily, as to the Lord"]`
-   Overview: Exploring God's perspective on work, diligence, and avoiding laziness, both temporally and spiritually.

### Section 1: God's Design vs. Slothfulness (12 min)
-   **God Ordained Work from the Beginning:**
    -   Genesis 2:15 - Adam placed in Eden "to dress it and to keep it."
        `[Whiteboard: Gen 2:15 - Work = God's original plan, pre-sin]`
    -   Work wasn't a curse, but a blessing, a means of development and cooperation with God.
    -   **(RQ)** How does viewing work as God's design change our perspective on our jobs or daily tasks? (Gen 2:15)
-   **The Bible's Strong Condemnation of Laziness:**
    -   Proverbs 6:6-11 - The Ant as an Example.
        `[Whiteboard: Prov 6:6-11 -> Ant = Diligence, Preparation; Sluggard = Poverty, Want]`
        -   Observe the ant: initiative, no overseer, prepares for the future.
        -   Consequences of sloth: poverty, sudden destruction (v. 11).
    -   Proverbs 21:25 - "The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour."
        -   Laziness isn't just inactivity; it's a destructive force.
    -   **(RQ)** Based on Proverbs, what are the tangible results of laziness God warns us about? (Prov 6:11, 21:25)
-   **Connecting Temporal Sloth to Spiritual Danger:**
    -   A character that indulges laziness in one area often allows it in others.

### Section 2: Diligence in All Spheres [*] (15 min)
-   **Temporal Work as Worship:**
    -   Ephesians 6:5-8 - Servants obey masters "as unto Christ... doing the will of God from the heart."
        `[Whiteboard: Eph 6:5-8 -> Work Ethic = Witness; Motivation = Serve Christ]`
    -   Our daily work, done diligently and honestly, reflects our relationship with God.
    -   Not just *what* we do, but *how* and *why* (Col 3:23).
    -   `[Analogy (from Eph 6): Our workplace is a mission field where our diligence preaches a sermon.]`
    -   **(RQ)** How can we practically 'do our work heartily, as unto the Lord' (Col 3:23) in our specific jobs/roles? (Eph 6:5-8)
-   **The Command for Spiritual Diligence:**
    -   2 Thessalonians 3:10 - "...if any would not work, neither should he eat."
        -   Context: Disorderly conduct, neglecting responsibilities while expecting support.
        -   Principle applies broadly: Responsibility accompanies blessing.
        `[Whiteboard: 2 Thess 3:10 -> Responsibility linked to Provision (Temporal & Spiritual)]`
    -   Matthew 25:1-13 - Parable of the Ten Virgins.
        -   Focus: Preparation, active waiting, spiritual readiness.
        -   The foolish virgins were inactive, unprepared (lacked oil - Holy Spirit, character).
        -   `[Whiteboard: Matt 25:1-13 -> Wise = Prepared, Active Faith; Foolish = Inactive, Presumptuous]`
        -   **(RQ)** What does the 'oil' represent for us today, and how do we diligently obtain it according to Scripture? (Matt 25:4, cf. Gal 5:22-23, Acts 1:8)
    -   `[Aside: Just as neglecting daily chores leads to a messy home, neglecting daily connection with God—prayer, study—leads to a spiritually unprepared heart. It's the small, consistent efforts that build readiness.]`
-   **Areas of Spiritual Diligence:**
    -   Prayer (1 Thess 5:17)
    -   Bible Study (2 Tim 2:15)
    -   Witnessing/Sharing Faith (Acts 1:8)
    -   Faithful Stewardship (Mal 3:10)

### Section 3: The Sin of Omission & Call to Action (8 min)
-   **Laziness as a Sin of Omission:**
    -   James 4:17 - "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."
    -   Inaction, whether neglecting known duties (temporal or spiritual), is contrary to God's will.
        `[Whiteboard: James 4:17 -> Knowing + Not Doing = Sin (Omission)]`
    -   Applies to: neglecting work ethic, failing to prepare spiritually, failing to witness.
    -   **(RQ)** Where might we be 'knowing to do good' but failing to act, according to James 4:17?
-   **Active Witness Commanded:**
    -   Matthew 28:19-20 - The Great Commission requires *action*.
    -   Our lives (diligence, integrity - Eph 6:5-8) and words should testify.
    -   `[Hypothetical Concept (from Matt 28): Imagine receiving vital, life-saving news. Would we keep it to ourselves? The Gospel demands active sharing.]`
-   **Bridging to Practice:**
    -   The Need: Overcoming inertia, recognizing laziness (temporal/spiritual) as harmful.
    -   The Principle: God calls for diligence in all things, done as unto Him (Col 3:23).
    -   Action Steps (derived from texts):
        1.  **Evaluate:** Honestly assess areas of potential sloth (work, study, prayer, witness) (Prov 6:6).
        2.  **Commit:** Choose one area to improve diligence this week, asking for God's strength (Eph 6:7).
        3.  **Prepare:** Actively seek spiritual 'oil' daily (Matt 25:4) - dedicated time with God.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)
-   Recap: God designed work (Gen 2:15), condemns laziness (Prov 6), calls for diligence in temporal (Eph 6) and spiritual life (Matt 25), done heartily for Him (Col 3:23).
-   Laziness, even spiritual inaction, is a sin of omission (James 4:17).
-   The call isn't to frantic business, but faithful, purposeful diligence motivated by love for Christ.
-   `[Aside: Our daily tasks, however mundane, become acts of worship when done with diligence for God. It's like polishing the furniture in the King's palace – the act itself might be simple, but the One it honors gives it significance.]`
-   Invitation: Let's commit to shaking off spiritual and temporal lethargy, embracing God's call to be diligent workers and watchful believers, preparing for His soon return.
