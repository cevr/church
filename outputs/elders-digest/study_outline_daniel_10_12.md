### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome and opening prayer.
- Context: Daniel's final vision (Ch 10-12), received in old age by the river Hiddekel (Dan 10:1, 4).
- Theme: God pulls back the curtain to reveal His sovereign control, the reality of spiritual warfare, and His ultimate plan for His people amidst earthly chaos and end-time events.
- Relevance: Why is understanding this crucial for us today? (Dan 12:4, 9-10)
- Central Verse Introduction (Dan 12:1) - Hope amidst trouble.

### Section 1: The Unseen Battle & Answered Prayer (Daniel 10) (10 min)
- Daniel's Burden & Prayer: Deep concern for God's people, mourning and fasting (Dan 10:2-3).
- The Glorious Encounter: Vision of a divine being (likely Christ) (Dan 10:5-9). Overwhelming.
- Encouragement & Insight:
    - Prayer Heard Immediately: "Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day... thy words were heard" (Dan 10:12). `[Write on board: Prayer Heard (Dan 10:12)]`
    - The Unseen Reality: The Great Controversy revealed. Angelic messenger delayed by conflict with the 'prince of Persia' (demonic power), aided by Michael (Christ) (Dan 10:13, 20-21). `[Whiteboard: Great Controversy - Angels vs Demons (Dan 10:13)]`
    - **(RQ)** How does knowing this intense, unseen spiritual battle impacts our understanding of prayer and world events?
    - God's response is certain, even if seemingly delayed by cosmic conflict.

### Section 2: Prophetic Panorama & God's Control (Daniel 11) [*] (12 min)
- God Reveals the Future: Detailed prophecy outlining conflicts between successive world powers (Persia, Greece, divisions, Rome, Papal influence) (Dan 11:2-35 - brief overview).
    - Purpose: Not just history, but demonstration of God's foreknowledge and sovereignty. `[Write on board: God Knows the End (Dan 11)]`
    - God remains in control despite human ambition and rebellion.
    - **(RQ)** Seeing God accurately map centuries of complex history, can we trust His guidance for the unknown future?
- Focus on God's People in Conflict:
    - Times of testing and persecution described (Dan 11:32-35).
    - The Role of the 'Wise': "the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits. And they that understand among the people shall instruct many" (Dan 11:32b-33a). `[Write on board: The Wise (Dan 11:33) = Know God -> Strong -> Understand -> Instruct]`
    - Purpose of Trials: To refine, purify, and make white (Dan 11:35). `[Analogy (from 1 Pet 1:7): Refining fire purifies gold - trials, under God's hand, purify character for His kingdom.]`
    - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]`

### Section 3: The Climax: Trouble, Deliverance, Resurrection (Daniel 12) (12 min)
- The Final Crisis:
    - Michael Stands Up: Christ's intervention for His people (Dan 12:1a). `[Whiteboard: Michael Stands Up = Deliverance]`
    - The Great Time of Trouble: Unprecedented distress (Dan 12:1b). `[Write on board: Time of Trouble (Dan 12:1)]` (cf. Matt 24:21-22).
    - Divine Deliverance: "thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book" (Dan 12:1c). Connection to God's judgment records (Investigative Judgment implied). **(RQ)** What does it mean practically to ensure our names are written, and remain, in the Book of Life? (cf. Rev 3:5, Phil 4:3)
- The Glorious Hope:
    - The Two Resurrections: Certainty of resurrection for both righteous and wicked (Dan 12:2). `[Write on board: Two Resurrections (Dan 12:2) -> Everlasting Life / Everlasting Contempt]`
    - The Reward of the Wise: Those who are wise (understand God's truth) and turn many to righteousness will shine brightly forever (Dan 12:3). `[Whiteboard: Wise = Turn many to Righteousness -> Shine like Stars (Dan 12:3)]` Link to character perfection and evangelism.
- End-Time Understanding:
    - Prophecy Sealed, Then Opened: Daniel's specific time prophecies sealed until the 'time of the end' (Dan 12:4, 9). We live in that time.
    - Purification and Wisdom: "Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand; but the wise shall understand" (Dan 12:10). `[Write on board: Purified -> Understand (Dan 12:10)]`
    - **(RQ)** How does a purified heart (through Christ) enable understanding of divine truth, especially prophecy? (cf. John 7:17)
