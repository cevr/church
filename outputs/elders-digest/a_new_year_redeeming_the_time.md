### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Opening Prayer.
- Acknowledge New Year: Cultural moment for reflection, resolutions.
- Theme Intro: Beyond resolutions - How to make this year spiritually significant?
- Central Idea: God calls us to redeem the time by leaving the past and prioritizing His call.
- Read Central Verse: Philippians 3:13-14.
- [Whiteboard: Title - Redeeming the Time: A New Year, A New Focus]

### Section 1: The Value and Brevity of Time (10 min)
- **The Need:** Time is a precious, non-renewable gift from God.
- **Biblical Principle:** We are stewards of time.
- Scripture Focus: Ephesians 5:15-16
    - "See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
    - Define "circumspectly" (carefully, thoughtfully, wisely).
    - Define "redeeming the time" (buying back, making wise and sacred use of every opportunity).
    - [Whiteboard: Eph 5:15-16 = Walk Wisely + Redeem Time]
    - Why redeem? "Because the days are evil." **(RQ)** How does understanding the spiritual battleground we live on change how we view our minutes and hours?
- Supporting Scripture: Psalm 90:12
    - "So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom."
    - Connect numbering (recognizing brevity) to applying heart (seeking divine wisdom).
    - [Whiteboard: Ps 90:12 = Number Days -> Apply Heart to Wisdom]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Time wasted is opportunity lost for growth and service.
- [Aside: "Time is the currency of eternity. How we spend it here reflects what we truly value and prepares us for the life to come. It's not just about being busy, but about being purposefully engaged in God's work."]
- **Actionable Step:** Prayerfully evaluate daily/weekly schedules. **(RQ)** Where can time be 'redeemed' for spiritual priorities (study, prayer, service)?

### Section 2: Leaving the Past, Pressing Forward [*] (12 min)
- **The Need:** Past sins, failures, regrets (even past successes) can hinder present progress.
- **Biblical Principle:** God offers forgiveness and calls us to look forward in Him.
- Scripture Focus: Philippians 3:13
    - "...forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before..."
    - Explain "forgetting": Not amnesia, but a deliberate choice not to be defined or paralyzed by the past. Releasing it to God.
    - [Whiteboard: Phil 3:13 = Forget Past (Release to God) -> Reach Forward]
    - Connect to God's Forgiveness: Isaiah 43:25 ("I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins."), 1 John 1:9.
    - [Whiteboard: Isa 43:25 / 1 John 1:9 = God Forgives & Forgets]
    - **(RQ)** What specific things from the past (sins confessed, failures learned from, hurts needing forgiveness) do you need to consciously leave behind today by trusting God's grace?
- **Bridging to Practice:** Dwelling on the past steals energy and focus from present duties and future hope.
- [Brief Illustration Concept (from Phil 3:13): Like a runner focused solely on the finish line, not looking back over their shoulder.]
- **Actionable Steps:**
    - Confess any unconfessed sin (1 John 1:9).
    - Consciously choose to accept God's forgiveness and stop dwelling on forgiven failures.
    - If needed, seek reconciliation where possible (Matt 5:23-24).
    - [Whiteboard: Action - Confess, Accept Forgiveness, Look Forward]

### Section 3: Setting Godly Priorities & Responding Now (13 min)
- **The Need:** Without clear, God-given priorities, we drift aimlessly.
- **Biblical Principle:** Our primary focus must be God's kingdom and His call.
- Scripture Focus 1: Philippians 3:14 (continuing from v.13)
    - "I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
    - Emphasize Paul's singular focus: "This one thing I do... I press..."
    - Identify the "mark"/"prize": Conforming to Christ's character, eternal life, fulfilling God's purpose.
    - [Whiteboard: Phil 3:14 = Press Toward Mark (High Calling in Christ)]
- Scripture Focus 2: Matthew 6:33
    - "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
    - Explain "seek ye first": Making God's rule, His character, and His mission the absolute top priority in all decisions.
    - [Whiteboard: Matt 6:33 = Seek FIRST God's Kingdom & Righteousness]
    - **(RQ)** Practically, what does putting God's kingdom 'first' look like when making decisions about career, relationships, finances, or free time?
- [Aside: "Setting priorities isn't just about a to-do list; it's about aligning our deepest desires and daily choices with God's revealed will. When His kingdom is truly first, even mundane tasks take on eternal significance."]
- **The Urgency:** Life is uncertain; God's call requires immediate response.
- Scripture Focus 3: 2 Corinthians 6:2
    - "(...behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)"
    - Emphasize "NOW". Procrastination in spiritual matters is dangerous.
    - [Whiteboard: 2 Cor 6:2 = NOW is the Time!]
    - **(RQ)** Knowing that tomorrow is not promised, how does this impact your response to God's call today?
- **Bridging to Practice/Actionable Steps Recap:**
    - Adopt a God-reliant attitude daily (Proverbs 3:5-6).
    - Consciously value and redeem time (Eph 5:16).
    - Deliberately leave the past with God (Phil 3:13).
    - Prayerfully set/reaffirm spiritual priorities (Matt 6:33).
    - Respond *today* to whatever God is calling you to do (2 Cor 6:2).
    - [Whiteboard: Action Steps - Rely (Prov 3:5), Value Time (Eph 5:16), Leave Past (Phil 3:13), Prioritize God (Matt 6:33), Respond NOW (2 Cor 6:2)]

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)
- **Summary:** This New Year, God invites us to a fresh start grounded in His Word: Value the time He gives, release the past through His forgiveness, press forward with clear spiritual priorities, and respond to His call without delay.
- **Reiterate Central Message:** Like Paul, let's make it our focus: "forgetting those things which are behind... reaching forth... I press toward the mark..." (Phil 3:13-14).
- **Challenge:** Will this year be different? It requires a conscious choice to align with God's principles.
- **Gentle Appeal:**
    - If you haven't accepted Jesus as Savior, *now* is the accepted time (2 Cor 6:2). Don't delay.
    - If you are a believer, recommit *today* to seeking His kingdom first (Matt 6:33) and pressing toward His high calling (Phil 3:14).
- **Closing Prayer:** Prayer for forgiveness, guidance, wisdom to redeem the time, strength to leave the past, and commitment to seek God first throughout the coming year.
