### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Contrast fleeting worldly happiness vs. deep, abiding joy. Where
  does true joy come from? **(RQ)**
- Introduce the narrative: A powerful Syrian general, Naaman, has everything...
  except health and true peace (2 Kings 5:1).
- Introduce the theme: Exploring the journey to experiencing the _personal joy_
  of salvation and the call to share it, using Naaman's story.
- [Write on board: Topic - Tasting & Sharing Salvation's Joy]
- Central Question: How does encountering the true God transform a life from the
  inside out? [Ref: 2 Kings 5:15]

### Section 1: The Need & The Unlikely Witness (10 min)

- **The Need (The Question):** Naaman's leprosy symbolizes sin – pervasive,
  incurable by human means, separating from community (Leviticus 13:45-46).
  [Ref: 2 Kings 5:1]
  - Point: Worldly status and possessions do not guarantee spiritual well-being
    or solve our deepest problems (Naaman). [Ref: 2 Kings 5:1]
  - [Whiteboard: Naaman = Power + Position + Problem (Leprosy/Sin)]
- **The Unlikely Witness (The Biblical Principle):** A young captive servant
  girl holds the key (2 Kings 5:2-3).
  - Point: Lack of worldly status does not prevent spiritual richness or
    usefulness in God's service (Servant Girl). [Ref: 2 Kings 5:2]
  - Her simple faith and testimony: "Would God that my lord were with the
    prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of his leprosy." (2
    Kings 5:3).
  - Point: Believers are called to witness regardless of circumstances, pointing
    others to God's power. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:3; cf. Acts 1:8]
  - [Whiteboard: Servant Girl = Low Status + Faith + Witness -> Hope]
  - **Character Building:** Her faithfulness and compassion in difficult
    circumstances reflect Christ's character. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:2-3; cf.
    Philippians 2:3-5]
  - **Evangelism:** Her personal witness is the catalyst for Naaman seeking God
    – the essence of personal evangelism. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:3-4]
- **Bridging to Practice:** How often do we underestimate the power of simple,
  faithful testimony? **(RQ)** Do we believe God can use _us_, right where we
  are, just like this girl? **(RQ)** [Ref: 1 Corinthians 1:27-29]

### Section 2: Obstacles to Receiving God's Gift (12 min)

- **The Human Response (The Need/Question):** Naaman arrives expecting a grand
  display, bringing payment (2 Kings 5:5, 9). He has preconceived notions of how
  God should work.
  - The King of Israel's reaction: Despair, misunderstanding God's power working
    through His prophet (2 Kings 5:7).
  - Point: Mere knowledge about God without personal trust or understanding His
    methods is insufficient (King of Israel). [Ref: 2 Kings 5:7]
- **The Divine Method (The Biblical Principle):** Elisha's simple, humbling
  instruction: "Go and wash in Jordan seven times..." (2 Kings 5:10).
  - Point: God's ways are often not our ways; they require humility and
    obedience, not human spectacle or payment. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:10; Isaiah
    55:8-9]
  - Naaman's reaction: Pride and anger. "Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of
    Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?" (2 Kings 5:11-12). He
    nearly missed his blessing due to pride.
  - [Whiteboard: Naaman's Obstacles: Pride, Preconceptions, Anger vs. God's Way:
    Simplicity, Humility, Obedience]
  - **Illustration:** Imagine needing a complex surgery, but the doctor
    prescribes simple rest and water. Our pride might question it, demanding
    something more 'impressive', yet the simple cure is the effective one. God's
    plan for salvation (faith in Christ) seems simple, yet it's profoundly
    powerful. [Ref: 1 Corinthians 1:18, 21]
- **The Turning Point:** Naaman's servants gently reason with him: "if the
  prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it?" (2
  Kings 5:13).
  - Point: Wise counsel and willingness to reconsider can overcome pride. [Ref:
    2 Kings 5:13; Proverbs 12:15]
  - Naaman chooses humility and obedience. He "dipped himself seven times in
    Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God" (2 Kings 5:14).
  - [Aside: The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in
    Scripture. Dipping seven times signified complete obedience to God's
    specific instruction.]

### Section 3: The Experience & Joyful Response [*] (12 min)

- **The Transformation (The Biblical Principle):** Immediate and complete
  healing: "his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he
  was clean." (2 Kings 5:14).
  - Point: Obedience to God's specific command, even when it seems illogical,
    brings His blessing and transformation. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:14]
  - This physical cleansing points to the spiritual cleansing from sin available
    through Christ. [Ref: Titus 3:5; 1 John 1:9]
- **The Testimony (Bridging):** Naaman returns a changed man, not just
  physically, but spiritually. His declaration: "...behold, now I know that
  there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel..." (2 Kings 5:15).
  - Point: Experiencing God's grace personally leads to heartfelt testimony and
    worship. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:15; Romans 10:9-10]
  - [Whiteboard: Experience (Obedience -> Healing) -> Testimony ("Now I know!")]
- **The Free Gift (Biblical Principle):** Naaman offers payment, but Elisha
  refuses: "As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none." (2
  Kings 5:16).
  - Point: Salvation and God's blessings are free gifts, not earned or
    purchased. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 6:23b]
  - **Illustration:** Trying to pay for a gift someone freely offers cheapens
    the gesture and misunderstands the giver's heart. Salvation is God's free
    gift; trying to earn it misses the point of grace. [Ref: Romans 3:24]
  - [Aside: Gehazi's later greed (2 Kings 5:20-27) provides a stark contrast,
    showing the danger of trying to profit from God's grace.]
- **Sharing the Joy (Actionable Step):** Naaman wants to take earth back to
  Syria to worship Jehovah (2 Kings 5:17) – a desire to continue his connection
  and implicitly share his discovery.
  - Point: Genuine conversion leads to a desire to live for God and share the
    newfound knowledge. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:17; Matthew 5:16]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen Naaman's journey: recognizing need (sin/leprosy),
  hearing a simple witness, overcoming pride, obeying God's simple command,
  experiencing transformation, and joyfully testifying. [Recap whiteboard
  points]
- **Key Takeaway:** Salvation is a personal experience, freely offered by God
  through Christ, received through humble faith and obedience, resulting in
  cleansing, joy, and a desire to share. [Ref: 2 Kings 5:14-16; Romans 10:9-10]
- **Actionable Steps (Summary):**
  1.  **Be a Simple Witness:** Like the servant girl, share the hope you have,
      pointing people to God's power, regardless of your circumstance. [Ref: 2
      Kings 5:3; Matthew 5:16]
  2.  **Embrace Humble Obedience:** Like Naaman eventually did, set aside pride
      and follow God's instructions found in His Word, even the simple ones.
      [Ref: 2 Kings 5:13-14; John 14:15]
  3.  **Share the Free Gift:** Like Elisha demonstrated, understand and share
      that salvation is a free gift, not based on works or payment. [Ref: 2
      Kings 5:16; Romans 6:23b]
- **Invitation:** Have you personally experienced the cleansing and joy that
  comes from trusting and obeying God? **(RQ)** Perhaps pride or preconceived
  ideas have held you back? Today, like Naaman, you can choose humility, accept
  God's simple plan of salvation through Jesus, and experience His transforming
  power. [Ref: Romans 10:9] Let His joy fill you, and let that light shine to
  others. [Ref: Matthew 5:16]
- **Final Thought:** From leprosy to life, from despair to declaration – this
  transformation is available to all who come to the true God. [Ref: 2 Kings
  5:15]
