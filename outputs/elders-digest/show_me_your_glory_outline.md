### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Moses' profound request (Ex 33:18). What drove him? What does it
  mean for _us_ to desire to see God?
- **Defining Glory:** More than light/power. It's God's essential nature: His
  character, presence, goodness.
  - `[Write on board: GLORY (Ex 33:18) = Character, Presence, Goodness (Ex 33:19)]`
- **Our Quest:** Where can we encounter God's glory today? How does truly
  _seeing_ Him change us?
- **Roadmap:** Explore biblical avenues of revelation, culminating in Christ,
  and understand the transformative impact.

### Section 1: Avenues of Revelation (12 min)

- **A. Nature's Testimony:** God's 'first book'.

  - Psalm 19:1 - Creation declares His glory. Design, power, majesty.
    - `[Whiteboard: Nature -> Declares Glory (Ps 19:1)]`
  - Romans 1:20 - Invisible attributes (eternal power, Godhead) made visible.
    - **(RQ)** Do we consciously 'read' this revelation, or just see scenery?
  - _Practical:_ Schedule time to observe nature intentionally. Look for God's
    signature.

- **B. Moral Order & God's Law:** His character in principles.

  - Galatians 6:7 - Law of sowing/reaping reveals divine justice and order.
    - `[Whiteboard: Moral Order -> Justice/Character (Gal 6:7)]`
  - God's Law (Exodus 20) as a transcript of His character (love, justice,
    holiness).
    - The Sabbath (Ex 31:13, Ez 20:12, 20) - A specific sign pointing to His
      creative & redemptive glory, His authority, His sanctifying power.
    - `[Write: Law (Ex 20) = Character; Sabbath = Sign of Glory/Authority]`
  - **(RQ)** How does aligning our lives with His law demonstrate His glory
    _through_ us?
  - _Practical:_ Acknowledge cause/effect in choices. Seek alignment with His
    revealed will (Law).

- **C. Corporate Worship & Fellowship:** His presence among His people.
  - Hebrews 10:25 - Commanded assembly. Why? Mutual encouragement, collective
    witness.
  - Matthew 18:20 - Christ's promised presence where two or three gather in His
    name.
    - `[Whiteboard: Worship/Fellowship -> Promised Presence (Heb 10:25; Matt 18:20)]`
  - The Church Body (Eph 4:11-16): Healthy function, unity, love reflects
    Christ's character to the world.
  - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]`
  - _Practical:_ Prioritize faithful attendance. Engage, serve, build unity.

### Section 2: The Supreme Revelation - Jesus Christ [*] (12 min)

- **A. The Incarnation: Glory Embodied:**

  - John 1:14 - The Word became flesh, tabernacled among us. We _beheld_ His
    glory – full of grace and truth.
    - `[Write on board: JESUS = Glory Incarnate (John 1:14)]`
  - John 14:9 - Seeing Jesus = Seeing the Father. The clearest revelation of
    God's character.
    - **(RQ)** What specific aspects of the Father's character shine brightest
      in Jesus' life and ministry? (Mercy, justice, patience, love,
      self-sacrifice).
  - Hebrews 1:3 - Jesus is the "brightness of [God's] glory, and the express
    image of his person." He is the perfect representation.
    - _Illustration Concept:_ Like comparing a detailed photograph (Nature/Law)
      to meeting the person face-to-face (Jesus). Both reveal something, but one
      is far more complete and personal.

- **B. Christ's Life and Ministry: Glory Demonstrated:**
  - His teachings revealed the Father's heart (Matthew 5-7 - Sermon on the
    Mount: Kingdom character).
  - His actions showed God's compassion and power (Mark 1:40-42 - Healing leper;
    John 11:35, 43-44 - Weeping, raising Lazarus).
  - His sacrifice displayed ultimate love and justice (Romans 5:8; 1 John 4:10).
    - `[Whiteboard: Jesus' Life -> Character in Action (Love, Mercy, Justice)]`
  - Philippians 2:5-8 - His humility and obedience reveal the self-sacrificing
    nature of God's glory.
  - **(RQ)** How does studying the _details_ of Christ's interactions change our
    perception of God's glory?
  - _Practical:_ Read a Gospel account this week specifically looking for
    demonstrations of God's character in Jesus.

### Section 3: Beholding and Reflecting Glory (10 min)

- **A. The Transformative Gaze:**

  - **Need/Question:** We've seen _where_ God reveals His glory, especially in
    Jesus. But how does this impact _us_? (2 Cor 3:18a)
  - **Biblical Principle:** 2 Corinthians 3:18 - "But we all, with open face
    beholding as in a glass [mirror] the glory of the Lord, are changed into the
    same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
    - `[Write on board: Beholding (Jesus) -> Becoming (Changed) (2 Cor 3:18)]`
  - Beholding = Focused contemplation on Christ (His character, sacrifice,
    teachings) through Scripture and prayer.
  - Changed = Gradual transformation into His likeness. Not our effort, but the
    Spirit's work as we focus on Him.
  - `[Aside: Think of how Moses' face shone after being in God's presence (Ex 34:29). While not literal for us, time spent focusing on Christ should increasingly reflect His character in our lives.]`

- **B. Reflecting His Character:**

  - **Bridging:** This transformation isn't just internal; it's meant to be
    seen. We become living testimonies.
  - Galatians 5:22-23 - The Fruit of the Spirit (love, joy, peace...) are
    reflections of Christ's character, His glory, manifested in us.
  - Matthew 5:16 - "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
    good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven." Our changed lives
    point others to God.
  - _Illustration Concept:_ A clean mirror doesn't generate light, but it
    accurately reflects the light source (the Sun/Son). Our lives reflect
    Christ's glory when we are focused on Him and cleansed by His grace.

- **C. Practical Application:**
  - **Actionable Steps (derived from 2 Cor 3:18, Gal 5:22-23, Matt 5:16):**
    1.  **Daily Beholding:** Dedicate specific time daily to study Christ's life
        and character in the Gospels.
    2.  **Prayerful Reflection:** Ask the Holy Spirit to reveal areas where your
        character doesn't align with Christ's and to empower change.
    3.  **Intentional Witness:** Look for opportunities to demonstrate the Fruit
        of the Spirit (kindness, patience, etc.) in interactions, consciously
        reflecting His glory.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We began with Moses' plea, "Show me Your glory" (Ex 33:18). We've
  seen God reveals His character (His glory) through nature (Ps 19:1), His law
  (Ex 20), fellowship (Heb 10:25), but supremely and perfectly in Jesus Christ
  (John 1:14, 14:9; Heb 1:3).
- **The Core:** Seeking God's glory is seeking to know His character – His
  goodness, love, justice, mercy.
- **The Transformation:** The most incredible truth is that as we behold Jesus,
  we are changed into His image by the Spirit (2 Cor 3:18). We don't just _see_
  glory; we begin to _reflect_ it.
- **Invitation:** Do you share Moses' longing? Do you desire to see God's glory
  more clearly? The path is Jesus. Will you commit today to intentionally behold
  Him more through His Word? Will you allow His Spirit to transform you, so His
  glory – His beautiful character – shines through your life? Let's seek Him
  together.
