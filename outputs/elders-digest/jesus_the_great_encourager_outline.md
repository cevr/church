- **Divine Answer: Christ Alone** (v. 6).
  - "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but
    by me."

  by Father & Son, and experiences God's presence (v. 21, 23).
  - Obedience invites intimacy with God.
- **The Counter-Proof:** Not keeping His words = Not loving Him (v. 24).
  - A clear diagnostic for self-examination.
- `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.

    unto you" (v. 26b).

  - "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you..."
    `[Write on board: Promise 4: Christ's Peace (v.27)]`
  - **Distinct Source & Nature:** "not as the world giveth, give I unto you."

  - Christ's peace: internal, steadfast, rooted in relationship and trust,
    present _amidst_ conflict.
    `[Analogy (from v.27): Christ's peace like a deep ocean calm beneath surface storms vs. world's peace like a temporary cease-fire.]`

  afraid" (v. 27b).
  - Possible because of His imparted peace.
  - ** (RQ)** What practical steps can we take to _receive_ and _maintain_ this
    supernatural peace when facing trials?
- **Contextual Reassurance:** His going away leads to the Father and eventual
  return (v. 28-29). Prophecy fulfilled builds faith.
- **Jesus' Example:** His obedience to the Father demonstrates His love and
  provides the ultimate model (v. 31).
- `[Aside: This peace isn't apathy; it's active trust. It allows us to face trials not with numb resignation, but with the quiet confidence that God is sovereign and His promises (like the Second Coming) are sure, even when everything around us seems chaotic.]`
