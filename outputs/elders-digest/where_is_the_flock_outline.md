### Introduction (5 min)

-   Start with the direct question: Jeremiah 13:20. God asks leaders, "Where is the flock...?"
-   Who is the "flock" today? Our children, students, youth in the church.
-   Who are the shepherds? Parents, teachers, pastors, elders, Sabbath School teachers.
-   Purpose of Study: To understand our solemn, biblical responsibility and accountability for the spiritual well-being of the youth entrusted to us.
-   [Write on board: Accountability - Jer 13:20]

### Section 1: The Solemn Charge (Jer 13:20) (10 min)

-   **The Need/Question:** God holds leaders accountable. Are we aware of this divine expectation?
-   **Biblical Principle (Jer 13:20):**
    -   Read Jeremiah 13:20. Context: Warning to Judah's negligent leaders before judgment.
    -   Emphasis: "given thee" - a stewardship; "thy beautiful flock" - precious in God's sight.
    -   [Write on board: Jer 13:20 - "Where is the flock... thy beautiful flock?"]
    -   Principle: Divine Accountability is real and personal.
-   **Bridging to Practice:**
    -   This isn't just ancient history. The principle applies directly to us *now*.
    -   The 'north' today represents worldly influences, false teachings, spiritual dangers attacking our youth.
    -   **(RQ)** Are we actively watching, aware of where our 'flock' is spiritually?
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    -   Acknowledge this God-given responsibility personally.
    -   Begin praying specifically for the youth under your influence by name.
-   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our homes, schools, and churches represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture, especially in how we care for the young.

### Section 2: The Flock's Value & Danger (Matt 18) [*] (10 min)

-   **The Need/Question:** How does God view children, and what dangers must we guard against?
-   **Biblical Principle (Matt 18:5-6, 10):**
    -   Read Matt 18:5-6, 10. Jesus elevates children.
    -   Receiving a child in His name = Receiving Him (v. 5).
    -   [Write on board: Matt 18:10 - "Their angels... behold the face of my Father"] -> Shows their immense value.
    -   Stern Warning: Causing little ones who believe to stumble (v. 6). Millstone analogy shows severity.
-   **Bridging to Practice:**
    -   **(RQ)** What constitutes 'stumbling blocks' today? (Hypocrisy, worldliness, neglect of spiritual training, prioritizing academics/sports over faith).
    -   Satan actively targets the young and vulnerable. We must be spiritually alert.
    -   [Concept (from Matt 18:6): Millstone - Illustrates the eternal consequences of leading youth astray through our example or neglect.]
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    -   Examine our own lives for potential stumbling blocks.
    -   Prioritize creating a spiritually safe and nurturing environment.

### Section 3: The Shepherd's Heart & Method (1 Pet 5, Eph 6, Titus 2) (12 min)

-   **The Need/Question:** *How* should we care for and lead the youth?
-   **Biblical Principle (1 Pet 5:2-4; Eph 6:4; Titus 2:11-13):**
    -   Read 1 Pet 5:2-4. Shepherd's Attitude: Willingly, eagerly, being examples, not domineering.
    -   [Write on board: Shepherd Qualities (1 Pet 5) - Willing, Eager, Example]
    -   Read Eph 6:4. Shepherd's Method: "Nurture" (training, discipline) + "Admonition" (instruction, warning) *of the Lord*. Grounded in God's Word, not human wisdom.
    -   [Whiteboard: Eph 6:4 - Nurture + Admonition = God's Way]
    -   Connect to Spirit of Prophecy: Christlike nurture = kindness, patience, tenderness (*CPTS*, 41-42). This *is* the Lord's way.
    -   **Adding End-Time Context:** Read Titus 2:11-13. Grace teaches us *how* to live now (soberly, righteously, godly) *while* looking for Christ's return.
    -   [Whiteboard: Titus 2:11-13 -> Grace teaches Present Godliness + Future Hope]
-   **Bridging to Practice:**
    -   Our nurture must include preparing youth for the unique challenges of the last days.
    -   **(RQ)** Are we intentionally teaching them the Three Angels' Messages, the Sanctuary truth, the nature of the Investigative Judgment, and God's standard of righteousness so they can stand firm?
    -   This requires diligence, personal study, and dependence on the Holy Spirit.
    -   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season [or any opportunity] to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Opportunities abound for sharing truth relevant to these times.
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    -   Model Christlike character consistently.
    -   Intentionally incorporate Bible study and prayer *with* youth.
    -   Teach present truth with clarity and urgency, connecting it to daily life.

### Conclusion & Appeal (Heb 2:13) (8 min)

-   **The Ultimate Goal:** Read Hebrews 2:13. The joy of presenting those God entrusted to us: "Behold I and the children which God hath given me."
-   This requires leading them to a *personal*, saving relationship with Jesus Christ.
-   Our role: Point them to the Lamb of God, the Perfect Shepherd.
-   [Briefly summarize illustrative story concept: Passionate, unwavering effort needed for soul-saving, especially for our youth.]
-   **Final Encouragement & Challenge:**
    -   Remember the solemn charge (Jer 13:20).
    -   Embrace the Christlike method (1 Pet 5, Eph 6).
    -   Prepare them for His soon return (Titus 2:13).
    -   Aim for the eternal joy (Heb 2:13).
-   **Invitation:**
    -   Commit today to being a more faithful shepherd.
    -   Ask God for wisdom, patience, and love.
    -   **(RQ)** Will you answer God's call to diligently nurture His beautiful flock for eternity?
