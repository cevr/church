### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: The unique pressures and opportunities of living in earth's final days.
  **(RQ)** What kind of disciples does Christ need now?
- Introduce Mark 3:13-19 as Christ's foundational model for discipleship.
- Core Thesis: Jesus established a divine order – first being _with_ Him for
  transformation, _then_ being sent _by_ Him for service. This is crucial for
  the final generation.
- Brief overview of the study's flow: Come (Relationship), Transform
  (Character), Go (Mission).

### Section 1: The Call to Come - Being With Him (12 min)

- **The Prerequisite:** Jesus calls disciples _first_ to Himself (Mark
  3:13-14a).
  - `[Whiteboard: Mark 3:14a - "that they should be WITH HIM"]`
  - Primary purpose: Relationship, learning His ways, absorbing His Spirit.
  - **(RQ)** What does it practically mean for us today to 'be with Him'?
- **The Vital Connection:** John 15:4-5 - The command to 'Abide'.
  - `[Whiteboard: John 15:4-5 - Abide = Remain Connected]`
  - Emphasis: Fruitfulness (service, character) is impossible without this
    connection.
  - `[Analogy (from John 15): Branch & Vine - life flows *from* the vine *to* the branch. Severance = powerlessness.]`
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - Need/Question (from life & text): We feel powerless or ineffective. **(RQ)**
    Could it be a disconnect from the Source (John 15:5)?
  - Biblical Principle (from John 15:4): Power for life and service flows _only_
    through constant connection with Christ.
  - Bridging to Practice: This isn't just theology; it's the daily reality of
    dependence.
  - Action Steps (derived from John 15):
    `[Whiteboard: Action: Daily Connection]`
    - 1. Prioritize meaningful time in the Word and prayer daily.
    - 2. Consciously surrender personal plans/will throughout the day.
    - 3. Actively acknowledge dependence on Him for _everything_.

### Section 2: Transformation Through Companionship [*] (10 min)

- **The Result of Abiding:** Being _with_ Jesus leads to transformation.
  - It's more than intellectual knowledge; it's character change (becoming like
    Him).
  - Context: The Great Controversy - God's aim is restoring His image in
    humanity. `[Write on board: Goal = Restored Image (Gen 1:27)]`
- **Grace and Works:** Ephesians 2:8-10 clarifies the divine order.
  - `[Whiteboard: Eph 2:8-10: Grace -> Salvation -> Good Works (Prepared)]`
  - We are saved _by_ grace, _unto_ good works prepared by God – works flowing
    from a changed heart.
- **The Mechanism of Change:** 1 John 3:2-3 - Beholding Him purifies.
  - `[Whiteboard: 1 John 3:2-3 - Hope in Christ -> Purification]`
  - Focusing on Christ, His character, His sacrifice, transforms us by the
    Spirit's power (Ref. 2 Cor 3:18).
  - `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies...]` Our lives, transformed by time with
    the King, should represent the principles of His kingdom, not the
    surrounding culture.
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - Need/Question (from life & text): How does real character change happen?
    **(RQ)** Can we truly reflect Christ if we aren't being changed into His
    likeness?
  - Biblical Principle (from 1 John 3:3, Eph 2:10): Hope in Christ and abiding
    in Him leads to active purification and readiness for God's prepared works.
  - Bridging to Practice: Transformation is a cooperative process fueled by
    relationship.
  - Action Steps (derived from 1 John 3, Eph 2):
    `[Whiteboard: Action: Behold, Pray, Cooperate]`
    - 1. Intentionally study Christ's life and character in the Gospels.
    - 2. Pray specifically for the Holy Spirit to develop Christ-like traits.
    - 3. Actively cooperate when the Spirit convicts of sin or prompts towards
         righteousness.

### Section 3: The Call to Go - Sent Forth for the Final Hour (12 min)

- **The Purpose of Transformation:** Mark 3:14b - "...and that he might send
  them forth to preach".
  - `[Whiteboard: Mark 3:14b - "SEND THEM FORTH"]`
  - The Divine Order is critical: Being _with_ Him qualifies and empowers us to
    _go_ for Him.
  - **(RQ)** Why is attempting service _before_ genuine connection and
    transformation ineffective or even dangerous?
- **The Mandate:** Matthew 28:19-20 - The Great Commission.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 28:19-20 - Go, Teach All Nations, Make Disciples]`
  - This applies to _all_ disciples, empowered by His presence ("I am with you
    alway").
- **The Message for _Now_:** Revelation 14:6-7 - The First Angel's Message (as
  part of the Three Angels' Messages).
  - `[Whiteboard: Rev 14:6-7 - Everlasting Gospel + Fear God, Give Glory, Judgment Hour]`
  - Our 'going' has specific content: God's final, urgent call to the world.
  - **(RQ)** How does 'being with Him' prepare us to understand and share this
    specific message?
  - `[Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...]` Just as the disciples
    used common means (walking, talking), we use our resources and
    opportunities, directing them toward sharing God's final warning and
    invitation.
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - Need/Question (from text & time): What is our specific mission in these last
    days?
  - Biblical Principle (from Rev 14, Matt 28): Transformed disciples are sent
    with the Everlasting Gospel, specifically framed by the Three Angels'
    Messages for the judgment hour.
  - Bridging to Practice: Our witness isn't generic; it carries God's unique,
    time-sensitive truths.
  - Action Steps (derived from Rev 14, Matt 28):
    `[Whiteboard: Action: Study 3AMs, Pray for Openings, Live Consistently]`
    - 1. Diligently study the Three Angels' Messages to understand them deeply.
    - 2. Pray daily for divine appointments and wisdom to share aspects of this
         truth.
    - 3. Strive to live a life consistent with the call to "Fear God and give
         glory to him".

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Reiterate the inseparable connection from Mark 3:14 - We are
  called _to_ Christ (relationship, transformation) which is the _only_ basis
  for being effectively sent _by_ Christ (mission, specific message).
- **Urgency:** Emphasize the critical need _today_ for authentic discipleship
  rooted in 'being with Him'. This is essential for personal readiness and for
  fulfilling God's purpose in the Great Controversy's closing scenes.
- **Final Thought:** The world needs to see not just our message, but the
  _result_ of that message in lives transformed by 'being with Jesus'.
- **Appeal:** Make a personal commitment _today_ to prioritize daily, quality
  time 'with Him'. Answer the call to _come_ fully, so you can powerfully answer
  the call to _go_ in this final hour.
