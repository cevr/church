### Introduction (5 min)

- The King's Troubling Dream (Dan 2:1-3)
  - A world leader disturbed, seeking answers for the future (v. 1, 29b).
- Human Wisdom Fails (Dan 2:4-13)
  - Astrologers, magicians unable to reveal/interpret (v. 10-11).
  - Shows limitation of human insight into divine matters.
    `[Write on board: Human Wisdom (Limited) vs. Divine Revelation (Unlimited)]`
- Contrast: God Knows the Future (Dan 2:28)
  - Introduce central theme: Only God reveals and controls the future.
  - **(RQ)** Why couldn't the wisest men of Babylon solve this? What does this
    tell us about seeking answers apart from God (cf. Jer 17:5)?

### Main Content 1: The Crisis & God's Revelation (10 min) - Dan 2:1-30

- Daniel's Response: Faith and Prayer (Dan 2:14-19)
  - Facing death decree, Daniel seeks God, not despair (v. 14-16).
  - Importance of prayer and fellowship in crisis (v. 17-18).
  - God answers prayer, revealing the secret (v. 19).
- God, The Revealer of Secrets (Dan 2:20-23, 27-30)
  - Daniel gives ALL glory to God (v. 20-23, 28a, 30).
  - `[Write on board: Dan 2:20-22 - God's Sovereignty: Wisdom, Power, Revelation, Control over Times/Kings]`
  - God's purpose: To make known "what shall be in the latter days" (v. 28b,
    29b). He wants us to know the outline of history leading to His kingdom.
  - **(RQ)** How does Daniel's immediate response of praise (v. 20-23) challenge
    our own reactions when God answers prayer?

### Main Content 2: History Foretold - The Image [*] (12 min) - Dan 2:31-43

- The Great Image Described (Dan 2:31-35)
  - A fearsome statue representing successive world powers (v. 31).
  - Decreasing value (gold to iron/clay), increasing strength (initially), then
    division/brittleness.
  - `[Write on board: Simple sketch of image: Head (Gold), Chest/Arms (Silver), Belly/Thighs (Bronze), Legs (Iron), Feet (Iron/Clay)]`
- The Interpretation: Kingdoms Revealed (Dan 2:36-43)
  - **Head of Gold:** Babylon (Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom) (v. 37-38). Supreme but
    temporary.
  - **Chest/Arms of Silver:** Medo-Persia (v. 39a). Inferior in glory, replaced
    Babylon (cf. Dan 5).
  - **Belly/Thighs of Bronze:** Greece (Alexander's empire) (v. 39b). Ruled the
    known world.
  - **Legs of Iron:** Rome (v. 40). Strong, crushing power, ruled with force.
  - **Feet of Iron & Clay:** Divided Europe (v. 41-43). Mixture of strength
    (iron) and weakness (clay), attempts to unite fail ("shall not cleave one to
    another").
  - **Brief Illustration:** Think of building materials. Gold is precious but
    soft. Iron is strong but less valuable. Clay is brittle. The image shows a
    decline in value but also inherent instability leading to fragmentation.
  - `[Aside: Historicist Interpretation - This understanding of Daniel 2 as representing these specific successive empires is a cornerstone of SDA prophetic interpretation, affirmed by history.]`
  - **(RQ)** Seeing this clear historical fulfillment, how does it impact our
    confidence in the parts of prophecy yet to come (v. 44-45)?

### Main Content 3: The Unshakeable Kingdom & Our Response (12 min) - Dan 2:44-49

- **Need/Question (from text):** In a world of crumbling empires and shifting
  powers (v. 31-43), where can lasting hope and security be found?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** The Stone Kingdom (Dan 2:34-35, 44-45)
  - A kingdom established _not_ by human hands ("cut out without hands") (v. 34,
    45). Divine origin.
  - It strikes the image on the feet (representing the time of divided nations)
    (v. 34).
  - It utterly destroys and replaces _all_ previous earthly kingdoms (v. 35,
    44a).
  - This kingdom "shall never be destroyed" and "shall stand for ever" (v. 44b).
    `[Write on board: God's Kingdom: Divine Origin, Destructive Power, Eternal Duration]`
- **Bridging (from text):** The prophecy shows that human history, with all its
  power struggles, is heading towards a divine climax. Just as Nebuchadnezzar's
  kingdom passed, and Rome passed, so will the current world order. Our ultimate
  citizenship and hope must be in God's eternal kingdom (cf. Philippians 3:20).
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  **Anchor Faith in God's Word:** Trust the prophetic outline God has
      revealed; it confirms His sovereignty over history (Dan 2:28, 45b).
  2.  **Set Allegiance on the Eternal:** Recognize the temporary nature of
      earthly powers and invest hope in God's coming, everlasting kingdom (Dan
      2:44; cf. Heb 12:28).
  3.  **Live as Citizens of Heaven:** Let the reality of God's final victory
      shape our priorities and conduct today (Dan 2:44 implies a choice of
      allegiance; cf. 1 Peter 2:11).
- `[Aside: Daniel's Elevation (v. 46-49) - Nebuchadnezzar recognized the supremacy of Daniel's God (v. 47). Faithful witness, even in high places, points others to the true God.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Summary: Daniel 2 isn't just ancient history; it's a divine roadmap. God
  revealed the flow of world powers centuries in advance (Dan 2:28-29). Babylon,
  Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome, Divided Europe – all unfolded as predicted.
- The Climax: The most crucial part is the final act – the coming of God's
  eternal kingdom, the stone cut out without hands, which will fill the whole
  earth (Dan 2:44-45).
- **Invitation:** This prophecy confirms God is in control. History is moving
  towards His predetermined end. **(RQ)** Will we align ourselves with the
  temporary kingdoms of this world, destined to crumble like the image, or will
  we place our faith and allegiance in the Rock, Christ Jesus, and His
  everlasting kingdom (Dan 2:44)? Choose today to trust the God who not only
  knows the future but holds it in His hands, and prepare to be citizens of the
  kingdom that will never be destroyed.
