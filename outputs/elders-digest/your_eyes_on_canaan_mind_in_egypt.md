### Introduction (5 min)
- Hook: The paradox - physically moving forward, mentally looking back. Like trying to drive while staring in the rearview mirror.
- Analogy: Israel's journey from Egypt (bondage/sin) to Canaan (promise/heaven) as a type for our spiritual walk.
- State the Problem: A divided mind hinders spiritual progress and jeopardizes the prize (Ref. Hebrews 3:16-19 - Israel's failure to enter).
- Introduce Central Verse: Philippians 3:13-14 - Paul's singular focus. `[Write on board: Phil 3:13-14 - FORGETTING <-> REACHING]`
- **(RQ)** Where is *your* focus today? Egypt or Canaan?

### Section 1: The Danger of a Divided Mind (Egypt in the Heart) (10 min)
- **Biblical Example:** Israel's backward glances.
    - Reading/Summarizing Numbers 14:2-4. What were they *really* asking for when they wanted a captain to lead them back? **(RQ)** (Answer: Rejecting God's leadership for familiar slavery).
    - `[Whiteboard: Egypt = Sin, Worldly Comforts, Past Failures, Fear, Familiar Bondage]`
    - Their focus wasn't on God's power or promise, but on past comforts (often idealized) and present difficulties (Numbers 11:5-6).
    - `[Aside: Remember what they missed? Leeks, onions, garlic (Num 11:5). They preferred the 'flavor' of bondage over the bread of heaven (Manna). What 'flavors' of the world do we sometimes miss more than God's provision?]`
- **Scriptural Warnings:** The peril of looking back.
    - Luke 9:62: "No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
        - Point: Commitment to God's kingdom requires unwavering, forward focus. Looking back (longing for the old life) makes us unfit, ineffective. **(RQ)** Why is looking back incompatible with ploughing straight?

### Section 2: The Call to Renewed Focus (Eyes on Canaan) [*] (12 min)
- **The Solution:** Transformation starts in the mind.
    - Romans 12:2: "And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind..."
        - Point: We must actively resist worldly patterns of thinking (Egypt's influence) and allow God to reshape our thoughts, desires, and focus. `[Write on board: Renewing the Mind -> Transformation]`
        - **(RQ)** How does the world try to conform our thinking today? How can we actively pursue mind renewal through God's Word?
- **The Motivation:** Seeking a better, heavenly country.
    - Hebrews 11:13-16: These all died in faith... confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth... they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly..."
        - Point: Like the patriarchs, our identity as "strangers and pilgrims" should fuel our forward focus. We're not looking for earthly comfort but a heavenly home. `[Whiteboard: Strangers & Pilgrims -> Seeking Heavenly Country]`
        - This heavenly focus helps us "forget" the pull of the past (Egypt).
        - `[Aside: The Greek for "reaching forth" in Phil 3:13 (epekteinomai) implies straining forward intensely, like a runner stretching for the finish line. It's not passive wishing, but active, focused effort.]`
- **The Goal:** The prize of the high calling.
    - Philippians 3:14: "...I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus."
        - Point: Our focus isn't just *away* from Egypt, but *toward* Christ and the eternal life He offers. This positive goal pulls us forward.

### Section 3: Pressing Forward Practically (Leaving Egypt Behind) (12 min)
- **Need/Question (from text):** How do we practically stop looking back and keep our eyes on Canaan when difficulties arise or the past calls?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** God provides guidance and the exclusive path forward through Christ.
    - Jeremiah 3:15: "And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding."
        - Point: God doesn't leave us directionless. He provides spiritual leadership and instruction (through His Word, godly counsel, the Holy Spirit) to guide us toward Canaan. We must *listen* and *follow*.
    - Acts 4:12: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
        - Point: There is NO path back to Egypt that leads to life. The *only* way forward, the *only* source of strength and salvation for the journey, is Jesus Christ. `[Write on board: Jesus = The ONLY Way Forward]`
- **Bridging (from text):** Just as Israel needed to trust God's appointed leader (Moses) and His provision (manna, water from the rock), we need to trust Christ and the means He provides today. Rejecting His way *is* choosing Egypt.
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Daily Re-Focus:** Start each day consciously committing your focus to Christ and His kingdom (Ref Phil 3:13 - "this *one thing* I do"). Pray specifically against worldly distractions or longing for the past.
    2.  **Feed on God's Word:** Actively engage with Scripture to renew your mind (Rom 12:2) and keep God's promises (Canaan) in view, rather than dwelling on past failures or worldly desires (Egypt).
    3.  **Embrace Godly Fellowship/Guidance:** Seek out and heed the "knowledge and understanding" God provides through faithful study, prayer, and potentially trusted spiritual mentors (Ref Jer 3:15). Don't journey alone.
- **Brief Illustration:** Imagine trying to climb a steep hill. Looking down or back increases fear and the temptation to slide back. Looking *up* towards the summit keeps you moving forward. Our spiritual journey is similar.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
- **Summary:** We face a constant choice: allow the difficulties of the journey or the allure of past sins/comforts (Egypt) to dominate our minds, or fix our eyes on the goal – the prize of God's high calling in Christ (Canaan).
- **Reiterate Central Verse:** Philippians 3:13-14 is not just Paul's testimony, it's a command and strategy for every believer. Forget the past, reach forward, press on!
- **(RQ)** What "Egypt" are you still looking back towards? What fear or past comfort is hindering your forward progress towards God's promises?
- **Invitation:** Today, make a conscious decision. Turn your eyes fully away from Egypt. Acknowledge Jesus as the only way (Acts 4:12). Commit to renewing your mind (Rom 12:2) and pressing forward with singular focus (Phil 3:13-14). Choose Canaan. Choose Christ. Let's pray for the strength and focus to keep pressing on toward the mark.
