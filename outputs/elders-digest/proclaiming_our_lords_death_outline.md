### Introduction (5 min)
*   Welcome & Prayer
*   The Ordinance of Humility & Lord's Supper: More than ritual.
*   Introduce Central Verse: 1 Cor 11:26 - What does it mean to "shew" or "proclaim" His death?
*   ** (RQ)** Is this just a memorial, or is it an active declaration?
*   Outline Overview: We proclaim His death by understanding and sharing what it reveals about sin, God's love, our value, and the only path to salvation.
*   [Write on board: 1 Cor 11:26 - "Shew the Lord's Death Till He Come"] 

### Section 1: The Proclamation Itself (1 Cor 11:26) (8 min)
*   **Focus: 1 Cor 11:26** - The command and its duration.
    *   "As often as ye..." - A repeated, conscious act.
    *   "Ye do shew (proclaim)" - An outward testimony, a sermon without words.
    *   "The Lord's death" - The central event of history and salvation.
    *   "Till He come" - Connects the first and second advents; links the cross to the crown.
*   ** (RQ)** How does participating in communion actively *proclaim* something to ourselves? To others? To unseen watchers (Eph 3:10)?
*   [Whiteboard: Proclaim = Declare Publicly; Testimony]
*   This proclamation isn't just remembering; it's understanding and declaring the *meaning* of His death.

### Section 2: What Christ's Death Reveals (Sin, Love, Value) (15 min) [*]
*   **A. The Awfulness and Reality of Sin**
    *   Scripture Focus: 1 Cor 15:3 ("Christ died for our sins"), John 1:29 ("Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world!"), 1 Peter 2:24 ("Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree").
    *   Sin required the ultimate price – the death of God's Son. It's not trivial.
    *   [Whiteboard: SIN (Rom 3:23) -> DEATH (Rom 6:23) -> CHRIST'S DEATH (1 Cor 15:3)]
    *   ** (RQ)** Do we grasp the horror of sin as revealed at Calvary when we treat it lightly?
    *   Affirmation: Christ's substitutionary atonement is central. He took *our* penalty. (1 Peter 2:24)
    *   [Aside: *"Calvary is God's divine commentary on the devastating nature of sin. Every drop of blood shed proclaims sin's lethal reality far more powerfully than any human words ever could."*]

*   **B. The Greatness of God's Love**
    *   Scripture Focus: Romans 5:8 ("But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."), John 3:16 ("For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son...").
    *   Love demonstrated, not just declared. Given at our worst state.
    *   [Whiteboard: GOD'S LOVE (Rom 5:8) = Action, Sacrifice, Unconditional]
    *   ** (RQ)** How does the timing ("while we were yet sinners") magnify the love shown at the cross?
    *   [Analogy (from Rom 5:8): Like a rescuer diving into polluted waters for someone who pushed them away.]

*   **C. The Immense Value of Each Soul**
    *   Scripture Focus: John 3:16 (The scope - "the world"), 1 Peter 1:18-19 (Redeemed not with corruptible things... but precious blood).
    *   The price paid (Christ's life) reveals the value God places on every lost individual.
    *   [Whiteboard: Your Value = Price Paid at Calvary (1 Pet 1:18-19)]
    *   ** (RQ)** If God paid such a price for us, how should that affect how we view ourselves and others?
    *   [Aside: *"We often measure value by worldly standards – wealth, status, appearance. But the cross recalibrates everything. Our true worth is stamped not by human opinion, but by the infinite price Heaven was willing to pay."*]

### Section 3: The Necessary Response (Salvation & Witness) (10 min)
*   **A. The Only Way of Salvation**
    *   Scripture Focus: Acts 4:12 ("Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.").
    *   Proclaiming His death means proclaiming the *exclusive* means of salvation.
    *   [Whiteboard: Cross -> ONLY WAY (Acts 4:12)]
    *   ** (RQ)** Why is acknowledging Christ as the *only* way crucial, not just *a* way?
    *   Necessity of Acceptance: Faith in Christ as our substitute is not optional for salvation (John 3:16b - "whosoever believeth").
    *   [Whiteboard: Faith = Trust + Acceptance of Substitute]

*   **B. The Call to Communicate**
    *   Understanding the depth of His sacrifice and love compels us to share.
    *   Scripture Link: 2 Cor 5:14 ("For the love of Christ constraineth us...").
    *   Proclaiming His death in communion should fuel proclaiming His love in evangelism.
    *   ** (RQ)** If we truly grasp what we proclaim in the Lord's Supper, how can we remain silent?
    *   Practical Steps: How can we "proclaim" His death this week?
        *   Sharing your testimony of what His sacrifice means personally.
        *   Inviting someone to study the meaning of the cross.
        *   Living a life transformed by His grace, pointing others to the source.
    *   [Whiteboard: Action -> Share Testimony, Invite to Study, Live Transformed]

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)
*   Summary: The Lord's Supper is a profound proclamation of sin's reality, God's immense love, our infinite value, and the only way to salvation through Christ's substitutionary death (1 Cor 11:26).
*   Revisit Central Verse: We show His death by understanding its meaning and living in its reality.
*   ** (RQ)** As we prepare for or reflect on the Lord's Supper, are we truly grasping and proclaiming the depth of His sacrifice?
*   Personal Appeal: Have you personally accepted Christ as your substitute, the One who died *for your sins*? Is His death the foundation of your hope?
*   Call to Action: Let the reality proclaimed at the communion table compel us to live lives of gratitude and to share this life-saving message with others, truly proclaiming His death "till He come."
*   Final Prayer.
