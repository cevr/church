### Introduction (5 min)
-   Hook: Contrast the beauty/order of nature (cf. Psalm 19:1) with modern confusion about origins. Where do we find reliable answers? **(RQ)**
-   Purpose: Explore the biblical account of Creation (Gen 1-2), the entrance of sin (Gen 3), and God's plan for restoration (Gen 3:15; Rev 14:7), understanding why these truths are foundational.
-   Central Verse Introduction: Rev 14:7 connects worship directly to God as Creator – a vital message for today, echoing the foundation laid in Genesis.
-   [Whiteboard: Title + Rev 14:7]

### Section 1: The Perfect Beginning (12 min)
-   **God the Creator:**
    -   Affirmation of a literal, recent, six-day Creation week by God's Word (Gen 1:1-31; Psalm 33:6, 9). God spoke, and it stood fast.
    -   [Whiteboard: Gen 1:1 - "In the beginning God created..."]
    -   Each day's work declared 'good'; the completed creation 'very good' (Gen 1:10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). This perfection reflects God's own character (cf. Deut 32:4).
-   **The Pinnacle: Humanity:**
    -   Created uniquely in God's image – likeness (intellect, will, emotion) and character potential (love, righteousness) (Gen 1:26-27). What does it mean to reflect God? **(RQ)** (cf. Eph 4:24)
    -   [Whiteboard: Image of God (Gen 1:26-27) = Likeness (Form/Intellect) + Character Potential (Love/Righteousness)]
-   **The Capstone: The Sabbath:**
    -   God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day (Gen 2:1-3). Not just cessation *from* work, but sanctified time *for* relationship with the Creator (cf. Mark 2:27).
    -   [Whiteboard: Sabbath (Gen 2:1-3) = Memorial of Creation + Sign of Relationship + Blessing]
-   **God's Original Plan:**
    -   Direct relationship with God (Implied by God walking in the Garden - Gen 3:8a).
    -   Holy Marriage: Instituted by God as foundational (Gen 2:20-25).
    -   Stewardship: Given dominion and responsibility to care for creation (Gen 1:28, 2:15).
    -   [Brief Analogy (from Gen 2): The Garden as God's ideal home/school for humanity, designed for growth in relationship and understanding.]

### Section 2: Paradise Lost [*] (10 min)
-   **The Test and the Fall:**
    -   One simple prohibition – a test of loyalty, love, and trust in God's Word (Gen 2:16-17).
    -   Satan's Temptation: Directly questioning God's Word ("Hath God said...?"), God's Character (implying selfishness), and God's Authority (Gen 3:1-5).
    -   The Choice: Disobedience through believing the lie over God's command (Gen 3:6).
    -   [Whiteboard: God's Command (Gen 2:17 - "shall surely die") vs. Serpent's Lie (Gen 3:4 - "shall not surely die")]
-   **The Serpent's Lie:**
    -   "You will not surely die" (Gen 3:4) – the foundational lie of inherent immortality, directly contradicting God's explicit warning (Gen 2:17).
    -   God confirms mortality as the consequence of sin (Gen 3:19, 22; Rom 5:12).
-   **Immediate Consequences:**
    -   Separation from God: Guilt, fear, hiding from His presence (Gen 3:8; Isa 59:2).
    -   Death Enters: The ultimate wage of sin, both spiritual and physical (Rom 6:23a; Gen 3:19).
    -   Broken Relationships: Blame-shifting, conflict replaces harmony (Gen 3:12-13; cf. Gen 4:8).
    -   Conflict with Nature: Creation groans under the curse; toil replaces joyful tending (Gen 3:17-19; Rom 8:22).
    -   How did one act unravel perfection? **(RQ)** It revealed a choice to distrust and disobey the Creator, severing the relationship (Isa 59:2).

### Section 3: Restoration Promised and Provided (12 min)
-   **The First Gospel Promise (Protoevangelium):**
    -   God immediately promises redemption through the Seed of the woman (Christ) (Gen 3:15).
    -   Introduces conflict (enmity) between Satan's influence and God's followers, culminating in Christ's victory through suffering (bruised heel) and Satan's ultimate defeat (crushed head) (Gen 3:15; cf. Heb 2:14).
    -   [Whiteboard: Gen 3:15 - Enmity, Conflict, Bruised Heel (Christ's Sacrifice), Crushed Head (Satan's Defeat)]
    -   The Substitute: This promise points forward to Christ bearing our iniquities (Isa 53:6, 11).
-   **Faith in the Creator's Word:**
    -   Understanding origins requires faith in God's revelation, not just human reasoning or observation alone (Hebrews 11:3 - "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God...").
    -   [Aside: Science excels at observing *how* the natural world operates *now*, but God's Word reveals the *Who*, *Why*, and *How* of its origin. We trust the Creator's testimony (cf. Ps 119:160). Ellen White notes science cannot explain life's origin (T8 258) – faith accepts God's testimony.]
    -   True understanding comes through faith in God's revealed Word (Rom 10:17).
-   **The Path to Restoration (Through Christ):**
    -   Begins with reconnecting to God through Christ, the promised Seed (John 14:6; 2 Cor 5:17-19). Accepting the gift foreshadowed in Gen 3:15.
    -   This restoration empowers healing in relationships with others (Eph 4:32; 1 John 4:11). Love replaces blame.
    -   Allows true enjoyment and responsible stewardship of God's creation again (Ps 8:6; cf. Gen 1:28; Rom 8:19-21).
    -   How does accepting Christ as Creator (John 1:3) and Redeemer (Gal 3:13) change our daily perspective? **(RQ)**
-   **Creation and Sabbath: End-Time Relevance:**
    -   Upholding the truth of Creation and the seventh-day Sabbath is central to true worship, especially in the last days (Rev 14:7; Ex 20:8-11).
    -   It acknowledges God's ultimate authority as Creator against counterfeit systems of worship (cf. Rev 14:9-11).
    -   Connects directly to the First Angel's Message (Worship the Creator - Rev 14:7) and stands in contrast to the mark of the beast (Rev 14:9).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   Recap: God's perfect creation (Gen 1-2), the tragic entry of sin and its consequences (Gen 3; Rom 6:23), the immediate promise of redemption in Christ (Gen 3:15).
-   Reiterate: Creation and the Sabbath are not just history, but foundational truths for faith, worship (Rev 14:7), and understanding God's ongoing restorative plan through Jesus.
-   The choice remains: Trust God's Word (Creator, Redeemer - Heb 11:3; John 1:1-3, 14) or the echoes of the serpent's lie (Gen 3:4)? **(RQ)**
-   **Actionable Steps:**
    1.  **Acknowledge the Creator Daily:** This week, consciously thank God for specific aspects of His creation, recognizing His power and love (based on Gen 1; Ps 19:1; Rev 14:7).
    2.  **Embrace Sabbath Rest Intentionally:** Plan this Sabbath to specifically set aside distractions and focus on relationship with God, the Creator and Redeemer (based on Gen 2:1-3; Ex 20:8-11; Mark 2:27-28).
    3.  **Trust the Redeemer's Promise:** Reflect on Gen 3:15 and Rom 6:23. Make a conscious choice to accept Christ's gift of life and forgiveness, turning from sin's deception.
-   Invitation: Choose today to worship the Creator (Rev 14:7). Embrace His Sabbath rest as a sign of loving relationship (Ex 31:13, 17). Accept the full restoration found only in Jesus Christ, the promised Seed who overcomes (Gen 3:15; 1 John 5:4-5).
-   Final Thought: Returning to the Creator through Christ is returning home.
