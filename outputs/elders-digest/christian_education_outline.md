### Introduction (6 min)

- **The Question:** What is the _true_ purpose of education? Is it just job
  preparation, or something more? **(RQ)**
- Contrast worldly view (temporal success) vs. Biblical view (eternal
  preparedness).
- Introduce concept: True education encompasses the whole being – spiritual,
  mental, physical (Gen 1:27 - image of God).
- Central Verse Introduction: Proverbs 22:6 sets the stage – foundational
  training has lasting impact.
  - [Write on board: Proverbs 22:6 - Train up a child...]
- Thesis: God's plan for education is a redemptive process, restoring His image
  and preparing us for eternity, starting in the home.

### Section 1: The Foundation - Home & Parental Duty (10 min)

- **Focus:** The home as the first school, parents as primary educators.
- **Deuteronomy 6:6-9:** God's command to Israel.
  - Verse 6: Word in the _heart_ first (parent's own relationship).
  - Verse 7: Teach _diligently_ - when? Sitting, walking, lying down, rising up
    (constant integration).
    - [Whiteboard: Deut 6:7 - DILIGENTLY (All of life)]
  - Verses 8-9: Visible reminders (hand, forehead, posts, gates) - making faith
    tangible.
  - **Practical Link:** How does this ancient command apply to busy modern
    lives? **(RQ)** Where are our 'doorposts' today?
- **Ephesians 6:4:** Fathers (parents), provoke not... but bring them up in the
  _nurture_ and _admonition_ of the Lord.
  - 'Nurture': Training by discipline, instruction.
  - 'Admonition': Warning, encouragement based on God's Word.
  - [Write on board: Eph 6:4 - Nurture (Training) + Admonition
    (Guidance/Warning) = Lord's Way]
  - This is a divine _obligation_, not an option.
- **Connecting Point:** The home environment lays the crucial groundwork. What
  happens when this foundation is weak or missing? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Curriculum - Wisdom, Scripture, Character [*] (12 min)

- **Focus:** The _content_ and _goal_ of true education.
- **Proverbs 9:10:** The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
  - Not just knowledge, but _wisdom_ (skill in godly living).
  - Foundation: Reverence and awe for God.
  - [Whiteboard: Knowledge vs. Wisdom (Prov 9:10)]
  - Worldly education often lacks this starting point. **(RQ)**
- **2 Timothy 3:14-17:** The centrality of Scripture.
  - Verse 14-15: Continue in what you learned... Holy Scriptures... make thee
    _wise unto salvation_ through faith in Christ Jesus.
    - Primary goal: Salvation, not just earthly success.
  - Verse 16-17: All scripture... profitable for doctrine, reproof, correction,
    instruction in righteousness... _thoroughly furnished_ unto all good works.
    - [Write on board: 2 Tim 3:16-17 -> Scripture equips for SALVATION & GOOD
      WORKS]
    - Holistic development: Knowing truth, correcting error, living righteously.
- **Philippians 4:8:** Guarding the avenues of the soul.
  - Focus the mind on: True, honest, just, pure, lovely, good report, virtue,
    praise.
  - This is active mental discipline, crucial for character development.
  - [Analogy (from verse): Mind like a garden - requires intentional planting
    (Phil 4:8) and weeding.]
  - How does media/entertainment challenge this biblical instruction? **(RQ)**
- **Goal:** Character transformation – reflecting the divine nature (2 Peter
  1:4).
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Our schools
    should function similarly.]

### Section 3: The Environment - Guarding Heart & Mind (10 min)

- **Focus:** The need for protected environments (home, church, school) that
  support biblical principles.
- **Revisit Proverbs 22:6:** Training in the _way he should go_ implies a
  specific, godly path, distinct from the world's ways.
- **The Challenge:** Worldly influences often contradict biblical teaching (1
  John 2:15-16).
  - Need for discernment and protection.
- **Role of the Church:** An educational center reinforcing home teaching (Heb
  10:24-25 - provoke unto love and good works, assembling together).
  - Sabbath School, Pathfinders, etc., as extensions of godly instruction.
- **Role of Christian Schools:** Provide an environment where:
  - Scripture is the foundation (linking back to 2 Tim 3:16-17).
  - Teachers model Christian character.
  - Peers can encourage godly living (Prov 13:20 - walk with wise men).
  - Protection from corrupting influences is prioritized.
  - [Whiteboard: Supportive Triangle: Home <-> Church <-> School (All pointing
    to Christ/Scripture)]
- **Parental Obligation Reinforced:** Providing _this kind_ of education
  (Bible-based, character-focused) is part of the Ephesians 6:4 command.
  - [Aside: Instead of spending primarily on fleeting trends, we can invest
    resources in education that builds eternal character. It's like choosing
    durable building materials over temporary decorations – the foundation
    matters most for the long haul.]
  - What sacrifices might be necessary to prioritize true education? **(RQ)**

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

- **Recap:** True education is God's plan for restoration.
  - Starts in the home (Deut 6, Eph 6:4).
  - Centered on Scripture and wisdom (Prov 9:10, 2 Tim 3:14-17).
  - Aims for character transformation reflecting Christ (Phil 4:8).
  - Requires intentional, guarded environments (Prov 22:6).
- **The Stakes:** Not just temporal success, but eternal destiny.
- **Challenge:** Are we, as parents, church members, individuals, fully
  embracing God's blueprint for education?
- **Appeal:**
  - To Parents: Recommit to diligent, Christ-centered training in the home.
    Prayerfully consider the educational environment for your children.
  - To Church Community: Support families and Christian educational initiatives.
    Be an educational center that upholds truth.
  - To All: Commit to lifelong learning grounded in God's Word, allowing Him to
    transform our characters for His glory and for eternity.
- Final thought: Let us invest in that which lasts forever – characters prepared
  for the kingdom of God.
