### Introduction (5 min)
- Prayer: Our vital connection to God, especially crucial in these last days.
- Often feel hesitant to ask for 'basic' needs. Is it spiritual enough? (RQ)
- Jesus, our Example, includes a direct request for physical *and* spiritual needs right in His model prayer.
- Focus: Understanding the significance of asking for daily needs as taught in Matthew 6:11, recognizing God as our sole source.
- [Write on board: Matthew 6:11 - "Give us this day our daily bread."]
- "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend." (Steps to Christ, p. 93) - This includes our daily needs.

### Section 1: Unpacking "Daily Bread" (Matt 6:11) (12 min)
- **"Give us..."**: Acknowledging the Source.
    - Not "Help us earn" or "Let us find," but "Give." A fundamental posture of faith.
    - Confesses dependence; God is the ultimate Provider (James 1:17). He sustains the universe; He can sustain us.
    - [Whiteboard: GIVE = Acknowledges God as Source (James 1:17)]
    - Communal aspect: "Us," "Our." Not just my needs, but the needs of the community/family of God, His remnant people.
    - Implies intercession and shared concern, reflecting God's character.
    - [Aside: Praying for 'our' daily bread broadens our perspective beyond personal needs; it connects us to the global family of God, reminding us that their needs are intertwined with ours, especially those of like precious faith.]
- **"...this day..."**: Acknowledging God's Timing & Sufficiency.
    - Focus on immediate, present needs. Trusting Him *today*.
    - Discourages anxious hoarding for the future (cf. Matt 6:34). God knows the trials ahead; He will provide strength for *that* day too.
    - Teaches reliance 'one day at a time'. "We need not carry tomorrow's burdens today." (Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 101)
    - [Whiteboard: THIS DAY = Focus on Present Need, Daily Trust]
    - [Concept (from Matt 6:11): Manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) - God provided exactly enough for each day, teaching daily dependence. A type of the spiritual food we need daily.]
- **"...our daily bread."**: Acknowledging God's Provision Scope.
    - "Bread" represents all necessary provisions for life – physical (food, shelter, health), mental (clarity, wisdom), and especially spiritual (His Word, His presence).
    - Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35). We need Him daily.
    - Not luxuries, but necessities for life and godliness.
    - Fosters contentment with what God provides (cf. 1 Tim 6:8).
    - [Whiteboard: DAILY BREAD = All Necessary Provision (Physical/Spiritual - John 6:35)]
    - How does asking for *needs* (including spiritual strength) differ from asking for *wants*? (RQ)

### Section 2: Asking as Worship & Trust [*] (13 min)
- **Asking Acknowledges God's Character:**
    - Recognizes His Power: He *can* provide (Creator & Sustainer).
    - Recognizes His Promises: He *has said* He will provide for His faithful children (Psalm 37:25). His Word is sure.
    - Recognizes His Personality: He is a generous Father who *delights* to give good gifts (Matt 7:9-11). His law is love, and His giving reflects that love.
    - [Write on board: Asking = Worship (Acknowledges God's Character: Power, Promises, Fatherhood - Matt 7:11)]
    - Read Matthew 7:7-11. How does Jesus illustrate the Father's desire to give? (RQ) His willingness exceeds even the best earthly parent.
    - [Analogy (from Matt 7:11): A loving human parent delights in providing for their child's needs; how much more our perfect Heavenly Father, who gave His Son for us?]
- **Asking Expresses Total Dependence:**
    - Confesses our inability to provide for ourselves ultimately, especially spiritual life.
    - Counters pride and self-sufficiency, which are contrary to the spirit of Christ.
    - [Aside: In our culture of self-reliance, admitting daily need feels counter-intuitive, yet it's the very posture God invites us into through this prayer (Matt 6:11). It reflects the humility needed to receive His grace.]
    - It's an act of faith, trusting His care over our own efforts. "Faith takes God at His word, not asking to understand the meaning of the trying experiences that come." (Prophets and Kings, p. 528)
- **Asking Fosters Confidence & Peace:**
    - Obedience to the command: "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer... let your requests be made known to God" (Phil 4:6). This is God's prescribed remedy for anxiety.
    - The result? "...the peace of God... will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus" (Phil 4:7). A peace the world cannot give, vital for navigating end-time pressures.
    - [Write on board: Phil 4:6-7 -> Ask -> Peace (Guard)]
    - God *wants* us to ask, relieving our burden: "Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" (Luke 12:32). The Kingdom includes His daily care.
    - How does actively asking for needs combat worry and prepare us for future challenges? (RQ)

### Section 3: Practical Implications of Dependent Prayer (10 min)
- **The Need/Question (from life & text):** We all have daily needs (physical, emotional, spiritual). In a world filled with uncertainty, how do we approach God regarding them? Do we truly trust Him implicitly as our Father? (Matt 6:11, Phil 4:6)
- **The Biblical Principle/Solution (from text):** God invites and commands us to bring *all* our daily needs (physical sustenance, spiritual strength from the Bread of Life) to Him in dependent, trusting prayer, acknowledging Him as our loving Father and all-sufficient Provider (Matt 6:11, Matt 7:7-11, Phil 4:6, John 6:35).
    - [Whiteboard: Principle: Ask Daily (Physical/Spiritual), Trust Fully (Matt 6:11, 7:11, John 6:35)]
- **Bridging to Practice (linking text):** Living out Matt 6:11 means consciously shifting from self-reliance or worry (Matt 6:25-34) to active, daily requests offered in faith (Phil 4:6). It means seeking first the Kingdom and His righteousness, trusting all these things will be added.
- **Actionable Steps (derived from passages):**
    1.  **Daily Inventory & Request:** Start each day consciously listing needs (yours and others') – physical and spiritual – and presenting them to God based on Matt 6:11 & John 6:35. Ask for wisdom and strength for the day's duties.
    2.  **Combat Worry with Prayer:** When anxiety about provision (physical or spiritual) arises, immediately turn it into a specific request, claiming God's promises (Phil 4:6-7). Replace worry with worshipful asking.
    3.  **Cultivate Contentment & Gratitude:** Thank God specifically for the 'daily bread' He provides (physical blessings, His Word, His presence), resisting comparison or desire for excess (1 Tim 6:8 perspective applied to Matt 6:11).
    4.  **Pray Corporately:** Intentionally pray for the 'daily bread' (physical and spiritual needs) of fellow believers, church leaders, and those in need globally (reflecting the 'us'/'our' of Matt 6:11).

    - [Whiteboard: Actions: 1. Daily Ask (Phys/Spir) 2. Pray vs Worry (Phil 4:6) 3. Thank/Contentment 4. Pray for 'Us']

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)
- Recap: Praying "Give us this day our daily bread" (Matt 6:11) is not mundane; it's profound worship and essential for spiritual survival.
- It acknowledges our total dependence, God's Fatherhood, and His faithful promises (Matt 7:11, Phil 4:6-7). It reminds us to seek the Bread of Life daily (John 6:35).
- It builds trust, fosters contentment, brings peace, and unites us as God's waiting people.
- "We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history." (Life Sketches, p. 196) - Part of that teaching is daily dependence through prayer.
- Invitation: Will you embrace the simplicity and power of asking? Will you trust your Father daily for *all* your needs – physical and spiritual – bringing every request to Him in childlike faith, readying your heart for whatever He has planned? (Matt 7:7)
- Final Prayer: Focus on trusting God for daily needs (physical and spiritual), for ourselves and the church family, asking for the Bread of Life above all.
