### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Briefly introduce Ecclesiastes: The Preacher's (Solomon's) search for meaning 'under the sun'.
- Today's focus: Chapters 5 & 6 - Practical wisdom on two key areas: How we approach God (worship) and how we view possessions (wealth).
- The Preacher observes life, contrasts fleeting pursuits with enduring principles.
- **(RQ)** How relevant are these ancient observations today in our fast-paced, often materialistic world?
- [Whiteboard: Title - Worship That Pleases & Wealth That Perishes (Eccl 5-6)]

### Section 1: Approaching God: The Right Way (Eccl 5:1-7) (12 min)
- **The Call to Reverence (Eccl 5:1a):** "Keep thy foot" - Walk prudently, thoughtfully, intentionally into God's presence.
    - Contrast with casual, unprepared approaches.
    - **(RQ)** What does 'keeping our foot' look like practically when we gather for worship or personal devotion?
    - [Whiteboard: Eccl 5:1a -> Prudence, Reverence]
- **Hearing over Empty Ritual (Eccl 5:1b):** "Be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools."
    - Hearing = Listening to God's Word, seeking His will, internalizing truth.
    - Sacrifice of fools = Outward forms without heart obedience; meaningless ritual (cf. 1 Sam 15:22; Matt 15:7-9).
    - **(RQ)** Are we coming to church/study primarily to 'hear' from God or just to 'do' the routine?
    - [Whiteboard: Hear (Obedience) > Sacrifice of Fools (Empty Ritual)]
- **Careful Words (Eccl 5:2-3):** Avoid rash speech and empty multiplication of words before God. Quality over quantity.
    - Connects to reverence and understanding Who we are addressing.
- **Integrity in Vows (Eccl 5:4-7):** Take vows seriously; better not to vow than to vow and not pay. Fear God.
    - God values integrity and faithfulness.
    - [Whiteboard: Eccl 5:4-5 -> Vows = Integrity before God]
    - **Practical Application:** Approach worship with preparation, focus on listening/learning, speak thoughtfully, be faithful in commitments made to God.

### Section 2: Wealth, Worry, and Wisdom (Eccl 5:8-17) [*] (12 min)
- **Observing Injustice (Eccl 5:8-9):** The reality of oppression and bureaucracy.
    - Counsel: Don't be dismayed; trust in God's higher oversight ("higher than they"). He sees and will bring justice.
    - [Whiteboard: Eccl 5:8 -> God's Oversight > Human Injustice]
    - **(RQ)** How does knowing God ultimately judges help us respond to injustice we see or experience?
- **The Trap of Loving Money (Eccl 5:10-12):**
    - "He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver..." (v. 10) - Money cannot satisfy the soul's deepest needs.
    - More wealth often brings more dependents/worries (v. 11), less peace (v. 12).
    - [Whiteboard: Eccl 5:10 -> Love of Money ≠ Satisfaction]
    - [Analogy (from verse 10): Trying to quench thirst with saltwater - the more you drink, the thirstier you get.]
- **The Harm and Loss of Riches (Eccl 5:13-17):**
    - Riches kept to the owner's hurt (pride, anxiety, spiritual neglect).
    - Riches perish by "evil travail" (bad investments, misfortune) - leaving nothing for the next generation.
    - The wealthy can die just as naked and empty-handed as they came (v. 15).
    - Life spent in darkness, sorrow, and wrath chasing wealth (v. 17).
    - **(RQ)** How does this perspective challenge modern society's relentless pursuit of wealth?

### Section 3: God's Gift vs. Empty Gain (Eccl 5:18-20; 6:1-12) (10 min)
- **The Balanced View: Enjoying God's Gifts (Eccl 5:18-20):**
    - It is good and fitting to eat, drink, and enjoy the fruit of one's labor.
    - This ability to enjoy is a *gift from God* (v. 19).
    - God gives contentment in the present task, distracting from life's brevity (v. 20).
    - [Whiteboard: Eccl 5:19 -> Enjoyment = Gift of God]
    - [Aside: True stewardship isn't asceticism, but gratefully using God's blessings for His glory and our good, without letting them become idols. It's finding joy *in* His provision, not *apart* from Him.]
- **The Tragedy of Ungranted Enjoyment (Eccl 6:1-6):**
    - A common evil: Having wealth and honor but lacking the God-given ability/circumstances to enjoy it.
    - Even long life and many children are meaningless without soul satisfaction (v. 3, 6).
    - **(RQ)** What prevents people, even believers, from truly enjoying the blessings God gives?
- **The Limits of Materialism (Eccl 6:7-12):**
    - All labor is for the mouth (basic needs), yet the soul (appetite/desire) is not filled (v. 7).
    - Riches don't answer life's ultimate questions or satisfy deep longings (v. 8-9).
    - We don't know what is truly good for us in this fleeting life, nor what comes after (v. 11-12) - *apart from God's revelation*. 
    - [Whiteboard: Eccl 6:7 -> Labor for Mouth ≠ Soul Satisfaction]

### Conclusion: Beyond Vanity: Finding True Satisfaction in Christ (6 min)
- Recap: Ecclesiastes highlights the vanity of improper worship and the pursuit of wealth as ultimate goals.
    - Reverent hearing > Empty ritual.
    - Contentment in God's gifts > Unsatisfying pursuit of riches.
- The Preacher's search points beyond 'under the sun' realities.
- **The Ultimate Answer:** Where Ecclesiastes shows the *limits* of earthly things, the Gospel reveals the *source* of true satisfaction.
    - Riches cannot satisfy the soul (Eccl 6:7), but Jesus is the Bread of Life (John 6:35).
    - Earthly wisdom falls short (Eccl 6:12), but Christ is the Wisdom of God (1 Cor 1:24).
    - Ecclesiastes points to the darkness of life without God's full revelation; the New Testament points to Jesus, the Word made flesh (John 1:1, 14), who brought life and immortality to light through the gospel (2 Tim 1:10).
    - [Whiteboard: Ecclesiastes' Questions -> Christ, The Word (John 1:1), The Answer (2 Tim 1:10)]
- **Appeal:** Seek true riches - a right relationship with God through Christ. Approach Him with reverence, listen to His Word, find contentment in His provision, and store up treasure in heaven (Matt 6:19-21).
- Final Prayer.
