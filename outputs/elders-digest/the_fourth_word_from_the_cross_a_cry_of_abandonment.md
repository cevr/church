### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome and Prayer.
- Context: The Cross, final hours, the seven sayings.
- Introduce the Fourth Word: The most agonizing cry (Matthew 27:46).
  - [Write on board: Central Verse: Matt 27:46 - "My God, My God..."]
- Theme: Exploring the depth of Christ's suffering as our substitute, His
  unwavering faith, and the assurance it brings us.
- Why is this cry so central to understanding the atonement? **(RQ)** What does
  His feeling of forsakenness mean for _our_ relationship with God?

### Section 1: The Cry and the Darkness (8 min)

- **The Setting:**
  - Physical agony: Crucifixion's torment (briefly describe).
  - Mental/Spiritual Agony: Culminating point.
  - Supernatural Darkness (Matt 27:45): Three hours. Symbolizing God's face
    hidden as Christ bore sin.
    - [Write on board: Darkness (Matt 27:45) = God's Face Hidden (Sin's
      Consequence)]
- **The Cry Itself:**
  - Aramaic quote (Mark 15:34), linking directly to the prophetic lament of
    Psalm 22:1.
  - This wasn't just physical pain; it was the spiritual agony of separation
    from the Father – the ultimate consequence of sin.
  - [Write on board: Separation from God = True Death/Wages of Sin (Rom 6:23)]
  - How does this darkness contrast with God being light (1 John 1:5)? **(RQ)**
    What does it signify about the nature of sin?

### Section 2: Substitution and the Weight of Sin [*] (10 min)

- **Bearing Our Sin:**
  - Christ as our Substitute: He took _our_ place, experiencing _our_ deserved
    separation.
    - Isaiah 53:4-6: "Surely he hath borne our griefs... the Lord hath laid on
      him the iniquity of us all." [Read passage]
    - 2 Corinthians 5:21: "For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no
      sin..." [Read verse]
    - [Write on board: Diagram: Humanity -> Sin -> Separation | Christ
      (Substitute) -> Bears Sin -> Atonement]
- **The Father's Wrath Against Sin:**
  - The feeling of separation was the experience of God's judicial withdrawal
    due to the sin He bore (Isaiah 53:10a - "Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise
    him; he hath put him to grief").
  - It wasn't personal rejection of the Son's character, but the necessary
    consequence of sin being laid upon Him.
  - EGW Insight: This experience "broke the heart of the Son of God" (DA 753).
    - [Note: Explain 'wrath' as God's settled, righteous opposition to sin, not
      arbitrary human anger].
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our lives should represent the kingdom
    of heaven, purchased at infinite cost, not reflecting the world's ways which
    necessitated Christ's separation.]
- What does it mean that Christ was 'made sin' for us (2 Cor 5:21)? How deep was
  that identification? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: Faith Amidst the Feeling of Forsakenness (10 min)

- **Unwavering Trust:**
  - Despite the _feeling_ of abandonment, the cry begins "My God, My God" (Matt
    27:46).
    - This demonstrates retained relationship and trust even in the deepest
      darkness. Faith clinging on despite feeling.
    - [Write on board: Feeling = Forsaken | Faith = "MY God"]
  - Contrast with despair: It's a question born of agony (Psalm 22:1), not a
    statement of lost faith or rebellion.
- **Victory Through Faith and Submission:**
  - Christ learned obedience through suffering (Hebrews 5:7-8 - "though he were
    a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered").
  - His victory wasn't in avoiding the cup, but drinking it in faith, trusting
    the Father's ultimate purpose even when He couldn't feel His presence.
  - EGW Insight: Christ gained the victory through faith during this ultimate
    trial (DA 756).
  - [Brief Illustration Concept (from Heb 5:7): Like an athlete pushing through
    extreme pain, trusting the training (God's will) will lead to victory, even
    when every muscle screams to stop.]
- How does Christ's example challenge us when our feelings contradict God's
  promises (e.g., feeling alone despite Heb 13:5)? **(RQ)**

### Section 4: Our Assurance and Response (7 min)

- **Need/Question:** If Christ felt forsaken while bearing our sin, does that
  mean _we_ might be forsaken by God when we sin or suffer?
- **Biblical Principle: Never Forsaken in Christ:**
  - Because Christ endured _our_ deserved separation, believers who trust Him
    will _never_ be ultimately forsaken by the Father. His experience guarantees
    ours.
  - Romans 8:38-39: "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life... nor any
    other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is
    _in Christ Jesus_ our Lord." [Read verses]
    - [Write on board: His Separation (Matt 27:46) -> Our Eternal Security (Rom
      8:38-39)]
- **Bridging & Motivation for Holiness:**
  - Understanding the depth of His suffering _for our specific sins_ should
    cultivate a hatred for sin, not a license to sin.
  - It deepens love, gratitude, and commitment to Him who paid such a price.
  - [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves... consider how understanding the
    cross redirects our resources. Like finding a coin, even worldly means can
    be consecrated to share the truth of His sacrifice, especially during times
    like December when hearts may be more open.]
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from His Sacrifice & Our Security):**
  1.  **Reflect:** Daily recall the cost of sin seen at the cross (Gal 2:20).
  2.  **Trust:** When facing trials or feelings of distance, cling to God's
      promises based on Christ's faithfulness, not your feelings (Heb 13:5b).
  3.  **Obey:** Respond to His immense love with willing obedience out of
      gratitude (John 14:15).

### Conclusion (5 min)

- Recap: The fourth word (Matt 27:46) reveals the horrific cost of sin
  (separation), Christ's role as our substitute (Isa 53, 2 Cor 5:21), His
  unwavering faith even in darkness (Heb 5:8), and the victory won for us.
- The depth of His suffering is the measure of His love and the absolute
  foundation of our hope and security (Rom 8:38-39).
- Because He cried out in abandonment _for us_, we can cry out in assurance,
  "Abba, Father" (Romans 8:15), knowing we are accepted in the Beloved (Eph
  1:6).
- Invitation: Will you allow the reality of Christ's sacrifice – His
  forsakenness for you – to transform your view of sin and deepen your
  commitment to Him this week?
- Final Prayer.
