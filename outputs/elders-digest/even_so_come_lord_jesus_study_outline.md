### Introduction (5 min)
-   Welcome & Prayer
-   The constant refrain of Scripture's close: Jesus is coming soon (Rev 22:7, 12, 20).
-   Not just a doctrine, but a living hope that shapes today (1 John 3:3).
-   Read Central Verse: Revelation 22:20. The dual response: His promise ("Surely I come quickly"), our plea ("Even so, come, Lord Jesus").
-   Purpose: To explore the biblical call to readiness (Matt 24:44) for Christ's imminent return (Rev 22:7, 12, 20), focusing on present preparation through hope (1 John 3:3) and faithfulness (Matt 24:45-46).

### Section 1: The Certain Promise - "I Come Quickly" (10 min)
-   **The Certainty:** Jesus *Himself* testifies to His return.
    -   Read Revelation 22:7, 12, 20. Emphasize the repetition: "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly."
    -   [Whiteboard: "SURELY I COME QUICKLY" (Rev 22:7, 12, 20)]
    -   This isn't speculation; it's divine testimony, the "testimony of Jesus" (Rev 19:10b).
-   **The Imminence:** "Quickly" implies nearness and suddenness when it happens.
    -   Not necessarily immediate in *our* timeframe, but the next great event, always 'at the doors' (cf. Matt 24:33). The urgency is clear from the context of Revelation's final warnings and blessings (Rev 22:11-19).
    -   (RQ) How does the *certainty* ("Surely") and *imminence* ("quickly") declared by Jesus Himself (Rev 22:7, 12, 20) affect how we view our daily lives?
-   **The Authority:** Grounded in God's revealed Word.
    -   This promise comes directly from "He which testifieth these things" (Rev 22:20), whose word is faithful and true (Rev 21:5).

### Section 2: The Unknown Hour, The Known Duty (10 min)
-   **Warning Against Date-Setting:**
    -   Read Matthew 24:36. Clarity: "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only."
    -   [Whiteboard: Matt 24:36 - NO MAN KNOWS THE DAY/HOUR]
    -   The implication *from* Matt 24:36: Since the *when* is unknown, our focus must shift from timing to readiness. (EGW, Evangelism, p. 221 reinforces this biblical principle).
    -   (RQ) Based on Jesus' own words in Matt 24:36, why is focusing on specific dates dangerous or distracting from the real preparation needed?
-   **The Command: Be Ready NOW:**
    -   Read Matthew 24:44. "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh."
    -   [Whiteboard: Matt 24:44 - "BE YE ALSO READY"]
    -   Emphasis derived directly from the imperative "Be ye also ready" (Matt 24:44): Readiness is a present state, not a future action.
    -   [Analogy (from Matt 24:43-44): Like a homeowner expecting a thief - constant vigilance is required because the hour is unknown, not last-minute panic.]
    -   This state of readiness implies a constant connection with Christ, being found faithful when He comes (cf. Matt 24:45-46).

### Section 3: Hope That Purifies [*] (10 min)
-   **The Connection: Hope and Holiness:**
    -   Read 1 John 3:3. "And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure."
    -   [Whiteboard: HOPE (1 John 3:3) -> PURIFICATION]
    -   The direct link in 1 John 3:3: The genuine hope ("this hope") of seeing Jesus as He is (v. 2) motivates present transformation ("purifieth himself").
    -   (RQ) According to 1 John 3:3, what is the practical result of truly hoping for Christ's return? What might 'purifying oneself' involve, guided by other scriptures (e.g., Phil 4:8, James 1:27, 1 Pet 1:22)?
-   **The Standard: Christ's Purity:**
    -   The goal is derived from the text: "...purifieth himself, *even as he is pure*" (1 John 3:3). Reflecting Christ's character is the aim (cf. Eph 4:13).
    -   This purification isn't self-achieved righteousness, but stems from His purity ("even as *He* is pure," 1 John 3:3) and relies on His justifying power (Rom 3:26). It's Christ's righteousness imputed *and* imparted through surrender.
    -   [Whiteboard: Character Goal = "As He is Pure" (1 John 3:3)]
-   **Caution Against Presumption:**
    -   The ongoing action "purifieth himself" (1 John 3:3) implies a process, not a self-declared finished state. Assurance comes from abiding in Christ (John 15:4-5), not self-assessment. (EGW, Selected Messages, Bk 1, p. 314 aligns with this need for humility).
    -   Our focus, stemming from the call to "be ready" (Matt 24:44) and "purify" (1 John 3:3), is trusting and obeying *today*.

### Section 4: Our Present Work - Witness & Faithfulness (5 min)
-   **The Call to Witness:**
    -   Readiness involves sharing the reason for our hope (1 Peter 3:15). This aligns with the prerequisite for the end: "this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come" (Matt 24:14).
    -   We testify to what we know of Christ personally (cf. 1 John 1:1-3).
    -   Focus on the core message: The Everlasting Gospel (Rev 14:6-7), centered on God being both "just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus" (Rom 3:26).
    -   [Whiteboard: Gospel = God is JUST + JUSTIFIER (Rom 3:26)]
    -   Share this truth unadulterated (EGW, Evangelism, p. 702).
-   **Faithfulness in Duty:**
    -   Readiness is demonstrated by faithfulness in present duties, as illustrated by the parable of the faithful and wise servant immediately following the call to be ready (Matt 24:45-46).
    -   [Aside: Our daily choices, our interactions, our faithfulness in small things â€“ these are the threads weaving the fabric of readiness (Matt 24:45-46). It's like building a seawall stone by stone; each act of obedience prompted by hope (1 John 3:3) strengthens our defense against the final storm.]
-   **Hastening the Day:**
    -   Our collective character development ("purifieth himself," 1 John 3:3) and witness (Matt 24:14) are linked to God's timing. (EGW, Desire of Ages, pp. 633-634 explains this connection).
    -   (RQ) Reflecting on DA 633-634, how can our church community better reflect Christ's character (1 John 3:3) and fulfill the gospel commission (Matt 24:14) to hasten His return?

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
-   **Summary:**
    -   Christ's return is certain and soon, based on His own testimony (Rev 22:7, 12, 20).
    -   The hour is unknown, demanding present readiness (Matt 24:36, 44).
    -   True hope in His coming leads to active purification, aiming for His standard (1 John 3:3).
    -   Our present work involves faithful witness (Matt 24:14; Rom 3:26) and diligent service (Matt 24:45-46).
-   **The Final Plea:**
    -   Re-read Revelation 22:20. "Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
    -   Is this the genuine desire of our hearts, evidenced by our lives?
-   **Invitation & Action Steps:**
    -   Let's respond practically to God's Word today:
        1.  **Purify Your Focus (1 John 3:3):** Identify one specific area (e.g., thought life, media consumption, conversation topic) this week where you will consciously apply Philippians 4:8 ("whatsoever things are pure...") as part of your personal 'purification' prompted by the hope of His coming.
        2.  **Practice Faithful Readiness (Matt 24:44-46):** Choose one daily duty or responsibility (at home, work, or church) and consciously perform it this week "as unto the Lord," reflecting the readiness of the faithful servant awaiting His master.
        3.  **Share Your Hope (Rev 22:20; Rom 3:26):** Pray for an opportunity, and then share either the core truth of Jesus' justifying power (Rom 3:26) or your personal hope in His soon return (Rev 22:20) with one person this week.
    -   Let our lives echo the prayer: "Even so, come, Lord Jesus."
