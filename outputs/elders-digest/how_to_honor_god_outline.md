### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Prayer
- Introduce Topic: Honoring God - more than words, it's a practical reality.
- Central Question: What does it _practically_ mean to honor God, especially in
  areas often considered 'ours'? **(RQ)**
- Read Central Verse: Proverbs 3:9 - Set the stage for the core instruction.
- Brief Overview: We'll explore _why_ we honor God and _how_ Proverbs 3:9 guides
  us, supported by other scriptures.

### Why We Honor God (8 min) [*]

- **Foundation:** Our duty to honor God stems from Who He is and what He has
  done.
  - **Creator:** (Gen 1:1, Rev 4:11) - He owns everything, including us.
    Honoring Him acknowledges His ownership.
    `[Whiteboard: HONOR GOD AS: Creator (Rev 4:11)]`
  - **Preserver/Provider:** (Acts 17:28, Matt 6:26) - He sustains our lives and
    provides all necessities. Honoring Him expresses gratitude and dependence.
    `[Whiteboard: Preserver/Provider (Acts 17:28)]`
  - **Redeemer:** (Eph 1:7, 1 Pet 1:18-19) - He bought us back from sin with
    Christ's blood. Honoring Him acknowledges the infinite price paid.
    `[Whiteboard: Redeemer (Eph 1:7)]`
  - **Source of Hope:** (Titus 2:13, 1 Pet 1:3) - He gives us the promise of
    eternal life. Honoring Him reflects our hope and allegiance to His kingdom.
    `[Whiteboard: Source of Hope (Titus 2:13)]`
- Transition: Knowing _why_ provides the motivation. Now, _how_ do we do it
  practically, as Proverbs instructs?

### How We Honor God: Substance & Firstfruits (15 min)

- **Focus on Proverbs 3:9:** "Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the
  firstfruits of all thine increase:"
  - **"With thy substance"**: What does 'substance' mean? (Wealth, resources,
    income derived from labor/increase).
    `[Whiteboard: Substance = Resources/Income (Prov 3:9)]`
    - Connects to God as Provider - we honor Him with what He first gave us.
    - Not just money, but the _yield_ of our efforts under His blessing.
  - **"With the firstfruits"**: The crucial qualifier. What does 'firstfruits'
    imply? **(RQ)**
    - Biblical context: Offering the _first and best_ part of the harvest
      _before_ personal use (Lev 23:10).
      `[Whiteboard: Firstfruits = First & Best Portion (Lev 23:10)]`
    - Principle: God's portion is set aside _first_, acknowledging His priority.
    - **Supporting Principle:** 1 Corinthians 16:2 - Systematic, planned giving
      ("lay by him in store") on the first day implies setting aside _first_.
    - **Supporting Principle:** Malachi 3:8-10 - Bringing the _whole_ tithe
      (God's designated portion) into the storehouse. The question "Will a man
      rob God?" implies this portion belongs to Him _first_.
    - `[Aside: It's like paying the mortgage on a house God owns before spending on decorations. Acknowledging ownership through the first payment secures our place as stewards, not owners.]`
  - **Practical Application:** How does this look today with wages/income?
    **(RQ)** Setting aside God's portion (tithe) _before_ paying bills or
    spending.
    `[Whiteboard: Action: Set aside God's portion FIRST (Prov 3:9, Mal 3:10)]`
  - [Analogy (from Prov 3:9): Like presenting the first slice of cake to the
    guest of honor before anyone else takes a piece.]

### The Role of Faith & Priority (10 min)

- **Honoring Requires Faith:** Why is setting aside firstfruits an act of faith?
  **(RQ)**
  - Hebrews 11:6 - "But without faith it is impossible to please him..."
  - Trusting God will provide for _our_ needs after giving His portion first.
    `[Whiteboard: Faith (Heb 11:6) -> Trust God's Provision]`
  - Overcoming fear of lack.
- **Honoring Requires Priority:**
  - Matthew 6:33 - "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
    and all these things shall be added unto you."
  - Putting God's kingdom first in our finances demonstrates where our true
    treasure lies (Matt 6:21).
    `[Whiteboard: Priority (Matt 6:33) -> Kingdom First]`
  - This isn't earning salvation, but a response of love and trust to the One
    who provides all.
- **God's Promise:**
  - Proverbs 3:10 - "So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
    shall burst out with new wine."
    - Context: Agrarian society promise. Principle: God blesses faithfulness.
    - Blessings may be temporal or spiritual, but God _will_ honor His word.
  - Malachi 3:10 - "...prove me now herewith... if I will not open you the
    windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing..."
  - Hebrews 10:23 - "...for he is faithful that promised." Our confidence is in
    God's character, not just the potential blessing.
    `[Whiteboard: God's Faithfulness (Heb 10:23) -> Certainty of His Promises]`
  - `[Aside: Just as early Adventists sacrificed scarce means to build institutions based on faith in God's promises, our 'firstfruits' giving today builds His kingdom and demonstrates that same reliance on His faithfulness.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)

- **Summary:** Honoring God is our duty and privilege, rooted in His character
  (Creator, Redeemer). Proverbs 3:9 gives a clear command: Honor Him with our
  substance, specifically the _firstfruits_, demonstrating faith (Heb 11:6) and
  prioritizing His kingdom (Matt 6:33).
- **Simplicity:** The command is simple: God first. The challenge is often our
  faith, not the complexity of the instruction. Have we complicated what God
  made plain? **(RQ)**
- **The Need:** Acknowledging God's ownership and Lordship over _all_ areas of
  life, including finances.
- **The Principle:** Firstfruits giving is an act of worship and trust.
- **Action Step:** This week, consciously apply the 'firstfruits' principle.
  Before anything else, set aside God's portion from your increase.
  `[Whiteboard: Challenge: Apply Firstfruits This Week (Prov 3:9)]`
- **Invitation:** Invite listeners to commit to honoring God in this tangible
  way, trusting His faithfulness (Heb 10:23).
- Final Prayer: Ask for faith to obey and experience the joy of honoring God
  first.
