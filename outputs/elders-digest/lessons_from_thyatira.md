### Introduction (5 min)

- Overview: The Seven Churches of Revelation - Messages for all time.
- Context: Thyatira - A working-class city known for trade guilds (potential
  source of compromise).
- Theme: The vital importance of doctrinal purity and resisting subtle
  compromise, even amidst commendable works.
- Central Question: How do we balance active service with unwavering
  faithfulness to God's truth? **(RQ)**
- [Whiteboard: Map showing Thyatira among the Seven Churches. Write Theme:
  Faithfulness vs. Compromise]

### Section 1: The Searching Savior (8 min)

- **Christ's Self-Identification (Rev 2:18):**
  - "Son of God": Emphasizes His divine authority and power. (Cf. Psalm 2:7)
  - "Eyes like unto a flame of fire": Penetrating insight, omniscience,
    searching judgment. Nothing hidden. (Cf. Rev 1:14)
  - "Feet are like fine brass": Stability, strength, judgment trampling
    opposition. (Cf. Rev 1:15)
- **Implication:** Christ sees beyond outward appearances, directly into the
  heart and motives of the church. [Whiteboard: Rev 2:18 - Son of God
  (Authority), Eyes of Fire (Omniscience), Feet of Brass (Judgment)]
- **(RQ)** How does knowing Christ sees everything impact how we view our church
  community and personal lives?

### Section 2: Commendable Growth (7 min)

- **Acknowledging the Good (Rev 2:19):**
  - "I know thy works, and charity [love], and service, and faith, and thy
    patience, and thy works..."
  - Note the repetition of "works" - indicating activity and effort.
  - Specific virtues commended: Love (agape), Service (diakonia), Faith
    (pistis), Patience/Perseverance (hypomone).
  - "...and the last to be more than the first." - Evidence of genuine growth
    and progress.
- **Principle:** God recognizes and values genuine growth in Christian character
  and service. [Whiteboard: List Commendable Traits (Rev 2:19) - Works, Love,
  Service, Faith, Patience, GROWTH]
- **(RQ)** Is our spiritual trajectory one of growth, with our 'last works'
  being more than our first?

### Section 3: The Danger Within [*] (12 min)

- **The Core Problem: Toleration of Error (Rev 2:20):**
  - "Thou sufferest [tolerate] that woman Jezebel..." - Likely a symbolic name
    referencing the wicked OT queen (1 Kings 16, 21), representing a specific
    influential figure or faction promoting false teaching.
  - Nature of the False Teaching: Calls herself a prophetess, teaches seduction
    to spiritual/physical immorality and idolatry (eating things sacrificed to
    idols - likely linked to trade guild feasts).
  - Subtlety: Presented under a guise of spirituality, perhaps 'deeper
    knowledge'.
- **God's Patience and Judgment (Rev 2:21-23):**
  - "I gave her space [time] to repent... and she repented not." God's
    longsuffering has limits. (Cf. 2 Peter 3:9)
  - Consequences of Refusal: Judgment upon the false teacher ('bed of sickness')
    and those committing adultery with her (spiritual/physical). Great
    tribulation.
  - God's Scrutiny: "I am he which searcheth the reins [minds] and hearts."
    Connects to Investigative Judgment principle – God assesses the true state
    of the heart. [Whiteboard: Jezebel Problem (Rev 2:20) -> False
    Teaching/Immorality -> TOLERANCE -> Judgment (Rev 2:21-23)]
  - Divine Justice: "I will give unto every one of you according to your works."
    Works reveal the true state of the heart/faith. (Cf. Matt 16:27, Rom 2:6)
- **Practical Bridge:** Tolerating known sin/error within the church, even for
  'unity' or 'peace', is dangerous and displeasing to God. [Whiteboard: God
  Searches Hearts & Minds (Rev 2:23) -> Judgment by Works]
- **(RQ)** Where might we subtly tolerate 'Jezebel' teachings or influences
  today (e.g., compromising biblical standards for cultural acceptance)?
- [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our church communities should represent
  the kingdom of heaven, not adopt the customs of the surrounding culture,
  especially when those customs contradict God's Word.]

### Section 4: The Call to Hold Fast (8 min)

- **Message to the Faithful Remnant (Rev 2:24-25):**
  - Addressed to those who "have not this doctrine" and haven't known the
    "depths of Satan" (mocking the false teacher's claim of 'deep secrets').
  - Simple Command: "I will put upon you none other burden. But that which ye
    have already hold fast till I come." No new complex requirements, just
    faithfulness to the established truth.
  - [Whiteboard: Command: HOLD FAST (Rev 2:25) to Truth Already Received]
  - [Analogy (from Rev 2:25): Holding fast is like gripping a lifeline in a
    storm – requires conscious effort and refusal to let go.]
- **Promise to the Overcomer (Rev 2:26-28):**
  - Condition: "He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end..."
  - Reward 1: "To him will I give power [authority] over the nations." Sharing
    in Christ's righteous reign. (Cf. Rev 20:4, Psalm 2:8-9)
  - Reward 2: "I will give him the morning star." Symbolizes Christ Himself,
    hope, and the dawn of eternal day. (Cf. Rev 22:16, 2 Peter 1:19)
- **Application:** True spiritual depth is found in faithfulness to God's
  revealed Word, not in esoteric or compromising teachings. Overcoming involves
  actively resisting error and persevering in obedience.
- **(RQ)** What specific truths revealed in Scripture do we need to consciously
  'hold fast' to in our current environment?

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** Thyatira reminds us that commendable works are insufficient if
  compromised by doctrinal impurity and tolerance of sin. Christ demands
  faithfulness.
- **Heeding the Spirit (Rev 2:29):** "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the
  Spirit saith unto the churches." A personal call to listen and obey.
- **The Simplicity:** The core message isn't complex - know Christ, reject
  error, hold fast to His Word, persevere in obedience born of faith.
- **Gospel Invitation:** Christ, the searching Savior, is also the forgiving
  Savior. He offers cleansing from all compromise and sin (1 John 1:9). He gives
  power to overcome.
- **Final Appeal:** Choose today to examine your heart and allegiances. Reject
  any 'Jezebel' influence. Commit to 'holding fast' to Jesus and His unchanging
  truth until He comes. Will you heed His call?
