### Introduction (5 min)

- Define Spiritual Purity: More than just outward actions; alignment of heart,
  mind, and life with God's will (Matt 5:8). It's about reflecting God's
  character.
- Introduce Genesis 34: A sobering case study in the consequences of spiritual
  compromise and incomplete obedience. Not a pleasant story, but a vital lesson.
- Central Theme: Maintaining purity requires intentional separation from worldly
  influences (2 Cor 6:17) and full obedience to God, prompted by love, not just
  fear.
- **(RQ)** In our hyper-connected world, how vital is understanding _biblical_
  separation, not isolation, but insulation from sin?
- `[Write on board: Spiritual Purity = Alignment with God (Matt 5:8) ≠ Worldly Conformity (Rom 12:2)]`

### Section 1: The Danger Zone - Lingering Near Temptation (10 min)

- **The Setting:** Jacob settles _near_ Shechem (Gen 33:18-19), not fully
  separated as perhaps implied by God's previous guidance (cf. Gen 31:3, 32:9).
  He bought land there, suggesting permanence.
  - A seemingly small compromise – convenience or perceived safety over complete
    obedience? (Gen 33:17 hints at delaying going to Bethel).
  - `[Write on board: Proximity ≠ Purity]`
- **The Incident:** Dinah "went out to see the daughters of the land" (Gen
  34:1). Curiosity and unguarded association.
  - She placed herself in an environment incompatible with God's standards.
  - **(RQ)** What seemingly 'innocent' associations today might place us or our
    families in spiritual danger zones?
- **The Consequence:** Defilement and violation by Shechem, son of the local
  ruler (Gen 34:2). Sin often has devastating ripple effects.
  - This wasn't just about Dinah; it impacted the entire family and their
    witness.
- **Illustration:** Like setting up a tent near a known wildfire zone. Even if
  you don't intend to get burned, the proximity itself creates unnecessary risk.
  Lingering near temptation invites trouble.

### Section 2: The Deceptive Peace Plan [*] (8 min)

- **The Offer:** Hamor and Shechem propose intermarriage and economic
  integration (Gen 34:8-12).
  - Sounds reasonable, tolerant, even beneficial on the surface ("trade ye in
    the land," v. 10).
  - `[Write on board: Worldly Solution: Assimilation]`
- **The Underlying Threat:** This proposal aimed to absorb Jacob's family into
  the pagan culture, erasing their distinct identity as God's people (cf. Deut
  7:3-4).
  - It was a temptation to trade spiritual birthright for worldly comfort and
    acceptance.
  - **(RQ)** How does the world today offer compromises that seem appealing but
    ultimately dilute our commitment to God? (e.g., redefining morality,
    prioritizing wealth/status over faithfulness).
- **The Deception:** Shechem's desire was primarily selfish ("his soul clave
  unto Dinah," v. 3; "let me find grace," v. 11), and the offer was a means to
  an end. The sons saw through the surface appeal (Gen 34:13 - "spoke
  deceitfully").
- `[Aside: Notice the contrast between Shechem's intense desire for Dinah (v.3, 8) and the lack of any mention of repentance for his violent act. Worldly sorrow often focuses on consequences, not the sin itself (cf. 2 Cor 7:10).]`

### Section 3: Responding to Defilement - Wrong Ways & Right Principles (12 min)

- **Wrong Response #1: Jacob's Passivity/Fear:** Jacob heard, but "held his
  peace" initially (Gen 34:5). Later, his primary concern seems to be reputation
  and safety ("ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants,"
  Gen 34:30).
  - While prudence has a place, his reaction lacked righteous indignation
    against sin and decisive spiritual leadership.
- **Wrong Response #2: Simeon & Levi's Vengeance:** Deceit, treachery, and
  excessive violence (Gen 34:13-17, 25-29).
  - Their anger, while perhaps initially sparked by injustice, became sinful and
    uncontrolled (cf. Eph 4:26). They took matters into their own hands with
    carnal weapons.
  - `[Write on board: Wrong Responses: 1. Fearful Passivity (v.5, 30) 2. Carnal Vengeance (v.25-29)]`
  - Jacob later condemned their anger and self-will (Gen 49:5-7).
- **The Underlying Principle Violated:** Failure to maintain separation from
  worldliness leads to entanglement and ungodly responses.
  - "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man
    love the world, the love of the Father is not in him." (1 John 2:15).
  - Worldly methods (deceit, violence) were used to solve a problem caused by
    worldly association.
  - **(RQ)** When faced with sin's impact (personal or communal), how do we
    ensure our response is godly grief and righteous action, not fearful
    compromise or carnal anger? (cf. 2 Cor 7:10-11).
- `[Aside: It's a stark reminder that even God's chosen people are capable of terrible sin when they neglect His counsel and rely on their own wisdom or strength. Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 205, comments on Jacob's lack of immediate seeking of God's counsel here.]`

### Conclusion: Cleansing, Consecration, and Commitment (10 min)

- **The Need/Question (from text):** After such compromise and defilement, how
  can spiritual purity and fellowship with God be restored? (Implied by Gen 34's
  disaster).
- **The Biblical Principle & God's Solution:** God calls Jacob _away_ from
  Shechem and _towards_ Bethel (House of God) (Gen 35:1). Restoration requires
  returning to God and His appointed place/way.
  - This involves active cleansing and consecration: "Put away the strange
    gods... be clean, and change your garments" (Gen 35:2).
  - `[Write on board: God's Solution: Separation -> Consecration -> Obedience (Gen 35:1-4)]`
  - Burying the idols and earrings (symbols of paganism and vanity) under the
    oak was a decisive act of renunciation (Gen 35:4).
- **Bridging (from text to life):** Just as Jacob's family had to actively put
  away idols, we must identify and remove influences, habits, or associations
  that compromise our relationship with God (2 Cor 6:17).
  - This isn't about physical location only, but about heart allegiance and
    lifestyle choices. What "strange gods" (idols of materialism, entertainment,
    self, etc.) do we need to bury?
- **Actionable Steps (derived from Gen 35:1-4 & 2 Cor 6:17):**
  1.  **Identify & Separate:** Prayerfully identify any "unclean thing" or
      worldly entanglement in your life (media, relationships, habits) and make
      a conscious decision to separate from it (2 Cor 6:17).
  2.  **Cleanse & Renew:** Seek God's forgiveness and cleansing (1 John 1:9).
      Actively replace worldly influences with spiritual nourishment – Bible
      study, prayer, godly fellowship (cf. "change your garments" - symbolic of
      new life).
  3.  **Consecrate & Obey:** Recommit to following God's specific will for your
      life, even if it means leaving a comfortable "Shechem" for a perhaps less
      convenient "Bethel" (Gen 35:1, 3). Prioritize communion with Him.
- **Illustration:** Like cleaning a polluted well. You don't just stop adding
  pollutants; you must actively pump out the contaminated water and ensure only
  clean water flows in. Separation (stopping pollution) + Consecration (active
  cleansing and refilling with pure source).
- **Invitation:** God's call to "come out... be separate... and I will receive
  you" (2 Cor 6:17) is a promise of acceptance and intimate fellowship. Will we
  respond like Jacob eventually did, putting away all that hinders and returning
  wholeheartedly to God? Let's choose purity and obedience today.
