### Introduction (5 min)

-   Welcome & Prayer
-   The Universal Quest: What defines 'life'? Is it just existence? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce the core biblical concept: True life is found only in a specific relationship.
-   Read Central Verse: 1 John 5:11-12. Emphasize the exclusivity and source.
    -   `[Whiteboard: LIFE = IN THE SON (1 John 5:11-12)]`
-   Goal: To understand what this 'life in the Son' means and how to possess it, based on God's Word.

### Section 1: The Source and Nature of Life (10 min)

-   **God's Gift: Eternal Life** (1 John 5:11)
    -   Life isn't earned, it's *given* by God.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Eternal Life = GIFT (1 John 5:11)]`
    -   This life is located *exclusively* in His Son.
-   **The Quality of Life in Christ** (John 10:10)
    -   Read John 10:10. Contrast thief's purpose (steal, kill, destroy) with Christ's (life more abundantly).
    -   What does 'abundant' life mean? **(RQ)** Is it just material wealth or something deeper? `[Discuss spiritual vitality, purpose, peace derived from relationship with the Giver of Life]`
    -   Connect to Ephesians 2:1 - From spiritual death to life.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Abundant Life (John 10:10) vs. Spiritual Death (Eph 2:1)]`
    -   This isn't just future life, but a transformed existence *now*.
-   **Victory Over Death** (John 11:25-26; 1 Cor 15:55, 57)
    -   Read John 11:25-26. Jesus *is* the resurrection and the life.
    -   Belief in Him transcends physical death.
    -   Read 1 Cor 15:55, 57. Victory over death is assured *through* Christ.
    -   `[Analogy (from 1 Cor 15): Death's 'sting' removed like a bee losing its stinger - rendered powerless for the believer in Christ]`

### Section 2: Receiving Life Through Faith [*] (12 min)

-   **The Condition: Possessing the Son** (1 John 5:12)
    -   Re-read 1 John 5:12. The clear division: Have the Son = Have Life. No Son = No Life.
    -   How do we 'have' the Son? **(RQ)**
-   **Faith is the Key** (1 John 5:13; Mark 2:5)
    -   Read 1 John 5:13. Life comes through *believing* on the name of the Son of God.
    -   Read Mark 2:5. Jesus saw their *faith* and acted.
    -   `[Whiteboard: FAITH (in Jesus' Name) -> RECEIVE LIFE (1 John 5:13)]`
    -   Faith isn't just intellectual agreement, but trust and reliance.
-   **The Crucial Test: Belief vs. Unbelief** (John 3:18)
    -   Read John 3:18. The dividing line is belief in Him.
    -   Unbelief isn't neutral; it results in condemnation already.
    -   This highlights God's desire for all to live (John 11:25-26) but respects individual choice.
    -   `[Aside: It's like refusing a life-saving antidote offered freely. The refusal itself seals the fate, not a vindictive act from the one offering help.]`
-   **Practical Application: What Does Believing Look Like?**
    -   Need/Question (from John 3:18): How do I ensure I am 'believing' and not 'condemned already'? **(RQ)**
    -   Biblical Principle (from 1 John 5:12-13): Actively trusting in Jesus as the *only* source of life.
    -   Bridge to Practice: Daily choices reflect who/what we truly trust for life, meaning, security.
    -   Action Steps (derived from verses):
        1.  Consciously acknowledge Jesus as your life source daily (1 John 5:12).
        2.  Read His words to strengthen belief (cf. Rom 10:17).
        3.  Act on His teachings, demonstrating trust (cf. James 2:17).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Action -> Trust Jesus Daily (1 John 5:12), Read Word, Obey]`

### Section 3: Assurance and Security in Christ (12 min)

-   **Certainty, Not Feelings** (1 John 5:9-10, 13)
    -   Read 1 John 5:9-10. God's testimony about His Son is greater than any human witness (or feeling).
    -   Read 1 John 5:13 again. These things are written so we may *know* we have eternal life.
    -   Assurance rests on the objective truth of God's Word, not subjective emotions.
    -   `[Whiteboard: ASSURANCE = God's Word (1 John 5:9-10, 13) > Feelings]`
    -   How does relying on feelings undermine faith? **(RQ)**
-   **Christ Keeps His Own** (2 Tim 1:12)
    -   Read 2 Tim 1:12. Paul's confidence: "I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that *he is able* to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
    -   Our security isn't in our ability to hold on, but in *His* ability to keep us.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Security = CHRIST'S ABILITY (2 Tim 1:12)]`
    -   What have we committed to Him? Our lives, our salvation, our future.
-   **The Nature of the Gift: Eternal** (1 John 5:11)
    -   Revisit 1 John 5:11. The gift is *eternal* life.
    -   If it's truly eternal, can it be temporary? **(RQ)**
    -   This assurance provides peace and stability in a chaotic world (connects back to 'abundant life' in John 10:10).
    -   `[Aside: Think of a legal deed. Once the property is legally gifted and transferred, the giver doesn't snatch it back based on the recipient's mood. God's gift, sealed by His promise (His 'record' - 1 John 5:11), is far more secure.]`
-   **Living in Assurance** (Based on 1 John 5:13)
    -   Knowing we have eternal life should impact how we live: with confidence, purpose, and freedom from the fear of condemnation (cf. Rom 8:1).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary of God's Record** (2 min)
    -   Recap the core message from 1 John 5:11-12: God *has given* us eternal life. This life is *in His Son*.
    -   Therefore, having the Son means having life (John 10:10, John 11:25-26).
    -   We receive the Son through faith (1 John 5:13, John 3:18).
    -   And we can *know* we have this life based on God's Word (1 John 5:13, 2 Tim 1:12).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Review key terms: GIFT -> IN THE SON -> FAITH -> ASSURANCE]`
-   **The Defining Question** (2 min)
    -   Re-read 1 John 5:12 slowly: "He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
    -   The most important question anyone can answer: Do you *have* the Son? **(RQ)**
    -   This isn't about church membership or good deeds alone, but about a personal, trusting relationship with Jesus Christ as the source of life.
    -   Reflect on the Action Steps: Are you actively trusting Him daily?
-   **Invitation** (1-2 min)
    -   If you haven't received this gift of life found only in Jesus, God's Word invites you today. It's a matter of believing God's record about His Son (1 John 5:10-11) and receiving Him by faith.
    -   If you *do* have the Son, live in the joy and assurance He provides (1 John 5:13). Don't let doubts or feelings overshadow God's clear promises. Trust Him who is able to keep you (2 Tim 1:12).
-   **Closing Thought & Prayer Focus:** Let's thank God for the incredible, secure gift of eternal life offered freely through His Son. Pray for faith to receive it and assurance to live in its reality.
