name, Forever blest."

**Closing Hymn:** #330 "Take Time to Be Holy" "Take time to be holy, speak oft

### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** What does it _mean_ for a church to be truly worshiping? Is it just
  singing and listening? **(RQ)**
- Define Worship: More than ritual; a conscious reach for God's presence and
  beauty (Psalm 96:9).
  - `[Whiteboard: Worship = Reaching for God's Presence & Beauty (Ps 96:9)]`
- Central Question: How do we ensure our gatherings are genuine encounters with
  the Divine, as God desires? (John 4:23-24)
- Outline Preview: We'll explore God's designated time, the true focus, the
  powerful results, and the necessary heart attitude for worship that pleases
  Him.

### Section 1: The Divine Invitation & Time (8 min)

- **God Initiates Worship:** He seeks worshippers (John 4:23). It's His desire
  to meet with us.
- **The Designated Time:** God set apart a specific time for corporate rest and
  worship.
  - Scripture: Exodus 20:8-11 - The Fourth Commandment.
    - `[Whiteboard: Exodus 20:8-11 - Remember the Sabbath]`
    - Emphasize: Not just _a_ day, but _the_ seventh day, sanctified by God.
    - Purpose: Holy convocation, a time to cease worldly labor and focus on Him.
- **The Gathering Imperative:** Importance of assembling together.
  - Scripture: Hebrews 10:25 - Encouraging one another, especially as the Day
    approaches.
  - Why gather? Corporate strength, mutual encouragement, unified focus.
    **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Central Focus - Meeting Christ (10 min)

- **The Core Purpose:** Why do we gather on Sabbath?
  - Scripture: Matthew 18:20 - "For where two or three are gathered together in
    my name, there am I in the midst of them."
    - `[Whiteboard: Matt 18:20 -> Jesus' Promised Presence]`
  - The goal isn't just fulfilling an obligation, but _meeting the resurrected
    Christ_.
- **Recognizing His Presence:** The disciples' experience.
  - Scripture: John 20:19-20 - Jesus appears, shows hands/side, disciples are
    glad _when they saw the Lord_.
    - `[Whiteboard: John 20:20 -> Seeing Jesus = Joy]`
  - Our worship should facilitate this recognition. How? **(RQ)** Through
    prayer, studying His Word, fellowship, focusing hearts on Him.
- **Simplicity:** The profound truth is simply meeting _Him_. Have we
  complicated this? **(RQ)**
  - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Is Christ truly the ambassador we present?]`

### Section 3: The Sacred Results of Encounter [*] (10 min)

- **Beyond the Meeting:** What happens when we truly encounter Christ in
  worship?
  - Scripture: John 20:21-23 - The immediate results for the disciples.
    - `[Whiteboard: Results (John 20:21-23)]`
- **Result 1: Peace:** "Peace be unto you." (v. 21)
  - Not just absence of conflict, but divine assurance and calm amidst life's
    storms.
  - `[Whiteboard: 1. Peace]`
- **Result 2: Commission:** "As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you."
  (v. 21)
  - Worship empowers and directs us for service/mission outside the church
    walls.
  - `[Whiteboard: 2. Commission (Service)]`
  - `[Analogy (from verse): Worship as the 'huddle' before the 'play' - receiving instructions & encouragement from the Coach (Christ) for the mission ahead.]`
- **Result 3: Holy Spirit Power:** "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." (v. 22)
  - The enabling power for witness and living the Christian life.
  - `[Whiteboard: 3. Holy Spirit Power (Witness)]`
- **Result 4: Authority/Responsibility:** Forgiveness/Retention of sins
  (v. 23) - Reflecting God's character, sharing the terms of forgiveness found
  in Christ.
  - `[Whiteboard: 4. Authority (Share Gospel)]`
- **Connection:** True worship isn't an end, but a catalyst for peace, service,
  and Spirit-filled living.

### Section 4: The Manner of Approach (7 min)

- **Attitude Matters:** How should we come before a Holy God?
  - Scripture: John 4:24 - "In spirit and in truth."
    - `[Whiteboard: Worship How? -> Spirit & Truth (John 4:24)]`
  - **Spirit:** Sincerity, heart engagement, dependence on the Holy Spirit. Not
    just outward form.
  - **Truth:** According to God's revealed will (His Word), centered on Christ.
    Not based on human invention or feeling alone.
  - `[Analogy (from verse): Worshiping in Spirit and Truth is like using a correct map (Truth) with a genuine desire to reach the destination (Spirit). One without the other leads you astray or leaves you standing still.]`
- **Humility & Reverence:** Avoiding casualness or presumption.
  - Spirit of Prophecy Insight: "Humility and reverence should characterize the
    deportment of all who come into the presence of God." (Patriarchs and
    Prophets, p. 252).
    - `[Whiteboard: Key Attitudes: Humility, Reverence]`
  - Why is reverence important? Acknowledges God's holiness and majesty.
    **(RQ)** (cf. Isaiah 6:1-5)
- **Putting Away Hindrances:** What prevents true worship?
  - Spirit of Prophecy Insight: Requires putting away self-worship, fostering
    love for God and others. (Bible Commentaries, Vol. 7, p. 939).
    - `[Whiteboard: Remove: Self-worship. Foster: Love (God & Others)]`
  - Self-reflection: Are we coming to give or just to get? Are our hearts right
    with God and our brethren? **(RQ)**
  - `[Aside: Instead of focusing only on what we get *from* the service, consider what we bring *to* the worship of our King. It's like visiting royalty – preparation and attitude matter immensely.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** True worship is a Sabbath encounter with the living Christ (Matt
  18:20, John 20:20), approached in spirit, truth, humility, and reverence (John
  4:24, PP 252), resulting in peace, commission, and Spirit-power (John
  20:21-23).
- **The Invitation:** God seeks true worshippers (John 4:23). Will we be among
  them?
- **Practical Steps (Derived from Study):**
  1.  **Prepare:** Consecrate Sabbath eve; prepare hearts for meeting Christ.
  2.  **Focus:** Intentionally seek Christ's presence during the service (Matt
      18:20).
  3.  **Receive & Respond:** Be open to His peace, His commission, His Spirit
      (John 20:21-22).
  4.  **Examine:** Approach with humility, reverence, and love, in Spirit and
      Truth (John 4:24, BC 7:939).
      - `[Whiteboard: Action: Prepare, Focus, Receive/Respond, Examine]`
- **Final Thought:** Let our gatherings be less about routine and more about a
  genuine, transformative rendezvous with our Savior.
- **Prayer:** Closing prayer dedicating our worship experiences to truly meeting
  and honoring Christ.
