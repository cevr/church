### Introduction (5 min)
-   Welcome & Opening Prayer.
-   Introduce Topic: What does *true* dedication look like, especially within the family of faith?
-   Beyond surface-level commitment – exploring deep, self-sacrificial love grounded in Scripture.
-   Central Question: How does Christ's example shape our dedication to God and each other? **(RQ)**
-   Briefly state the goal: To understand biblical dedication and its power for character transformation, drawing directly from Scripture.
-   Read Central Verse: John 15:13.
    -   `[Whiteboard: True Dedication = Laying Down Life (John 15:13)]`

### Section 1: The Ultimate Example (John 15:13) (8 min)
-   **The Need:** We often limit 'love' to feelings. What is the biblical standard presented here? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle (John 15:13):**
    -   Focus on Christ's statement: The *greatest* love involves ultimate sacrifice.
    -   Context: Jesus speaking to disciples before His death – this wasn't theoretical. `[Aside: Notice Jesus calls them 'friends' (v. 14-15), not just servants. This sacrificial love is rooted in relationship, not just duty.]`
    -   `[Whiteboard: John 15:13 -> Greatest Love = Self-Sacrifice]`
    -   This isn't just physical death, but laying down our will, desires, time, resources for others, following Christ's pattern.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** How does Christ's ultimate sacrifice set the pattern for our daily lives, not just in extreme circumstances? **(RQ)** `(cf. John 15:12 - "love one another *as I have loved you*")`
    -   It's the *motivation* and the *model*.
-   **Actionable Step (Implied):** Reflect daily: Am I living primarily for myself, or consciously laying down my 'life' (priorities, comfort, preferences) for Christ and others? `[Link to John 15:13]`

### Section 2: Perceiving & Reflecting God's Love (1 John 3:16) (10 min) [*]
-   **The Need:** How do we truly *understand* and internalize this kind of love?
-   **Biblical Principle (1 John 3:16):**
    -   We *perceive* (understand, recognize, know) God's love by looking intently at Christ's sacrifice (`"because he laid down his life for us"`).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Perceive Love (1 John 3:16) -> Christ's Sacrifice]`
    -   The logical consequence and obligation: We *ought* to reflect this same love towards fellow believers (`"and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren"`).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Our Response (1 John 3:16) -> Lay Down Lives for Brethren]`
    -   This isn't optional; it's the evidence of God's love dwelling in us and proof of genuine faith (`cf. 1 John 3:17-18`).
-   **Bridging to Practice:** If Christ's sacrifice is the measure, how does our practical love for fellow church members stack up against this standard set in 1 John 3:16? **(RQ)**
    -   `[Brief Illustration Concept (Biblical): Story of Dorcas (Acts 9:36-42) - practical love and service ("full of good works and almsdeeds") as 'laying down life' in daily ways.]`
-   **Actionable Steps (from 1 John 3:16-18):**
    1.  Actively look for and meet the tangible needs among brethren when we have the means (`1 John 3:17`).
    2.  Love not just in word or talk, but genuinely in deed and in truth (`1 John 3:18`).

### Section 3: The Mindset of Dedication (Philippians 2:3-5; Romans 12:10) (10 min)
-   **The Need:** What internal attitude fosters this outward dedication?
-   **Biblical Principle (Philippians 2:3-5; Romans 12:10):**
    -   Requires humility (`"lowliness of mind"`) - seeing others as valuable (`"esteem other better than themselves"`) (Phil 2:3). `[Aside: 'Lowliness of mind' (tapeinophrosuné) isn't self-deprecation, but humility rooted in recognizing our dependence on God and the value He places on others.]`
    -   Requires shifting focus from self-interest to the interests of others (`"Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others"`) (Phil 2:4).
    -   Requires adopting Christ's own mindset (`"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus"`) (Phil 2:5).
    -   Requires genuine affection and preferring others (`"Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another"`) (Rom 12:10).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Mindset: Humility (Phil 2:3) + Others-Focused (Phil 2:4) + Christ's Mind (Phil 2:5) + Affection/Preference (Rom 12:10)]`
-   **Bridging to Practice:** How can we cultivate this mindset when our natural tendency is self-preservation and self-focus? **(RQ)** `(cf. Phil 2:5 - It's about letting Christ's mind be *in* us)`
-   **Actionable Steps (from Phil 2:3-4; Rom 12:10):**
    1.  Pray specifically for humility and the mind of Christ (`Phil 2:5`).
    2.  Intentionally look for ways to honour and prefer others in conversations and actions this week (`Rom 12:10`).
    3.  Practice asking about and considering others' needs before your own (`Phil 2:4`).

### Section 4: Dedication in Action: Bearing Burdens (Galatians 6:2) (7 min)
-   **The Need:** What is a tangible way this dedicated love is expressed in community?
-   **Biblical Principle (Galatians 6:2):**
    -   Actively carrying each other's burdens (struggles, sorrows, temptations, practical needs).
    -   `[Whiteboard: Gal 6:2 -> Bear Burdens = Fulfill Law of Christ]`
    -   This action is presented as the fulfillment of the "law of Christ" – the law of love.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** What kind of "burdens" exist in our church family right now that need carrying, according to Galatians 6:2? **(RQ)** How does this differ from enabling sin (`cf. Gal 6:1 - restore gently`) or neglecting personal responsibility (`cf. Gal 6:5 - bear own load`)?
-   **Actionable Steps (from Gal 6:2):**
    1.  Identify someone this week who seems burdened and offer specific, practical help or prayerful support (`Gal 6:2`).
    2.  Be willing to share your own burdens appropriately with trusted fellow believers, allowing them to fulfill the law of Christ towards you (`Gal 6:2`).

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
-   **Summary:** True dedication isn't just a feeling; it's love in action, modeled by Christ's ultimate sacrifice (John 15:13). We perceive it through His death (1 John 3:16), cultivate it through humility and an others-focused mindset (Phil 2:3-5; Rom 12:10), and express it by bearing one another's burdens (Gal 6:2).
-   **Revisit Central Question:** Christ's example is everything – the standard, the motivation, the enabling power through His Spirit.
-   **Invitation:** Will you ask God this week to show you one specific way you can "lay down your life" – your time, your resources, your comfort – for a brother or sister in Christ, fulfilling His law of love? Let's commit to being a community marked by this true, biblical dedication.
-   Closing Prayer.
