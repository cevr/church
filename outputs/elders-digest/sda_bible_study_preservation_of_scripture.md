### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Can we truly trust a book written thousands of years ago, passed through
  countless hands? **(RQ)**
- Topic Introduction: Today we explore the incredible story of how God preserved
  His Holy Scriptures.
- Central Verse: Matthew 24:35 - Jesus' own guarantee of His Word's endurance.
  `[Write on board: Matt 24:35 - "My words shall not pass away"]`
- Study Roadmap: We'll examine:
  1.  God's explicit _promise_ to preserve His Word.
  2.  His _power_ demonstrated in its historical survival.
  3.  His _providence_ guiding its accurate transmission.

### Section 1: God's Unbreakable Promise (10 min)

- Foundation: God didn't just inspire Scripture; He promised to safeguard it.
- Psalm 12:6-7: God's words are pure (divine origin) and He _will_ preserve
  them.
  - `[Write on board: Ps 12:6-7 - PURE & PRESERVED]`
  - Emphasize: "Thou shalt keep them... Thou shalt preserve them" - God's active
    role.
  - What does God's active preservation imply about the reliability of the text
    we have? **(RQ)**
- Isaiah 40:8: Contrast human transience with the eternal nature of God's Word.
  - `[Whiteboard: Isa 40:8 - Grass Withers vs. Word Stands]`
  - How does this eternal nature provide an anchor in our rapidly changing
    world? **(RQ)**
- 1 Peter 1:23-25: The Word is living, enduring, and the means of spiritual
  rebirth.
  - Preservation is linked to its saving power ("born again... by the word").
  - `[Whiteboard: 1 Pet 1:23-25 - Living, Abiding Word -> New Birth]`
- Matthew 5:18: Jesus affirmed the permanence of every detail of Scripture.
  - `[Briefly mention Matt 5:18 - Jot/Tittle permanence]`
  - If Jesus expressed such confidence in Scripture's endurance, how should that
    impact our own view? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Surviving the Fires of History [*] (12 min)

- Transition: God's promise faced intense opposition throughout history.
- Case Study 1: Jeremiah 36 - King Jehoiakim's defiance.
  - Summarize Jer. 36:21-23: The king contemptuously burns God's message.
  - God's Response (Jer. 36:27-28, 32): Command to rewrite, adding _more_
    content.
  - `[Write on board: Jer 36 - Burned -> Rewritten + Added]`
  - What does God's response teach us about the ultimate authority and survival
    of His Word? **(RQ)**
- Case Study 2: Emperor Diocletian (c. 303 AD).
  - Describe the empire-wide persecution aiming to destroy Scriptures and
    churches.
  - Result: Utter failure; the Word and the Church endured and grew.
  - `[Whiteboard: Diocletian (303 AD) - Attempted Eradication -> Failed]`
- Case Study 3: Voltaire (18th Century).
  - [Illustration Concept: Historical Irony] Mention the widely cited story of
    his boast against the Bible and the later use of his house by a Bible
    society. (Note as historical anecdote).
  - `[Whiteboard: Voltaire vs. Bible Society?]`
- Key Point: The Bible's survival isn't accidental; it's evidence of God's
  supernatural power fulfilling His promise (Ps 12:7).
  `[Link Survival -> God's Power]`

### Section 3: Providence in Preservation & Profit (12 min)

- Transition: Beyond dramatic survival, God employed careful human stewardship.
- Old Testament Transmission: The Role of Scribes (esp. Masoretes, c. 500-1000
  AD).
  - Describe their meticulous methods: counting letters, words, verses to ensure
    accuracy.
    `[Write on board: Masoretes - Meticulous Copying (Counting letters)]`
  - This reflects God's _providence_ – His guiding hand in the process.
  - [Aside: The Dead Sea Scrolls discovery was remarkable. Finding manuscripts
    centuries older than previously known, they showed incredible agreement with
    the Masoretic text we already had. It's like finding an ancient blueprint
    that perfectly matches the building standing today, confirming the careful
    transmission.]
  - How does understanding this painstaking process bolster our faith in the
    OT's reliability? **(RQ)**
- New Testament Transmission: Abundant Manuscript Evidence.
  - Briefly note the vast number of early NT manuscripts compared to other
    ancient writings. `[Whiteboard: NT - Many Early Manuscripts]`
  - God ensured rapid, widespread copying.
- Affirming Confidence: We can trust that the Bible we have today accurately
  reflects the original message. Minor textual variations do not impact core
  doctrines.
- Purpose of Preservation: Inspiration & Usefulness (2 Tim 3:16-17).
  - The _preserved_ Word is the _inspired_ Word, profitable for life.
  - `[Link Preservation -> Inspiration -> Profitability]`
  - EGW Connection: Briefly cite _Education_, p. 191 (Bible as comprehensive
    history) and _Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students_, p. 462 (Bible
    points to eternal life). `[Note EGW refs]`
  - The whole Bible (OT & NT) reveals Christ and equips us (doctrine, reproof,
    correction, instruction).
    `[Whiteboard: Purpose (2 Tim 3:16-17) -> Doctrine, Reproof, Correction, Instruction -> Reveals Christ]`
