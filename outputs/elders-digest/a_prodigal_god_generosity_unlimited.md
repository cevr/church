### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15) - often focuses on the
  son, but what about the Father's extravagant welcome? God's 'prodigal'
  (lavish, reckless) generosity.
- **Central Idea:** God's generosity isn't just abundant; it's sacrificial and
  transformative, originating in Christ's own self-emptying.
- **Core Question:** How does understanding the _depth_ of God's giving change
  how we receive and how we give? **(RQ)**
- **Roadmap:** Explore Christ's sacrifice, our need, God's provision, and our
  response.

### Section 1: The Ultimate Sacrifice - Christ's Impoverishment (10 min)

- **Christ's Pre-existent Glory:**
  - He was _rich_ (2 Cor 8:9a) - What does this mean?
  - Equal with God, possessing divine glory (Phil 2:6; John 17:5).
  - Commander of Heaven, Creator (Col 1:16).
  - `[Write on board: Christ's Riches: Glory, Power, Deity (Phil 2:6)]`
- **The Depth of His Sacrifice:**
  - He _became poor_ (2 Cor 8:9b) - Voluntary act.
  - Emptied Himself, took human form, humbled Himself to death (Phil 2:7-8).
  - From throne to manger, to cross - ultimate descent.
  - `[Draw simple arrow: Heaven's Glory -> Earth's Poverty -> Cross]`
- **For Our Sakes:**
  - Purpose: _that ye through his poverty might be rich_ (2 Cor 8:9c).
  - His loss was entirely for our gain. **(RQ)** Have we grasped the cost?
  - `[Analogy: A king trading his crown and palace for rags to rescue a beggar.]`

### Section 2: Our Need & God's Lavish Provision (12 min) [*]

- **Humanity's Spiritual Poverty:**
  - _All_ have sinned and fall short (Rom 3:23).
  - Spiritually bankrupt, dead in trespasses (Eph 2:1).
  - Unable to earn salvation or meet God's standard.
  - `[Write on board: Our State: Sinful, Short, Spiritually Poor (Rom 3:23, Eph 2:1)]`
- **God's Extravagant Grace:**
  - _But God_, rich in mercy... (Eph 2:4-5).
  - Riches of His grace lavished upon us (Eph 1:7-8).
  - Grace defined: Unmerited favor + Divine enabling power.
  - `[Write on board: God's Provision: GRACE (Eph 1:7-8) = Forgiveness + Hope + Power]`
- **The Riches We Receive:**
  - Forgiveness of sins (Eph 1:7).
  - Adoption as children (Eph 1:5).
  - Hope of eternal life (Titus 1:2).
  - Peace with God (Rom 5:1).
  - Access to God's power (Eph 1:19).
  - The 'whole treasury of heaven' is open to us (Ref: Christ's Object Lessons,
    p. 147-148 concept).
  - `[Aside: Think of it - the resources that created galaxies are available to help us overcome impatience or temptation. That's the scale of grace offered! (Based on Eph 1:19)]`

### Section 3: Our Response to Infinite Generosity (12 min)

- **Acknowledging the Gift:**
  - True gratitude moves beyond words to action. **(RQ)** How does God's
    generosity impact our priorities?
- **Sacrificial Giving - Stewardship:**
  - The Tithe Principle: Returning God's portion (Mal 3:8-10).
    - Not a payment, but an acknowledgement of His ownership.
    - God's challenge: Test Me... see if I won't pour out blessing (Mal 3:10).
    - `[Write on board: Response 1: Faithful Stewardship (Mal 3:10) - Acknowledge Ownership]`
  - Offerings: Given freely out of gratitude (2 Cor 9:7).
    - Reflects God's cheerful giving.
- **Sacrificial Self-Surrender:**
  - Present your bodies as a living sacrifice (Rom 12:1).
  - This is our reasonable service/worship.
  - Yielding our will, time, talents – everything – to Him who gave His all.
  - `[Write on board: Response 2: Total Surrender (Rom 12:1) - Living Sacrifice]`
  - `[Metaphor: Like a mirror reflecting the sun's light, our generosity should reflect God's.]`
  - `[Aside: Our church buildings and ministries function best when fueled by hearts overflowing with gratitude for Christ's sacrifice, not just obligation. It shifts from duty to delight. (Connects Rom 12:1 to practical church life)]`
- **The Motivation:**
  - Not to earn favor, but because we've _received_ immeasurable favor (1 John
    4:19).
  - Love, compelled by the love of Christ (2 Cor 5:14).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen Christ's incredible journey from riches to poverty for
  us (2 Cor 8:9), contrasted with our spiritual poverty met by God's lavish
  grace (Eph 1:7-8). His generosity calls for a response of faithful stewardship
  (Mal 3:10) and complete self-surrender (Rom 12:1).
- **Revisit Central Idea:** God truly is 'prodigal' – recklessly generous – in
  His love and grace towards us.
- **Final Question:** Knowing the price Christ paid (Phil 2:8) and the riches
  offered (Eph 1:7), how will we respond _this week_ to His unlimited
  generosity? **(RQ)**
- **Appeal:**
  - Invitation to accept the riches of His grace if you haven't.
  - Invitation for believers to recommit to reflecting God's generosity through
    faithful stewardship and surrendered lives.
  - Prayer of commitment.
