### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Opening Question:** What feels truly *impossible* in your life right now? A situation? A habit? A relationship? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce theme: Our human perspective is limited, but God's power is not.
-   Read Central Verse: Jeremiah 32:17. Emphasize "nothing too hard for thee."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Jeremiah 32:17 - NOTHING too hard for God]`
-   Brief overview: Today we explore *what the Bible reveals* about the scope of God's power – to save, restore, provide, and overcome.

### Section 1: Power to Save the 'Impossible' (12 min)

-   **The Need:** People we deem 'too far gone', habits deeply entrenched, hearts seemingly hardened.
-   **Biblical Principle (Luke 18:27):** Focus on the context (rich young ruler). Human effort/assessment falls short.
    -   Read Luke 18:27: "And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Luke 18:27 -> Human Impossibility vs. Divine Possibility]`
    -   **Point:** God's power transcends human judgment of 'savability'. He specializes in the impossible.
-   **Biblical Principle (Ezekiel 36:25-27):** God promises not just forgiveness, but *transformation*.
    -   Read Ezekiel 36:25-27. Focus on "sprinkle clean water," "new heart," "new spirit," "cause you to walk."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Ezekiel 36:25-27 = Cleansing + New Heart + New Spirit + Enabling Power]`
    -   **Point:** God has power to fully restore those fallen into serious sin, changing the very nature.
    -   **(RQ):** Do we limit God's restorative power in our minds when we look at ourselves or others? How does Ezekiel challenge that?
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Think of someone (even yourself) you might have subconsciously labeled 'hopeless'. How does Luke 18:27 & Ezekiel 36 change the prayer for them/yourself?
-   **Actionable Step:** Pray specifically this week, citing Luke 18:27, for one 'impossible' situation or person, asking God to demonstrate His power.

### Section 2: Power Beyond Natural Limits & Knowing All [*] (10 min)

-   **The Need:** Situations where natural solutions seem non-existent; the reality of divine awareness.
-   **Biblical Principle (Mark 10:27):** Reiteration of God's limitless capability, often involving the supernatural.
    -   Read Mark 10:27: "...With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Mark 10:27 = ALL things possible (Natural & Supernatural)]`
    -   **Point:** God's power isn't bound by the laws of physics or human limitations. He can intervene supernaturally.
    -   `[Brief Illustration Concept (from Bible): Manna in wilderness (Ex 16) - provision outside natural means]`
-   **Biblical Principle (Matthew 12:36):** God's power includes omniscience and accountability.
    -   Read Matthew 12:36: "But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Matt 12:36 -> God Knows ALL (even words) -> Accountability]`
    -   **Point:** His power encompasses perfect knowledge. Nothing escapes His notice; He holds individuals accountable.
    -   **(RQ):** How does knowing God hears *every* word (Matt 12:36) connect to His power and our need for His grace (1 John 1:9)?
-   `[Aside: Sometimes we treat God's power like a vending machine for miracles, forgetting His power also includes perfect knowledge and justice. True faith embraces both His ability to intervene and His wisdom in how and when He does so, always trusting His character revealed in Christ.]`
-   **Bridging/Action:** Acknowledge God's total awareness (Matt 12:36) as motivation for seeking His cleansing (1 John 1:9) and trusting His intervention (Mark 10:27) even when it seems illogical.

### Section 3: Power to Provide & Purify (12 min)

-   **The Need:** Material needs, financial stress; the deeper need for spiritual purity and character perfection, especially now.
-   **Biblical Principle (Philippians 4:19):** God's resources are limitless, tied to His glory in Christ.
    -   Read Philippians 4:19: "But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Phil 4:19 = Need Supplied -> Source: God's Riches -> Channel: Christ Jesus]`
    -   **Point:** God can provide resources supernaturally, enabling faithfulness and generosity beyond apparent means.
    -   `[Analogy (from verse): God's supply isn't limited by our bank account, but by His infinite 'riches in glory'. We access it through faith in Christ.]`
-   **Biblical Principle (1 John 1:9):** The ultimate power application – cleansing from sin through Christ.
    -   Read 1 John 1:9: "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
    -   `[Whiteboard: 1 John 1:9 = Confession -> Forgiveness (Just) + Cleansing (Faithful)]`
    -   **Point:** Christ's blood has infinite power to cleanse believers from *every* spot and stain, essential for character perfection.
    -   **(RQ):** Do we fully grasp the power in "cleanse us from ALL unrighteousness"? What does that mean for victory over sin?
-   **Urgency ('Than Now'):** Connect to Romans 13:11 ("knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.")
    -   In these last days, the need to grasp and claim God's power (for provision, for purity, for witness) is greater than ever.
    -   `[Aside: Just as early Advent believers learned to trust God for daily bread while proclaiming unpopular truths, we must learn to rely radically on His power—both for physical needs and for the deep character transformation needed to reflect Christ fully before His return.]`
-   **Actionable Steps:** 1. Identify one area of need (material or spiritual) and claim Philippians 4:19 in prayer. 2. Practice specific confession based on 1 John 1:9, believing in the power to *cleanse*.

### Conclusion: Claiming the Power by Faith (6 min)

-   **Recap:** God's power is limitless: He can save the 'unsavable' (Luke 18:27), restore the broken (Ezek 36), act beyond nature (Mark 10:27), knows all (Matt 12:36), provides abundantly (Phil 4:19), and purifies completely (1 John 1:9).
-   **The Key (Hebrews 11:6):** This power is accessed through faith.
    -   Read Hebrews 11:6: "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Hebrews 11:6 = FAITH -> Believing He IS + Believing He REWARDS Seekers]`
-   **Challenge:** We must move beyond *knowing* God is powerful to *believing* He is powerful *for us*, *in our situation*, *right now*.
-   **(RQ):** What step of faith, based on the verses studied today, will you take this week to claim God's infinite power in your life?
-   **Final Appeal:** Trust Him. Acknowledge Him in *all* your ways (Prov 3:5-6). Believe His promises. Claim His power for provision, for purity, for every impossible situation. He *can* do exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think (Eph 3:20).
-   **Prayer:** Closing prayer focused on faith to believe and claim God's promises and power.
