    -   `[Write on board: Title & Central Question: Who is the Holy Spirit?]`
-   Brief Overview: We'll explore His personality, divinity, and essential work based on Scripture.

### The Personality of the Holy Spirit (12 min)

-   Challenge: Is He merely an impersonal force, influence, or power? **(RQ)** What does the Bible reveal?
-   Biblical Evidence (Demonstrating Personal Attributes):
    -   He Teaches (John 14:26) `[Whiteboard: TEACHES - John 14:26]`
    -   He Testifies (John 15:26)
    -   He Guides into Truth (John 16:13) `[Whiteboard: GUIDES - John 16:13]`
    -   He Speaks (Acts 13:2; 1 Tim 4:1)
    -   He Has a Mind (Rom 8:27 - implied by Rom 8:26 intercession)
    -   He Wills (1 Cor 12:11 - distributes gifts)
    -   He Loves (Rom 15:30 - "love of the Spirit")
    -   He Can Be Grieved (Eph 4:30) `[Whiteboard: GRIEVED - Eph 4:30]`
    -   He Intercedes (Rom 8:26) `[Whiteboard: INTERCEDES - Rom 8:26]`
-   Personal Pronouns: Jesus uses "He" (Greek: *ekeinos*) referring to the Spirit (John 14:26, 15:26, 16:7-8, 13-14).
-   `[Illustration: Think of electricity. It's a powerful force, but it doesn't *decide* where to go or *feel* grieved if misused. The Holy Spirit, however, guides, teaches, wills, and can be grieved (Eph 4:30) – actions of a person, not just a force.]`
-   Spirit of Prophecy Insight: *Desire of Ages*, p. 669 - "The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent..." (Highlights personal, active role).
-   [Aside: "Thinking of the Spirit as just 'power' misses the intimate relationship He desires. It's like valuing someone only for what they *do*, not who they *are*."]

### The Divinity of the Holy Spirit [*] (12 min)

-   Foundation: Not just personal, but Divine – a member of the Godhead.
-   Biblical Evidence (Divine Attributes & Equation with God):
    -   Present & Active at Creation (Gen 1:2) `[Whiteboard: CREATION - Gen 1:2]`
    -   Called God (Acts 5:3-4 - Lying to the Holy Spirit is lying to God) `[Whiteboard: CALLED GOD - Acts 5:3-4]`
    -   Omniscient - Knows the deep things of God (1 Cor 2:10-11) `[Whiteboard: OMNISCIENT - 1 Cor 2:10-11]`
    -   Omnipresent (Psalm 139:7-10)
    -   Eternal (Heb 9:14 - "eternal Spirit")
    -   Source of Divine Power/Miracles (Luke 1:35 - Incarnation; Rom 15:19 - Paul's ministry)
    -   Included in the Godhead Formula (Matt 28:19 - Baptism in the name of Father, Son, *and* Holy Spirit) `[Whiteboard: GODHEAD (Matt 28:19) - Father, Son, Holy Spirit]` `[Draw simple triangle: Father, Son, Spirit - Equal]`
-   Spirit of Prophecy Insight: *Evangelism*, p. 616 - "The Holy Spirit is a person... He must also be a divine person, else He could not search out the secrets which lie hidden in the mind of God."
-   The Trinity Context: Co-equal, co-eternal. **(RQ)** Why is accepting His full divinity essential for our salvation and understanding of God?

### The Indispensable Work of the Holy Spirit (10 min)

-   The Need: We are utterly dependent on Him. **(RQ)** Can we live the Christian life or fulfill God's mission without Him?
-   Essential Roles:
    -   Conviction of Sin, Righteousness, Judgment (John 16:8-11)
    -   Regeneration / New Birth (John 3:5-6; Titus 3:5) `[Whiteboard: Conviction -> Regeneration (New Birth)]`
    -   Indwelling Believers (John 14:17; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 6:19 - Temple)
    -   Sealing for Redemption (Eph 1:13; 4:30) `[Whiteboard: Indwelling -> Sealing]`
    -   Sanctification & Character Transformation (2 Thess 2:13; 2 Cor 3:18; Gal 5:22-23 - Fruit) `[Whiteboard: SANCTIFICATION / FRUIT (Gal 5:22-23)]`
        -   `[Illustration: Like a skilled sculptor (the Spirit) shaping rough stone (our character) into the image of Christ (2 Cor 3:18). It requires our yielding to His tools, not just admiring the potential.]`
    -   Crucial for Character Development: The 'finished work' requires His power. (Connect Rom 8:9, 26 - He helps our infirmities).
    -   Empowerment for Witness & Service (Acts 1:8; 1 Cor 12:4-11 - Gifts) `[Whiteboard: POWER for Witness - Acts 1:8]`
    -   Understanding Scripture (John 16:13; 1 Cor 2:12-14)
    -   The Latter Rain: Essential for the final warning, character perfection, and enduring the end times (Joel 2:23, 28-29; Zech 10:1; Rev 18:1). `[Whiteboard: LATTER RAIN (Joel 2) = Final Empowerment]`
-   Spirit of Prophecy Insight: *Acts of the Apostles*, p. 52 - Acknowledges mystery but stresses His necessity: "The nature of the Holy Spirit is a mystery... Yet the operations of the Spirit are essential to the salvation of man."
-   [Aside: "Seeking the Spirit isn't about seeking ecstatic experiences, but seeking the Divine Person who alone can change our hearts and empower us to reflect Jesus fully, preparing us for His return."]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   The Promise: Jesus promised Him as our Comforter and Guide (John 14:16).
-   The Father's Desire: God longs to give us His Spirit (Luke 11:13). `[Whiteboard: God WANTS to Give the Spirit (Luke 11:13)]`
-   Our Condition: Recognize our deep need. **(RQ)** Have we truly sought His fullness, or have we tried to live on our own strength?
-   Call to Action:
    -   Repent of grieving or neglecting Him (Eph 4:30).
    -   Earnestly pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, for the 'latter rain' experience (Acts 1:5, 8; Zech 10:1).
    -   Surrender daily to His leading and transforming power.
-   Final Thought: He is God dwelling with us and in us, the indispensable key to finishing the work of character development in us, and the work of the gospel through us.
