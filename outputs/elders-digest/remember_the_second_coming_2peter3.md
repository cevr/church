  implications for us today.
- [Write on board: 2 Peter 3 - Remember the Promise]

### The Scoffers' Argument (2 Peter 3:3-4) (7 min)

- **Peter's Warning (v. 3):**
  - "Knowing this first..." - A key understanding for the last days.
  - Scoffers _will_ come. Prophecy fulfilled.
  - Their Motivation: "...walking after their own lusts." Lifestyle influences
    belief.
- **The Scoffing Question (v. 4a):**
  - "Where is the promise of his coming?" - Direct challenge to core Christian
    hope.
  - **(RQ)** Do we hear echoes of this skepticism today, even subtly?
- **The 'Evidence' (v. 4b):**
  - Argument from Uniformity: "...since the fathers fell asleep, all things
    continue as they were from the beginning of the creation."
  - Based on limited human observation and ignoring divine action.
  - [Write on board: Scoffers' Claim (v.4): "All things continue as they were"]

### God's Answer: Past Judgment & Future Promise (2 Peter 3:5-7) (10 min)

- **Willful Ignorance (v. 5a):**
  - "For this they willingly are ignorant of..." - A choice to forget/ignore
    God's power.
- **Counter-Evidence 1: Creation (v. 5b):**
  - "...by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out
    of the water and in the water:"
  - The world exists by God's command, not by chance or inherent stability.
  - [Write on board: God's Word: 1. Created (v.5)]
- **Counter-Evidence 2: The Flood (v. 6):**
  - "Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:"
  - Historical Proof: Things _have not_ always continued! God _has_ intervened
    decisively.
  - [Write on board: God's Word: 2. Judged (Flood - v.6)]
  - [Analogy (from v.6): Like ignoring documented tsunami history while living
    on the coast because the sea is calm *today*.]
- **Counter-Evidence 3: Future Judgment (v. 7):**
  - "But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in
    store, reserved unto fire..."
  - The same divine Word guarantees future judgment.
  - [Write on board: God's Word: 3. Reserves for Fire (v.7)]
  - Key Point: God's Word, not apparent natural consistency, is the ultimate
    reality and guarantee.

### God's Timing & Patience (2 Peter 3:8-9) [*] (8 min)

- **A Different Perspective on Time (v. 8):**
  - "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing... one day is with the Lord
    as a thousand years..."
  - God is eternal, not bound by our perception of time.
  - **(RQ)** How does remembering God's eternal perspective help us when His
    return seems delayed?
  - [Write on board: God's Time ≠ Our Time (v.8)]
- **The Reason for the 'Delay' (v. 9 - Central Verse):**
  - Not "slackness" (neglect or inability) as scoffers imply.
  - It is "longsuffering to us-ward" - Divine Patience.
  - [Write on board: Delay = God's Patience (v.9)]
- **God's Ultimate Desire (v. 9b):**
  - "...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to
    repentance."
  - The waiting period is an act of mercy, extending the opportunity for
    salvation.
  - [Write on board: Patience -> Opportunity for Repentance (v.9)]
  - [Aside: It's profound – the very time scoffers use to doubt God's promise is
    actually a demonstration of His incredible mercy, described right here in
    verse 9. He's holding back the end, not out of weakness, but out of love,
    giving *everyone* more time to choose Him.]

### The Certainty & Nature of His Coming (2 Peter 3:10) (5 min)

- **Absolute Certainty (v. 10a):**
  - "But the day of the Lord _will_ come..." - A divine guarantee.
- **Sudden & Unexpected (v. 10a):**
  - "...as a thief in the night..." - Not secret, but sudden for the unprepared.
  - [Write on board: Coming = Certain (v.10) + Sudden ("thief")]
- **Cosmic Transformation (v. 10b):**
  - Heavens pass away, elements melt, earth judged.
  - Emphasizes the finality and awesome power of this event.
  - [Brief Mention: EGW writings vividly describe this majestic, visible return
    - cf. Great Controversy.]

### Practical Response: Holy Living & Urgency (2 Peter 3:11-14) (5 min)

- **The Inescapable Question (v. 11a):**
  - "Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of
    persons ought ye to be...?"
  - **(RQ)** If this future is certain, how should it impact our present?
- **The Required Character (v. 11b):**
  - "...in all holy conversation [conduct] and godliness,"
  - Our lives should align with our hope.
  - [Write on board: Response (v.11): Holy Conduct & Godliness]
- **The Believer's Attitude (v. 12):**
  - "Looking for and hasting unto the coming..." - Eager expectation, living in
    readiness.
- **The Ultimate Hope (v. 13):**
  - New heavens and new earth, where righteousness dwells.
- **The Call to Diligence (v. 14):**
  - "...be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and
    blameless."
  - Requires conscious effort, enabled by His grace.
  - [Write on board: Goal (v.14): Found in Peace, Spotless]
  - Action Step (derived from v.11, 14): This week, identify one daily habit.
    Ask: Does this reflect 'godliness' and help prepare me to be found 'in
    peace'? Pray for diligence.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** Peter confronts skepticism (v.3-4) with God's past actions
  (v.5-7) and future promises (v.7, 10). The perceived delay is God's patient
  call to repentance (v.8-9).
- **Reiterate Central Truth (v. 9):** God's patience is active, purposeful
  mercy, offering _us_ time.
- **Urgency:** The 'thief' analogy (v.10) demands present readiness. We don't
  know the hour.
- **Final Thought:** Don't misinterpret God's longsuffering. It's an invitation.
- **Appeal:** Heed Peter's call (v.11, 14). Embrace God's patience by turning to
  Him in repentance and faith. Seek His grace to live in holiness, diligently
  preparing to meet Him in peace. Choose readiness today.
