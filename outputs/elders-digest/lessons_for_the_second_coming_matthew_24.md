### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: World events shout uncertainty. Where does the Bible direct our focus? **(RQ)**
-   Context: Jesus' Olivet Discourse (Matt 24) - Disciples' crucial questions (v. 3).
-   Relevance: Not just abstract doctrine, but preparation for history's climax.
-   Overview: Exploring Christ's own words – Certainty, Signs, and Our Response.
-   [Whiteboard: Matthew 24 - Christ's Own Words on His Return]

### Section 1: The Certainty & Nature of His Coming (10 min)

#### A. It IS Happening: Christ's Unshakeable Promise
-   Foundation Text: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away." (Matt 24:35)
-   [Whiteboard: Certainty = Christ's Unfailing Word (Matt 24:35)]
-   Contrast: Worldly skepticism vs. Divine Assurance. **(RQ)** How deeply do we trust His word alone for this hope?

#### B. How He Comes: Literal, Visible, Glorious
-   Key Texts: 
    -   "Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear... they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds..." (Matt 24:30)
    -   "...with power and great glory. And He will send His angels... gather together His elect..." (Matt 24:31)
-   [Whiteboard: Visible (v.30) + Audible Trumpet (v.31) + Global Gathering]
-   Clarification: Affirms historic Adventist understanding; refutes secret rapture/purely spiritual coming.
-   [Illustration Concept (from Matt 24:27): Like lightning - sudden, undeniable, universally visible.]

### Section 2: Signs of Nearness & Suddenness (12 min) [*]

#### A. Recognizing the Season: The Fig Tree Parable
-   Key Text: "Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near." (Matt 24:32)
-   Application: "So you also, when you see all these things [signs listed earlier in Matt 24], know that it is near—at the doors!" (Matt 24:33)
-   [Whiteboard: Fig Tree (vv. 32-33) -> Convergence of Signs -> Know it is NEAR]
-   Focus: Not date-setting, but discerning the 'season' of His return through biblical signs.
-   **(RQ)** Are we actively observing the signs Christ gave, recognizing the lateness of the hour?

#### B. Unexpected Arrival: The Days of Noah
-   Key Text: "But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be." (Matt 24:37)
-   Description: "...eating and drinking, marrying... until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came..." (Matt 24:38-39)
-   [Whiteboard: Noah (vv. 37-39) -> World Preoccupied + Unbelief -> Sudden Arrival]
-   Lesson: Danger of spiritual apathy and being absorbed by worldly cares, ignoring warnings.
-   [Aside: "Just as Noah built the ark amidst ridicule, our preparation often involves choices counter-cultural to the world around us. Faithfulness looks foolish until the 'rain' starts."]

### Section 3: The Divine Timing & Our Response (12 min)

#### A. The Unknown Hour: God's Prerogative
-   Key Texts:
    -   "But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only." (Matt 24:36)
    -   "Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming." (Matt 24:42)
-   [Whiteboard: Matt 24:36 -> Time Unknown -> Rejects Date-Setting -> Fuels Watchfulness]
-   Purpose: Fosters constant dependence, prevents fanaticism, necessitates perpetual readiness.

#### B. God's Perspective on "Soon": Patience & Purpose
-   Supporting Text: 2 Peter 3:8-9 ("...with the Lord one day is as a thousand years... The Lord is not slack concerning His promise... but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish...")
-   [Whiteboard: 2 Peter 3:8-9 -> God's Time ≠ Our Time; His Purpose = Salvation]
-   **(RQ)** How does God's longsuffering perspective (2 Pet 3:9) reframe our understanding of 'soon' and fuel our mission rather than complacency?
-   [Aside: "Our impatience with 'soon' often reflects a self-centered view. God's 'soon' encompasses His vast, merciful plan to gather all who will respond. His timing is always perfect for His ultimate purpose."]

#### C. The Essential Response: Be Ready!
-   Central Command: "Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." (Matt 24:44)
-   [Whiteboard: Central Command: BE READY! (Matt 24:44)]
-   **The Need/Question (from text):** Since He comes unexpectedly (v.44), how do we ensure we are not caught unprepared like those in Noah's day (v.39)?
-   **The Biblical Principle (from text):** Readiness = Watchfulness (v.42) + Faithfulness (demonstrated by the wise servant, vv. 45-47).
-   **Bridging to Practice (linking text):** Readiness isn't passive waiting; it's active, daily faithfulness reflecting the character of Christ. **(RQ)** What does 'watching' (v.42) practically involve beyond just looking at signs?
-   **Actionable Steps (derived from passage):**
    *   1. Spiritual Alertness: Daily connection with God through prayer & study (Implied by 'watching').
    *   2. Faithful Service: Actively doing God's assigned work (Matt 24:45-46 - giving 'food in due season').
    *   3. Character Readiness: Living in moment-by-moment alignment with His will (Implied by 'be ready').
    *   [Whiteboard: Readiness = Watch (Alertness) + Work (Faithfulness) + Walk (Obedience)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

-   Summary Recap: Christ IS coming (Certainty - v.35), signs show it's NEAR (Fig Tree - v.32), it will be SUDDEN (Noah - v.37), the time is UNKNOWN (v.36), so our constant state must be READINESS (v.44).
-   Simplicity Revealed: Matthew 24 isn't primarily about complex charts, but a clear, urgent call from Jesus to relationship and preparation.
-   Final Thought: True readiness is about *who we are becoming* in Christ *today*.
-   Invitation: Let's commit to daily readiness – watching spiritually, working faithfully, walking obediently. Prepare to meet Him with joy, not fear.
-   Closing Prayer.
