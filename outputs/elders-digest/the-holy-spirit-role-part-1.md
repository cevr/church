### Introduction (5 min)

*   Hook: The profound mystery - God becoming man (John 1:14). How did divinity operate within humanity?
*   Topic Intro: Focus not just *that* Jesus lived perfectly, but *how* – through the essential, moment-by-moment agency of the Holy Spirit.
*   Central Question: What power source did Jesus rely on in His humanity to live sinlessly and fulfill His mission? **(RQ)**
*   Aim: To see Christ's dependence on the Spirit as the divine pattern for *our* lives.
*   [Whiteboard: Title & Acts 10:38 - "Anointed with the Holy Ghost and with Power"] 

### Section 1: Conception & Birth - Spirit's Initiation (7 min)

*   Point: Jesus' human existence began through the Holy Spirit's direct action.
*   Scripture: Matthew 1:18 - "...she was found with child of the Holy Ghost."
*   Scripture: Matthew 1:20 - "...that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost."
*   Explanation: From the very start, His humanity was intertwined with and dependent upon the Spirit's power. Not inherent divine power operating independently *in* the flesh, but the Spirit enabling the human nature.
*   [Whiteboard: Matt 1:18, 20 --> Conceived by the Holy Spirit = Initial Dependence]
*   Connection: This establishes the foundation – His life wasn't self-powered divinity in disguise, but true humanity empowered by God's Spirit. **(RQ)** Does this change how we view Christ's temptations and struggles?

### Section 2: Baptism - Spirit's Anointing for Mission (9 min) [*]

*   Point: The public endowment of the Spirit for His Messianic work.
*   Scripture: John 1:32-33 - John testifies, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him... the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost."
*   Explanation: This wasn't Jesus *receiving* divinity, but His humanity being fully equipped and affirmed by the Father through the Spirit for the specific task ahead. (cf. John 3:34 - Spirit given "not by measure").
*   [Whiteboard: John 1:32-33 --> Spirit Descends = Anointing/Equipping for Mission]
*   Scripture: Acts 10:38 - Revisit Central Verse. Connect the anointing directly to His power and actions.
*   Explanation: The anointing wasn't passive; it was the source of His active power to overcome evil and "do good."
*   [Whiteboard: Acts 10:38 --> Anointing (Spirit) -> Power -> Doing Good]
*   [Aside: Like a craftsman receiving the finest tools specifically suited for a masterpiece, Jesus' humanity was fully equipped by the Spirit at baptism for the work of redemption.]

### Section 3: Ministry - Spirit's Constant Leading & Power (11 min)

*   Point: Jesus lived in continuous reliance on the Spirit's guidance and sustaining strength.
*   Scripture: Mark 1:12 - "And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness."
*   Explanation: The Spirit wasn't just for 'good moments'; He directed Jesus even into places of severe testing. Submission to the Spirit's leading was key.
*   [Whiteboard: Mark 1:12 --> Spirit LEADS (even into trial)]
*   Scripture: Luke 4:1 - "And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness..."
*   Explanation: Emphasizes the *fullness* of the Spirit as the prerequisite for facing temptation successfully. His strength wasn't His own human will alone.
*   [Whiteboard: Luke 4:1 --> FULL of the Spirit = Strength in Temptation]
*   Theological Link (EGW): This aligns with the understanding that the Spirit imparts Christ's own attributes (DA 805). It was *how* He manifested divine character in human flesh.
*   [Write Concept: Spirit -> Imparts Christ's Attributes (DA 805)]
*   **(RQ)** If Jesus, being divine, still needed to be *full* of the Spirit to overcome, what does that say about our need?

### Section 4: Our Model - Spirit's Availability & Application (8 min)

*   Point: Christ's Spirit-dependent life is not just admirable, it's the *pattern* and *promise* for us.
*   Theological Link (EGW): The same Spirit given "without measure" to Christ is available to us upon full surrender (MB 21).
*   [Write Concept: Christ (Spirit w/o measure) = Our Potential (MB 21) IF Surrendered]
*   Implication (Character Perfection/Last Gen): This isn't about self-effort, but accessing the *same divine power* Christ used. This makes reflecting His character a genuine possibility.
*   [Draw: Christ's Dependence (Acts 10:38) --> Our Surrender (MB 21) --> Spirit's Fullness (Luke 11:13) --> Character Likeness]
*   Scripture: Luke 11:13 - "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
*   Practical Steps (Derived from Texts):
    *   1. Acknowledge Dependence: Consciously recognize daily, hourly, that like Christ in His humanity, we can do nothing of ourselves (cf. John 5:30). `[Link to Luke 4:1 - Need for fullness]`
    *   2. Ask Persistently: Make seeking the Holy Spirit's fullness a primary, specific prayer focus (Luke 11:13). `[Whiteboard: Action 1: ASK Daily (Luke 11:13)]`
    *   3. Surrender Actively: Practice yielding decisions, reactions, plans to His guidance, just as Christ was led (Mark 1:12). `[Whiteboard: Action 2: YIELD Will (Mark 1:12)]`
    *   4. Expect Empowerment: Believe and act on the faith that the Spirit *will* empower righteous living ("doing good") as He did for Jesus (Acts 10:38). `[Whiteboard: Action 3: EXPECT Power (Acts 10:38)]`
*   [Aside: We often think of the Spirit helping us *after* we sin, but the greater promise, seen in Christ, is the Spirit's power to keep us *from* sinning and empower us *for* righteousness.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

*   Summary: Jesus Christ, in His humanity, lived a life utterly dependent on the Holy Spirit – from conception, through baptismal anointing, to daily ministry and temptation.
*   Reiterate Model: His perfect life wasn't an unattainable display of divinity, but a demonstration of what God's Spirit can do in fully surrendered humanity.
*   Significance: This is the key to understanding Character Perfection and the hope of the Last Generation – accessing the same divine power.
*   Appeal: Will you stop relying on your own strength? Will you commit today to consciously, persistently asking for and yielding to the Holy Spirit, believing He can empower you as He empowered Christ? (Luke 11:13). Let's pray for that specific infilling now.
