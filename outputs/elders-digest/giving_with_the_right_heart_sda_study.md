### Introduction (6 min)

-   Hook: Why do we talk about giving money/resources to God? Does He *need* it? **(RQ)**

    -   He owns everything (Ps 50:10-12). [Whiteboard: Ps 50:10-12 - God Owns All]
    -   He isn't dependent on human offerings (Ps 50:13; Acts 17:25).
-   Our Position: Stewards, not Owners (1 Chron 29:14).
    -   Everything originates from Him. [Whiteboard: 1 Chron 29:14 - All from God]
-   Central Theme: Giving isn't about meeting God's need, but about our heart's response to Him.
-   Introduce Central Verse: 2 Cor 9:7 - The focus is the *heart* behind the gift.
    -   [Whiteboard: Title + 2 Cor 9:7]

### Main Content Section 1: God Needs Nothing, We Need to Give (10 min)

-   **Exploring God's Perspective (Psalm 50:7-14):**
    -   God isn't rebuking Israel for *lack* of sacrifices (v. 8), but their *understanding*.
    -   He emphasizes His ownership (vv. 10-12) - He doesn't need their animals for food.
    -   What He *desires*: Thanksgiving (v. 14), fulfilling vows (v. 14), calling on Him (v. 15).
    -   [Whiteboard: Ps 50 - God Wants: Thanksgiving, Faithfulness, Prayer]
    -   (RQ) If God owns it all, what does our act of 'giving' truly signify?
-   **Our True Relationship to Possessions (1 Chron 29:14):**
    -   David's prayer: Acknowledging God as the source of *everything*.
    -   "Of thine own have we given thee." - Giving is returning a portion of His blessings.
    -   This perspective fosters humility and gratitude, not pride.
    -   (RQ) How does viewing ourselves as stewards, not owners, change how we approach giving?

### Main Content Section 2: Right Motives vs. Wrong Motives (12 min) [*]

-   **Contrasting Unacceptable Motives:**
    -   Mere Obligation/Duty (Implied contrast to 'cheerful' - Mal 1:13 'what a weariness').
    -   Guilt or Coercion ('of necessity' - 2 Cor 9:7).
    -   Trying to Earn Favor / Thinking God is Dependent (Acts 17:25; Ps 50:9).
    -   [Whiteboard: WRONG MOTIVES: Duty Only, Guilt, Coercion, Earning Favor]
-   **Cultivating God-Honoring Motives (from Scripture):**
    -   **1. Thankfulness (Ps 50:14, 23):**
        -   Giving as a direct expression of gratitude for salvation, blessings, answered prayer.
        -   It's worship ('Offer unto God thanksgiving'). [Whiteboard: MOTIVE 1: Thankfulness (Ps 50:14)]
        -   (RQ) How can we make our giving a more conscious act of thankfulness?
    -   **2. Generosity (2 Cor 9:6):**
        -   Principle: Sow sparingly -> Reap sparingly; Sow bountifully -> Reap bountifully.
        -   Reflects God's own generous nature towards us.
        -   [Analogy (from 2 Cor 9:6): Farmer's planting - investment determines return. Applies spiritually.]
        -   [Whiteboard: MOTIVE 2: Generosity (2 Cor 9:6)]
    -   **3. Purposefulness / Intentionality (2 Cor 9:7a):**
        -   'According as he purposeth in his heart' - Planned, decided giving.
        -   Not an afterthought or based on fluctuating emotions.
        -   Requires prayerful consideration. [Whiteboard: MOTIVE 3: Purposefulness (2 Cor 9:7a)]
    -   **4. Joyfulness / Cheerfulness (2 Cor 9:7b):**
        -   'God loveth a cheerful giver' (Greek: *hilaros* - hilarious, joyful).
        -   Giving from a happy, willing heart, delighting in partnership with God.
        -   (RQ) What hinders joyful giving, and how can we cultivate it? [Whiteboard: MOTIVE 4: Joyfulness (2 Cor 9:7b)]
    -   [Aside: Giving motivated by love transforms it from a mere duty into a delightful expression of our relationship with the Giver of all gifts. It's less about the amount and more about the heart's attitude.]

### Main Content Section 3: Giving, the Heart, and God's Provision (11 min)

-   **The Ultimate Diagnostic Tool (Matt 6:21):**
    -   "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
    -   Our spending and giving patterns reveal our true priorities and affections.
    -   [Whiteboard: Matt 6:21 -> Treasure Location = Heart Location]
    -   (RQ) If someone examined our 'treasure map' (bank account, time usage), where would they conclude our heart is?
-   **Giving and Character Development:**
    -   Right giving combats selfishness and materialism.
    -   It cultivates trust in God, gratitude, and generosity – reflections of Christ's character.
    -   It's practical sanctification – aligning our actions (stewardship) with our faith.
-   **God's Promise of Provision (2 Cor 9:8):**
    -   God is *able* to make *all grace* abound.
    -   Purpose: That we, *always having all sufficiency in all things*, may *abound to every good work* (including giving).
    -   God provides *so that* we can be generous.
    -   [Whiteboard: 2 Cor 9:8 -> God's Provision -> Our Sufficiency -> Ability to Give Generously]
    -   Trusting this promise overcomes fear in giving.
    -   [Aside: It's like God gives us seed to sow (2 Cor 9:10). Some is for our bread, but much is entrusted to us to plant generously for His kingdom, knowing He'll supply more seed.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** God desires our hearts, expressed through giving motivated by Thankfulness, Generosity, Purpose, and Joy (2 Cor 9:7).
-   Giving isn't about meeting God's needs (Ps 50) but reflects our stewardship (1 Chron 29:14) and heart condition (Matt 6:21).
-   Trust God's promise to provide as we give generously (2 Cor 9:8).
-   **Practical Application & Self-Reflection:**
    -   **Examine:** Prayerfully consider your *primary* motives for giving. Ask God for honesty. **(RQ)**
    -   **Action Step 1 (Thankfulness):** This week, identify one specific blessing and give an offering (time, talent, money) explicitly thanking God for it. [Link to Ps 50:14]
    -   **Action Step 2 (Purposefulness):** Review your giving. Is it planned? Decide prayerfully *beforehand* what you purpose to give. [Link to 2 Cor 9:7a]
    -   **Action Step 3 (Joy/Generosity):** Ask God to replace any reluctance with His joy and generosity. Pray for opportunities to sow bountifully. [Link to 2 Cor 9:6-7b]
-   **Final Invitation:** Embrace giving not as a burden, but as a joyful act of worship, a partnership with God, and a means of growing in His grace and reflecting His character. Let your giving declare where your heart truly lies.
