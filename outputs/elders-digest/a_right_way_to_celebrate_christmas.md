### Introduction (5 min)

*   Welcome & Opening Prayer
*   The World's Christmas vs. God's Intent: Frenzy vs. Focus.
*   **Central Question:** How did those who first encountered the Christ-child respond? What does this teach *us* about a right celebration? **(RQ)**
*   Introduce Central Verse (Luke 2:10-11): Good news, great joy, a Saviour. This is the *reason* for the season.
*   [Write on board: CHRISTMAS = Celebrating Christ the Lord (Luke 2:11)]
*   Transition: Let's examine the biblical responses to His birth to find our pattern.

### Section 1: Worship & Giving - The Wise Men's Response (8 min)

*   **Biblical Basis:** Matthew 2:10-11
    *   "When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy." (v. 10)
    *   "And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh." (v. 11)
*   **The Need/Question:** How do we truly honor a King, especially the King of Kings? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle:** True celebration involves recognizing Christ's royalty and divinity (Matt 2:11), leading to joyful worship ("fell down, and worshipped") and sacrificial giving ("opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts").
    *   [Write on board: Matt 2:11 -> Worship (Heart) + Gifts (Substance)]
*   **Bridging to Practice:** Their gifts were costly and symbolic. What "treasures" can we offer Christ today – not just money, but our time, talents, our very hearts?
*   **Illustration:** Think of presenting a gift to earthly royalty. It wouldn't be casual; it would be thoughtful, valuable, representing respect. The Wise Men's gifts weren't random trinkets; they were deeply symbolic of Christ's identity (Gold=King, Frankincense=Priest/God, Myrrh=Sacrifice). Our worship and gifts should reflect His supreme worth.
*   `[Aside: Some traditions suggest the Wise Men arrived much later than the shepherds, perhaps when Jesus was a toddler (Matt 2:11 mentions a "house," not a manger). The core point remains their intentional response to the King.]`

### Section 2: Joy & Praise - The Angelic Announcement & Shepherd Response (7 min)

*   **Biblical Basis:** Luke 2:10-11 (Angels' message), Luke 2:20 (Shepherds' response)
    *   "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born...a Saviour..." (vv. 10-11)
    *   "And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen..." (v. 20)
*   **The Need/Question:** What is the *source* of true Christmas joy? Is it just feelings, or something deeper? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle:** The announcement of the Saviour, Christ the Lord, is the foundation of "good tidings of great joy" (Luke 2:10-11). Experiencing this truth naturally overflows into praise and glorifying God (Luke 2:20).
    *   [Write on board: Saviour Born (Luke 2:11) -> Great Joy (Luke 2:10) -> Praise God (Luke 2:20)]
*   **Bridging:** Our joy isn't ultimately based on circumstances or presents, but on the *fact* of the Saviour's birth and what He came to do for "all people" (Luke 2:10). This objective truth fuels subjective praise.

### Section 3: Reflection & Pondering - Mary's Response [*] (7 min)

*   **Biblical Basis:** Luke 2:19
    *   "But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart."
*   **The Need/Question:** In the midst of busy celebrations and amazing events, how do we process their true meaning? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle:** True understanding and internalizing of God's work often requires quiet reflection ("kept all these things") and deep consideration ("pondered them in her heart").
    *   [Write on board: Luke 2:19 -> Pondering = Deep Reflection on God's Acts]
*   **Bridging:** Amidst the Christmas rush (parties, shopping, cooking), do we intentionally pause, like Mary, to quietly consider *what* God has done in sending His Son and what it means personally? This prevents the sacred from becoming merely superficial. [*]

### Section 4: Evangelism & Sharing - The Shepherds' Action (7 min)

*   **Biblical Basis:** Luke 2:17
    *   "And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child."
*   **The Need/Question:** When we experience something truly amazing, especially life-changing good news, what is the natural response? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle:** Encountering Christ and understanding the "good tidings" (Luke 2:10) compels sharing that news with others (Luke 2:17). The shepherds couldn't keep it to themselves.
    *   [Write on board: See Christ -> Share Christ (Luke 2:17)]
*   **Bridging:** Our celebration isn't just personal; it includes sharing the "good tidings of great joy" (Luke 2:10) with those around us who may not know the Saviour. It's a natural outflow of genuine experience.
*   **Illustration:** Imagine finding the only source of pure water in a desert. Would you keep it secret while others thirsted? The shepherds had news far greater – the source of living water, the Saviour! Sharing was the only loving response.

### Section 5: Obedience & Trust - Mary & Joseph's Foundation (6 min)

*   **Biblical Basis:** Luke 1:38 (Mary: "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word."), Matthew 1:24 (Joseph: "...did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him...")
*   **The Need/Question:** How should we respond when God's plan interrupts our own or asks something difficult and counter-cultural? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle:** Faith in God involves trusting His word and obeying His commands (Luke 1:38, Matt 1:24), even when it requires personal sacrifice, challenges our understanding, or invites societal disapproval.
    *   [Write on board: God Speaks -> Faith -> Obedience (Luke 1:38, Matt 1:24)]
*   **Bridging:** True celebration involves aligning our will with God's. Are we willing to obey His leading in our lives, even when inconvenient or costly, as Mary and Joseph did? Their obedience paved the way for the Saviour's arrival.
*   `[Aside: Notice the personal cost for both Mary (social stigma) and Joseph (potential divorce, public shame). Their obedience wasn't easy or based on full understanding, highlighting the depth of their trust in God's character and command.]`

### Conclusion & Practical Application (5 min)

*   **Recap Need/Question:** We asked how to celebrate Christmas rightly, looking to the first witnesses. The world offers frenzy; God's Word offers focus.
*   **Recap Biblical Principle:** The biblical response to Christ's birth isn't passive observation but active engagement: Joyful Worship & Sacrificial Giving (Wise Men - Matt 2:11), Praise rooted in the Saviour's identity (Shepherds/Angels - Luke 2:10-11, 20), Quiet Reflection to internalize truth (Mary - Luke 2:19), Eager Sharing of the Good News (Shepherds - Luke 2:17), and Foundational Trusting Obedience (Mary/Joseph - Luke 1:38, Matt 1:24). It's all about responding *to Him*.
*   **Bridging:** These aren't just historical accounts; they are divine models for our own response to Christ, not just at Christmas, but every day. How can we shift our celebration from cultural habits to Christ-centered actions based on Scripture?
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
    1.  **Worship Intentionally:** This week, set aside specific time (even 15 min) to consciously worship Christ. Read Luke 2:1-20 or Matt 1-2, pray, and offer Him the "gift" of your focused attention and praise (cf. Matt 2:11, Luke 2:20).
    2.  **Share Simply:** Identify one person you can share *why* Jesus' birth is "good tidings" with – perhaps simply explaining He is the Saviour (Luke 2:11). Pray for an opportunity (cf. Luke 2:17).
    3.  **Reflect Quietly:** Before Christmas Day, schedule 10-15 minutes away from the noise. Like Mary, ponder: "What does Jesus being born *personally* mean for my life, my sin, my future?" (cf. Luke 2:19).
*   **Invitation:** This Christmas, let's move beyond just tradition. Will you choose to respond to the King with intentional worship, joyful sharing, quiet reflection, and trusting obedience, making *Him* the true center of your celebration, as revealed in His Word?
