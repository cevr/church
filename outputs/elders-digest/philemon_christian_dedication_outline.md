### Introduction (5-7 min)
- Hook: Imagine a difficult situation needing reconciliation. How does the Gospel guide us? **(RQ)**
- Brief Context: Paul (prisoner), Philemon (Colossian believer), Onesimus (runaway slave, converted by Paul).
- Overview: This personal letter is a powerful demonstration of Christian grace, forgiveness, and restoration in action.
- [Write on board: Philemon - A Living Letter on Forgiveness & Restoration]
- Central Theme: The Gospel transforms relationships (Philemon 1:15-16).

### Main Content Section 1: The Foundation of Fellowship (Philemon 1:1-7) (10 min)
- Paul's Greeting (v. 1-3): Prisoner *for* Christ, identifying with fellow labourers (Philemon, Apphia, Archippus), wishing grace & peace.
    - [Whiteboard: Paul (Prisoner), Philemon (Partner), Apphia (Sister), Archippus (Soldier) = Church Family]
- Paul's Thanksgiving & Prayer (v. 4-6): Commends Philemon's love and faith toward Christ *and* the saints.
    - Key: Faith (vertical) and Love (horizontal) are visible, active (v. 5).
    - Prayer Goal: Sharing (koinonia) of faith becomes *effectual* (energes) through acknowledging every good thing *in you in Christ Jesus* (v. 6).
    - [Whiteboard: Faith (toward Christ) + Love (toward Saints) = Effectual Witness (v. 6)]
    - How does recognizing God's work *in us* empower our witness? **(RQ)** (Focuses on God's power, not self).
- Joy & Consolation (v. 7): Philemon's love refreshes the hearts ("bowels") of the saints.
    - Practical love brings tangible encouragement and unity.
    - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]

### Main Content Section 2: The Appeal Born of Love (Philemon 1:8-16) (12 min) [*]
- Paul's Gentle Approach (v. 8-9): Could command based on apostleship, but appeals based on love and shared identity in Christ ("Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner").
    - Authority exercised with grace and humility.
- The Subject: Onesimus (v. 10): "My son, whom I have begotten in my bonds."
    - Spiritual transformation and relationship forged in adversity.
- The Transformation (v. 11): Once "unprofitable" (achrestos), now "profitable" (euchrestos) to both Philemon and Paul.
    - [Whiteboard: Onesimus: Unprofitable (Useless/Harmful - v. 11a) -> Profitable (Useful/Beneficial - v. 11b) - *Cite v. 11*]
    - This is the practical result of genuine conversion! The Gospel changes character and makes one useful for God's kingdom.
    - What does "profitable" service look like in our lives today, based on this transformation? **(RQ)**
- Paul's Sacrifice & Respect (v. 12-14): Sends Onesimus back, valuing Philemon's voluntary participation ("without thy mind would I do nothing").
- Divine Providence? (v. 15): "Perhaps he departed for a season..." Suggests God can overrule human failings for a greater purpose (eternal relationship).
- The New Relationship (v. 16): "Not now as a servant [doulos], but above a servant, a brother beloved..."
    - [Whiteboard: Slave -> Brother Beloved (v. 16) - Equality in Christ]
    - The Gospel radically redefines relationships, breaking down social and economic barriers within the family of God. How must this truth shape our church community? **(RQ)**

### Main Content Section 3: The Cost and Blessing of Restoration (Philemon 1:17-22) (12 min)
- Receive Him as Myself (v. 17): The heart of the appeal. True partnership (koinonos) in the Gospel requires accepting the restored brother as one would accept Paul.
    - [Whiteboard: Receive Onesimus = Receive Paul (v. 17) - Partnership Test]
    - This reflects how Christ receives us (cf. Romans 15:7). Our acceptance of others demonstrates our understanding of God's acceptance of us.
- Taking the Debt (v. 18-19): "If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account... I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it."
    - Paul models substitutionary intercession, willing to bear the cost of Onesimus' past wrongs.
    - [Analogy (from v. 18-19): Paul acts as a type of Christ, taking Onesimus' debt upon himself.]
    - Gentle Reminder: Philemon owes Paul his "own self also" (v. 19b) – likely referring to his conversion through Paul's ministry. Grace received should motivate grace extended.
- The Desired Outcome: Refreshment (v. 20): "Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels [heart/affections] in the Lord."
    - Philemon's act of forgiveness and restoration brings joy to Paul and honors the Lord.
    - [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed.]
- Confidence & Expectation (v. 21): Paul trusts Philemon's character, expecting he will do *even more* than asked. This shows a high view of the transformative power of grace in a believer's life.
- Preparation & Fellowship (v. 22): Paul anticipates visiting, reinforcing the personal relationship and accountability.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6-8 min)
- Summary: Philemon is a living illustration that the Gospel is not mere theory; it powerfully transforms individuals (Onesimus from unprofitable to profitable) and revolutionizes relationships (master/slave to brothers in Christ).
- Key Takeaways:
    - Christian fellowship is built on active love and faith (v. 5-7).
    - Genuine conversion results in practical usefulness for God's kingdom (v. 11).
    - In Christ, worldly distinctions are superseded by our identity as beloved brothers and sisters (v. 16).
    - Forgiveness and restoration often require personal cost, reflecting Christ's sacrifice for us (v. 17-19).
- Personal Application:
    - Is there someone God is prompting you to forgive or seek reconciliation with? **(RQ)** (cf. Matt 18:21-35)
    - How can you actively promote the principle of equality and brotherhood/sisterhood within your church family, based on Philemon 1:16? **(RQ)**
    - Are you living a "profitable" life, demonstrating the transforming power of the Gospel through your character and actions? **(RQ)**
    - [Whiteboard: Action Steps: 1. Pray for grace to forgive as Christ forgave (Eph 4:32). 2. Initiate reconciliation where appropriate (Matt 5:23-24). 3. Seek to be 'profitable' in service to Christ and others.]
- Final Appeal: Let the profound grace we have received from God through Christ compel us to extend that same grace, forgiveness, and restorative love within His church. May our faith work through love (Gal 5:6), refreshing the hearts of the saints and bringing glory to God.
- Closing Prayer: Ask for God's Spirit to empower forgiveness, heal broken relationships, and make us profitable servants and loving brethren.
