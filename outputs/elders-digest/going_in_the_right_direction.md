### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Feeling lost? Searching for direction, meaning, or solid truth in a confusing world?
-   Universal quest: Humanity seeks purpose, answers, a reliable path.
-   **The Need/Question:** Where can we find absolute direction, unchanging truth, and truly meaningful life? **(RQ)**
-   Introduce Jesus' profound claim in John 14:6 as the definitive answer.
-   [Whiteboard: Write Question: Lost? Need Direction? Truth? Life? -> John 14:6]

### Section 1: The Exclusive Way (10 min)

-   **Focus:** John 14:6a - "I am the way..."
-   **Context:** Upper Room discourse, disciples' uncertainty (John 13:36-14:5 - Thomas' question).
-   **Biblical Principle/Solution:** Jesus isn't *a* way among many; He is *the* singular, exclusive path to God.
    -   [Whiteboard: John 14:6a -> THE WAY (Singular, Exclusive)]
-   **Supporting Texts:**
    -   Acts 4:12: "Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
    -   1 Timothy 2:5: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Contrast with modern relativism ('all paths lead to God'). Jesus' claim is narrow, but it's the *only* one leading to the Father.
    -   **(RQ)** How does this biblical exclusivity challenge popular tolerance ideas? Why is this exclusivity actually good news?
-   **Actionable Steps (from John 14:6a, Acts 4:12):**
    1.  Acknowledge Jesus as the *only* way in your heart and mind.
    2.  Intentionally choose His path over appealing worldly alternatives daily.
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: 1. Acknowledge (Acts 4:12) 2. Choose Daily (John 14:6a)]

### Section 2: The Embodied Truth [*] (12 min)

-   **Focus:** John 14:6b - "...the truth..."
-   **The Need/Question:** What is truth? Is it just ideas, or something more substantial? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle/Solution:** Truth isn't merely a set of doctrines or facts; it's embodied in the Person of Jesus Christ.
    -   [Whiteboard: John 14:6b -> THE TRUTH (Person, not just Precepts)]
-   **Supporting Texts:**
    -   John 1:14: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth."
    -   John 1:17: "For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ."
    -   John 8:31-32, 36: Knowing Jesus (the Truth) brings true freedom.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** We don't just learn *about* truth; we enter a relationship *with* Truth Himself.
    -   [Analogy (from John 1:14): Truth isn't just a map (doctrine); it's the living Guide (Jesus) who walks with us.]
    -   **(RQ)** How does relating to Jesus as Truth change how we read the Bible or understand doctrine?
-   **[Aside: Like spiritual embassies...]** *Our lives, centered on Christ the Truth, become outposts of Heaven's reality in a world of deception. They represent the Kingdom's principles, not just blending in with surrounding culture.*
-   **Actionable Steps (from John 1:14, 8:32):**
    1.  Seek to know Jesus personally through prayer and Scripture (John 8:31-32).
    2.  Allow His life and teachings (the embodiment of truth) to define your reality.
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: 1. Know Jesus (John 8:31) 2. Define Reality by Him (John 1:14)]

### Section 3: The Source of Life (12 min)

-   **Focus:** John 14:6c - "...and the life..."
-   **The Need/Question:** What constitutes real 'life'? Is it just breathing, or something deeper? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle/Solution:** Jesus offers *Zoe* - true, spiritual, abundant, eternal life, distinct from mere biological existence (*bios*).
    -   [Whiteboard: John 14:6c -> THE LIFE (Zoe = Abundant, Eternal)]
-   **Supporting Texts:**
    -   John 10:10b: "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."
    -   John 11:25: "Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:"
    -   1 John 5:11-12: "And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life."
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Worldly pursuits offer temporary satisfaction; Jesus offers lasting, meaningful existence now and eternally.
    -   **(RQ)** How does the 'abundant life' Jesus offers (John 10:10) differ from the world's definition of a 'good life'?
-   **[Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...]** *Just as Jesus entered our world (the Life coming down), we can use temporary resources (time, money, opportunities) gained in this life to point others towards the eternal Life found only in Him. December often offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed.*
-   **Actionable Steps (from John 10:10, 1 John 5:12):**
    1.  Receive Jesus personally to receive His life (1 John 5:12).
    2.  Actively cultivate that abundant life through connection with Him (prayer, study, obedience).
    3.  Share the source of true life with others.
    -   [Whiteboard: Action: 1. Receive Jesus (1 John 5:12) 2. Cultivate Connection (John 10:10) 3. Share Life]

### Conclusion & Invitation (6 min)

-   **Recap:** Jesus' claim in John 14:6 is absolute and all-encompassing. He is the *only* Way, the *personal embodiment* of Truth, the *sole source* of eternal Life.
    -   [Point to Whiteboard: Way, Truth, Life -> All found ONLY in Jesus]
-   **The Necessary Encounter:** Reiterate John 14:6d - "no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
    -   Access to God, true direction, reality, and purpose is solely through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
-   **Connecting Back:** Finding the 'right direction' isn't about a philosophy or set of rules, but about encountering and following a Person: Jesus.
-   **Summary of Application:** To go in the right direction means:
    -   Choosing His exclusive Way daily.
    -   Living in relationship with Him as the Truth.
    -   Experiencing His abundant, eternal Life.
-   **Invitation (Gentle):** Have you personally encountered the Way, the Truth, and the Life? Is He directing your path? Today is the day to open (or re-open) your life fully to Him. Choose the right direction. Choose Jesus.
