### Introduction (5 min)

- Paint the scene: Golgotha, the suffering Savior.
- Introduce the third saying from the cross.
  - [Whiteboard: John 19:26-27 - "Woman, behold thy son... Behold thy mother!"]
- Significance: Amidst cosmic battle and personal agony, Jesus focuses on human
  need and relationship.
- Thesis: This act reveals Christ's perfect humanity, fulfillment of God's law,
  understanding of our needs, and His ultimate power to care and unite.

### Section 1: The Scene & The Command (10 min)

- **Focus: John 19:26-27**
  - Jesus sees His mother's grief.
  - He sees John, the beloved disciple.
  - The command: Mutual care established.
- **Fulfilling the Fifth Commandment:**
  - Read Exodus 20:12.
  - [Whiteboard: Exodus 20:12 - Honor Father & Mother = Divine Command]
  - Even dying, Jesus honors His mother, ensuring her temporal care.
  - Demonstrates perfect obedience and humanity.
  - (RQ) Even in ultimate agony, what priority did Jesus demonstrate? What does
    this teach about the enduring nature of the 5th commandment?
- **Practical Responsibility:**
  - Connect to 1 Timothy 5:4, 8 (Caring for one's own household).
  - Christ's example: Divine mission doesn't negate earthly duties.

### Section 2: The Cost & The Comfort [*] (12 min)

- **Mary's Suffering Foretold:**
  - Read Luke 2:34-35 (Simeon's prophecy).
  - [Whiteboard: Luke 2:35 - "A sword shall pierce through thy own soul
    also..."]
  - Mary at the cross: Prophecy fulfilled, the deep pain of discipleship.
  - (RQ) How does Mary's experience challenge a superficial view of faith that
    expects only blessings without trials?
- **Christ Understands Our Needs:**
  - He felt the weight of His mother's sorrow.
  - He understands human vulnerability and the need for care.
  - Read Hebrews 4:15-16 (High Priest touched with feelings of our infirmities).
  - [Whiteboard: Hebrews 4:15 - Touched with the feeling of our infirmities]
  - Comfort: He cares for both temporal (Mary's housing) and eternal needs
    (salvation).
  - Reference: _Desire of Ages_, p. 752 (Christ's sympathy encompasses all human
    sorrow).
  - [Aside: Like finding a coin on the groundâ€”even though earthly relationships
    and needs exist within a fallen world, Christ redirects them for kingdom
    purposes, showing care and establishing godly order.]

### Section 3: Kinship, Care & Unity (12 min)

- **Spiritual vs. Earthly Kinship:**
  - Recall Matthew 12:46-50.
  - [Whiteboard: Matt 12:50 - "Whosoever shall DO the will of my Father... the
    same is my brother, and sister, and mother."]
  - Spiritual family defined by obedience to God.
  - Yet, Jesus honors earthly ties by providing for Mary.
  - Balance: Spiritual allegiance is primary, but doesn't abolish God-ordained
    earthly responsibilities. (Ref _Desire of Ages_, p. 325 concept).
  - (RQ) How do we balance our commitment to the church family (spiritual
    kinship) with our duties to our biological families, following Christ's
    example?
- **God's Promise to the Needy:**
  - Read Psalm 68:5.
  - [Whiteboard: Psalm 68:5 - "Father of the fatherless, defender of widows..."]
    -> God's Character
  - Christ embodies this divine care for the vulnerable (Mary, now effectively a
    widow needing support).
  - Connect to James 1:27 (Pure religion includes visiting widows/fatherless).
  - [Analogy (from Ps 68:5): God acts as the ultimate guardian and provider when
    earthly supports fail, as Jesus ensured for Mary through John.]
- **Ultimate Unity in Christ:**
  - Recall John 7:5 (His brothers did not believe in Him).
  - Read Acts 1:14.
  - [Whiteboard: Acts 1:14 - Brothers praying w/ disciples & Mary] ->
    Reconciling Power
  - Christ's sacrifice and love ultimately drew His earthly family into the
    spiritual family.
  - Hope for our own families.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Summary: The third word reveals Jesus as:
  - The obedient Son (fulfilling the Law).
  - The compassionate Savior (understanding our pain).
  - The responsible Provider (caring for temporal needs).
  - The unifying Lord (drawing all into His family).
- Application:
  - Examine our fulfillment of the 5th Commandment (honoring parents, caring for
    family needs).
  - Trust Christ's understanding and care in our own sorrows and needs (Heb
    4:16).
