### Introduction (5 min)
-   Hook: The Danger of Comfort - Is spiritual 'comfort' always good? **(RQ)**
-   Context: The last of the seven churches (Rev 1-3) - a message for the end-time church.
-   Introduce Laodicea: A church with a serious problem, yet deeply loved by Christ.
-   Central Theme: Understanding Christ's diagnosis of spiritual lukewarmness and His loving remedy.
-   [Whiteboard: Laodicea (Rev 3:14-22) - Diagnosis | Remedy | Promise]

### Section 1: Christ's Authority & Diagnosis (Rev 3:14-17) (12 min)
-   **Who is Speaking? (v. 14)**
    -   "The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God."
    -   Significance: His words are final, true, authoritative. He knows the real situation.
    -   [Whiteboard: Christ's Titles (Rev 3:14) = Ultimate Authority & Truth]
-   **The Condition: Lukewarmness (v. 15-16)**
    -   "Neither cold nor hot... I will spue thee out of my mouth."
    -   Define Lukewarm: Spiritual indifference, complacency, half-heartedness, mixing worldliness with faith. [Analogy: Room temperature water - unrefreshing, unpleasant].
    -   Why is it so offensive? **(RQ)** (Useless, nauseating compromise).
    -   [Whiteboard: Lukewarm (v.15-16) = Indifference -> Rejection]
-   **The Self-Deception (v. 17)**
    -   Laodicea's Claim: "I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing."
    -   Christ's Reality: "...knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked."
    -   The danger of mistaking material/outward prosperity for spiritual health.
    -   [Whiteboard: Laodicea's View vs. Christ's View (v.17) - Self-Sufficient vs. Utterly Needy]
    -   Modern Application: How can wealth, knowledge, or position lead to Laodicean blindness today? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Christ's Loving Counsel & Remedy (Rev 3:18-19) [*] (10 min)
-   **The Divine Prescription (v. 18)**
    -   "I counsel thee to buy of me..."
        -   Gold tried in the fire: True faith working by love (Gal 5:6). [Contrast with worldly riches].
        -   White raiment: Christ's imputed righteousness (Isa 61:10). [Contrast with spiritual nakedness].
        -   Eye salve: Holy Spirit's illumination for spiritual discernment (John 16:13). [Contrast with spiritual blindness].
    -   [Whiteboard: Christ's Remedy (v.18) - Buy from HIM: Gold (Faith/Love) | Raiment (Righteousness) | Eye Salve (Discernment)]
    -   How do we 'buy' these? (Through surrender, faith, seeking Him).
-   **The Motivation: Love (v. 19)**
    -   "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten..."
    -   Correction is evidence of love, not rejection (Heb 12:6).
    -   [Aside: Like a loving parent disciplines a child heading for danger, God's rebukes aim to save us, not condemn us.]
    -   How should this change our response to conviction or trials? **(RQ)**
-   **The Call to Action (v. 19b)**
    -   "...be zealous therefore, and repent."
    -   Response to His love and counsel: Earnestness, turning away from complacency.

### Section 3: Christ's Personal Appeal & Promise (Rev 3:20-21) (12 min)
-   **The Knocking Savior (v. 20)**
    -   "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock..."
    -   Imagery: Christ desires entry into the *individual* heart.
    -   Gentle, persistent appeal, not forced entry.
    -   [Whiteboard: Rev 3:20 - Christ at the Heart's Door -> Knocking -> Waiting]
-   **The Invitation to Fellowship (v. 20b)**
    -   "...if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me."
    -   'Sup with him': Intimate, personal fellowship and communion.
    -   What does 'opening the door' look like practically? **(RQ)** (Surrender, repentance, welcoming His presence and Lordship).
    -   [Concept (based on v.20): Imagine Christ waiting patiently. What keeps our door closed? Fear? Pride? Distraction?]
-   **The Overcomer's Reward (v. 21)**
    -   "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne..."
    -   Overcoming what? The Laodicean condition (lukewarmness, self-deception) by applying His remedy (v. 18-19).
    -   The ultimate promise: Sharing Christ's victory, authority, and eternal kingdom.
    -   Connects effort (zeal, repentance, opening the door) with divine enablement and reward.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
-   Recap: Laodicea's dangerous state (lukewarm, blind self-sufficiency), Christ's loving diagnosis, His freely offered remedy (faith, righteousness, discernment), and His personal plea for fellowship.
-   The Choice is Individual: Christ knocks, but *we* must open the door (v. 20).
-   Final Exhortation (v. 22): "He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches."
    -   Is the Spirit speaking to *us* today through this message? **(RQ)**
-   Appeal: Choose today to reject lukewarmness. Seek the true riches in Christ. Open the door fully to Him. Embrace His loving correction and be zealous for genuine faith.
-   Prayer: For ears to hear, hearts to open, and zeal to follow Christ fully.
