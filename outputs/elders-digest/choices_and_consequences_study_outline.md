### Introduction (6 min)

-   **Hook:** Relatable scenario - a small choice with unforeseen large consequences (e.g., a minor detour leading to a major event).
-   **Core Concept:** Introduce free will as a foundational gift from God, essential for genuine love and relationship.
-   **Study Purpose:** To explore the biblical perspective on our choices: their source, their power, God's guidance, and their eternal significance.
-   **Central Verse Intro:** Joshua 24:15 - The unavoidable call to choose allegiance. `[Whiteboard: Joshua 24:15 - "Choose you this day..."]`

### Section 1: The Divine Gift & Responsibility (10 min)

-   **Focus:** Understanding free will as God's design and our resulting accountability.
-   **Biblical Foundation:** Deuteronomy 30:19 - God clearly presents the options: life/blessing vs. death/cursing. `[Whiteboard: Deut 30:19 - Life vs. Death | Blessing vs. Cursing]`
    -   God grants freedom (Genesis 2:16-17 - The choice in Eden).
    -   This freedom necessitates responsibility. Our choices matter eternally.
    -   **(RQ)** How does knowing our choices have *eternal* consequences shift our perspective on seemingly 'small' daily decisions?
-   **God's Guidance vs. Coercion:**
    -   God provides guidance: His Word, conscience (inner voice aligned with Word), circumstances (providence). `[Whiteboard: Guidance: Word | Conscience | Circumstances]`
    -   He respects our choice; He does not force obedience.
    -   **Illustrative Concept:** Pilate's wife's dream (ref. DA 732) - A clear divine warning, yet Pilate retained the freedom to choose, tragically choosing wrongly.

### Section 2: The Great Controversy & Allegiance [*] (12 min)

-   **Focus:** The impossibility of neutrality in the spiritual battle and the call to choose Christ over the world.
-   **Biblical Foundation:** Matthew 12:30 - Jesus declares there is no middle ground. `[Whiteboard: Matt 12:30 - With Christ OR Against Christ = No Neutrality]`
    -   The cosmic conflict (Rev 12:7-9) involves everyone; neutrality is an illusion.
    -   Attempting neutrality effectively aligns one with the forces opposing Christ.
    -   **(RQ)** What are some subtle ways we might try to remain 'neutral' or avoid taking a clear stand for Christ in our culture today?
-   **Choosing Allegiance:**
    -   Revisit Joshua 24:15 - Consciously choosing God over worldly influences/popular opinion. `[Whiteboard: Worldly Counsel vs. God's Word (Josh 24:15)]`
    -   Ref. Romans 12:2 - The call to be transformed, not conformed.
-   **Practical Denial of Christ:**
    -   Denial isn't just verbal; it's practical.
    -   Examples: Neglecting Bible study/prayer (choosing self-reliance), avoiding fellowship/witness, engaging in gossip/criticism (undermining His body). (Ref. 1 Tim 5:13, James 4:11)
    -   **(RQ)** How can consistently neglecting personal prayer be seen as a practical denial of dependence on Christ?
    -   `[Aside: "Our daily habits, seemingly small, are like votes cast in the Great Controversy. Neglecting prayer isn't just forgetting; it's choosing self-reliance over divine connection, subtly siding against Christ."]`

### Section 3: Choices, Character, and Eternity (11 min)

-   **Focus:** How our choices shape who we become and determine our eternal destiny.
-   **Biblical Foundation 1:** Matthew 10:32-33 - Confessing or denying Christ before others has direct implications for the final judgment. `[Whiteboard: Matt 10:32-33 -> Confess/Deny -> Judgment]`
    -   Our earthly choices are testimonies recorded in heaven.
    -   **(RQ)** How does this passage connect our daily witness (or lack thereof) to our standing before God?
-   **Biblical Foundation 2:** Galatians 6:7-8 - The unchangeable law of sowing and reaping applies spiritually. `[Whiteboard: Gal 6:7-8 - Sow (Choices) -> Reap (Consequences/Character)]`
    -   Choices sow seeds that produce a harvest of character and destiny.
    -   Sowing to the flesh (self-centered choices) vs. Sowing to the Spirit (God-centered choices).
-   **Character Formation & Integrity:**
    -   Consistent choices shape our character, aligning us more closely with Christ or the world (Ref. 2 Cor 3:18 - beholding -> becoming).
    -   The critical need for unwavering principle: 'Stand for the right though the heavens fall' (EGW, Education 57). `[Whiteboard: Integrity = Stand for Right]`
    -   This integrity reflects the goal of Character Perfection – mirroring Christ through His grace.
    -   `[Aside: "Integrity isn't just about big heroic moments; it's built in the small, consistent choices to align with God's Word, even when inconvenient or unpopular. It's like building a house brick by brick – each right choice strengthens the foundation for eternity."]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** Recap the journey: We have God-given free will (Deut 30:19); every choice carries weight (Gal 6:7-8); neutrality is impossible (Matt 12:30); our choices shape our character and eternal destiny (Matt 10:32-33).
-   **Revisit Central Verse:** Joshua 24:15 - Emphasize the personal, present urgency: "Choose *you* *this day* whom ye will serve." This isn't a one-time decision, but a daily reaffirmation.
-   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Text):** How can we actively choose God?
    1.  **Daily Dedication:** Begin each day consciously choosing God's side. A simple prayer: "Lord, today I choose You. Guide my choices." (Reflects Joshua 24:15, Deut 30:19)
    2.  **Filter Choices through Scripture:** Before making decisions, ask: "Does this align with God's Word? Is this sowing to the Spirit or the flesh?" (Reflects Gal 6:7-8, Rom 12:2)
    3.  **Seek Opportunities to Confess:** Look for small ways to affirm your faith in conversations or actions, strengthening your public stand for Christ. (Reflects Matt 10:32-33)
-   **Gentle Invitation:** Let's prayerfully consider these simple steps. How can we intentionally weave these practices into our lives this week, allowing God to transform our choices and, through them, our character?
-   **Final Appeal:** The choice remains before each of us, just as it was for Israel. Will we, like Joshua, declare with conviction, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord"? Let us choose life, that both we and our seed may live (Deut 30:19). Choose Him today.
