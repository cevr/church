### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with the concept of ultimate safety. What truly protects us from eternal danger?
-   **Centrality:** Paul's focus: "Jesus Christ, and Him crucified" (1 Cor 2:2). Why this singular focus?
-   **The Blood:** Not a morbid topic, but the *key* to life, protection, and relationship with God.
-   **Roadmap:** We'll explore the power of Christ's blood using the Passover as a type, revealing its ongoing relevance for: Safety, Submission, Substitution, Cleansing, and Service.

### Section 1: Passover Pattern - Safety & Security (10 min)

-   **The Context:** Israel in Egypt, facing judgment (Exodus 11, 12).
-   **God's Provision:** The Lamb (Exodus 12:3-6).
    -   Without blemish - foreshadowing Christ (1 Peter 1:19).
-   **The Command:** Apply the blood (Exodus 12:7).
    -   [Whiteboard: Exodus 12:7 - Blood on Doorposts]
    -   Not just killing the lamb, but *applying* the blood was crucial.
-   **The Promise:** Divine Protection (Exodus 12:13).
    -   "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."
    -   Safety wasn't based on *their* goodness, but on the *blood*.
    -   **(RQ):** What does this tell us about the basis of our security before God?
-   **Christ Our Passover:** The fulfillment (1 Cor 5:7b).
    -   [Whiteboard: Lamb's Blood (Type) -> Christ's Blood (Reality)]
    -   His sacrifice provides *real* safety from the judgment of sin.
    -   [Aside: Like a vaccine provides specific protection against a disease, Christ's blood provides specific protection against the plague of eternal death due to sin.]

### Section 2: Personal Application - Submission & Substitution (12 min) [*]

-   **The Condition:** Stay *inside* the house (Exodus 12:22).
    -   The blood protected only those who submitted to God's instructions.
    -   [Whiteboard: Safety (Blood) + Submission (Inside) = Protection]
    -   **(RQ):** How do we 'stay inside' the protection of Christ's blood today? (Hint: Faith, Obedience, Abiding - John 15:4)
    -   Personal application is necessary. The blood is available, but we must choose its covering.
-   **The Substitute:** Why did the lamb (and ultimately Christ) have to die?
    -   Wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23).
    -   God's justice required payment.
    -   Christ took *our* place (Isaiah 53:5-6).
    -   [Whiteboard: Isaiah 53:5 - Wounded for US]
    -   **Crucial Quote (Substitution):**
        -   "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was His. 'With His stripes we are healed.'" (Desire of Ages, p. 25).
        -   [Write on board: DA 25 - He took OUR place.]
    -   **(RQ):** Have we truly grasped the reality that He died the death *we* deserved?

### Section 3: Powerful Results - Cleansing & Service (12 min)

-   **Justification:** Accepted through His blood (Romans 5:9).
    -   [Whiteboard: Romans 5:9 - Justified by His Blood]
    -   Declared righteous, not based on our merit, but His sacrifice.
    -   We are saved from God's wrath *through Him*.
-   **Cleansing:** Continuous purification (1 John 1:7, 9).
    -   [Whiteboard: 1 John 1:7 - Blood CLEANSES from ALL sin]
    -   **(RQ):** What does 'walking in the light' mean in the context of receiving cleansing?
    -   It's not just a one-time event at conversion, but an ongoing reality for the believer who confesses and trusts.
    -   [Analogy (from 1 John 1:7): Like constantly washing hands under running water, walking in the light keeps us under the continuous cleansing flow of Christ's blood.]
-   **Sanctification & Service:** Empowered for God's work (Hebrews 9:14).
    -   [Whiteboard: Hebrews 9:14 - Purged Conscience -> SERVE God]
    -   The blood doesn't just save *from* something (wrath, sin's penalty), it frees *for* something (service).
    -   It cleanses the *conscience* (our inner moral compass/motivator) from 'dead works' (actions done without faith or love, trying to earn salvation).
    -   **(RQ):** How does understanding the blood's power change our motivation for serving God?
    -   [Aside: True service isn't a burden to earn favor, but a joyful response to grace already received. It's like a rescued person wanting to help the rescuer – gratitude fuels action.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** The blood of Christ is not symbolic, it's powerful reality providing:
    -   **Safety:** From judgment (Passover Type -> 1 Cor 5:7)
    -   **Requires Submission:** Choosing to abide under its protection (Ex 12:22 -> John 15:4)
    -   **Based on Substitution:** Christ took our penalty (Isaiah 53:5, DA 25)
    -   **Results in Cleansing:** Ongoing purification from sin (1 John 1:7)
    -   **Empowers for Service:** A clean conscience to serve the living God (Heb 9:14)
-   **Centrality Reaffirmed:** Everything hinges on "Jesus Christ, and Him crucified."
-   **Continual Need:** We must continually apply and claim the power of the blood through faith.
    -   **(RQ):** Are you living under the protection and power of the blood today?

    -   Personal reflection: Am I relying on my efforts, or the power of His blood?
