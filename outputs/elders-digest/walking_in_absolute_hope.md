### Introduction (5 min)

*   Greeting & Prayer
*   Introduce Topic: What is Christian hope? Is it just wishful thinking, like hoping for good weather? **(RQ)**
*   Contrast worldly hope (uncertain, often based on circumstances) vs. Biblical hope (certain, based on God's character and promises).
*   Read Central Verse: 1 Corinthians 15:58. Introduce it as our roadmap for living with absolute hope.
    *   [Write on board: 1 Cor 15:58 - Steadfast, Unmovable, Abounding, Not in Vain]
*   Purpose: To understand the *certainty* of our hope rooted in Christ and how it empowers steadfast, practical Christian living.

### Section 1: The Foundation - A Living Hope (10 min)

*   **The Source of Hope:** Christ's Resurrection
    *   1 Peter 1:3 - God has "begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
    *   Our hope isn't static; it's *living* because Christ is living! (Acts 1:3)
    *   [Write on board: Hope Source = Resurrection (1 Pet 1:3)]
*   **The Promise of Hope:** God's Unchanging Word
    *   Titus 1:2 - We have "hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began."
    *   This hope predates our existence; it's rooted in God's eternal plan and His very nature. He *cannot* lie. (Numbers 23:19)
    *   How firm is a promise from someone who existed before time and cannot lie? **(RQ)**
*   **The Object of Hope:** Eternal Life through Christ
    *   This isn't just hope for a better tomorrow, but hope for *eternal life* (Titus 1:2) secured through Jesus (John 3:16).
    *   [Aside: The phrase "before the world began" (pro chronōn aiōniōn) emphasizes the eternal, unchanging nature of God's plan of salvation. It wasn't a reaction, but a foreordained purpose.]

### Section 2: The Nature - An Anchoring Hope (8 min) [*]

*   **Hope as an Anchor:** Stability in Life's Storms
    *   Hebrews 6:19 - "Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast..."
    *   Analogy: Like a ship in a storm needs an anchor holding firm to the seabed, our souls need hope anchored in God's promises to keep us from drifting.
    *   [Write on board: Hope = Anchor (Heb 6:19) -> Sure & Stedfast]
*   **Qualities of the Anchor:** Sure and Stedfast
    *   "Sure" (asphalēs): dependable, not liable to fail.
    *   "Stedfast" (bebaios): firm, stable, secure.
    *   This anchor reaches "into that within the veil" (Hebrews 6:19) - it's fixed in the heavenly sanctuary, where Christ ministers (Hebrews 8:1-2). Our hope isn't anchored on earth, but in heaven itself.
*   **Result:** Unmovable Position
    *   This anchoring hope enables us to be "stedfast, unmoveable" as called for in 1 Cor 15:58. We aren't tossed about by circumstances or doubts (Ephesians 4:14).
    *   What happens to a ship without an anchor in a storm? What happens to a soul without this hope? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: The Motivation - Grace-Fueled Abounding Service (10 min)

*   **The Fuel for Service:** God's Abundant Grace
    *   Ephesians 1:7-8 - We have "redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace; Wherein he hath abounded toward us..."
    *   Our service ("abounding in the work of the Lord" - 1 Cor 15:58) isn't *to earn* grace, but flows *from* the abundance of grace already received.
    *   [Write on board: Grace (Eph 1:7-8) -> Abounding Work (1 Cor 15:58)]
*   **The Nature of Service:** "Abounding in the Work of the Lord"
    *   "Abounding" (perisseuō): overflowing, more than enough, excelling. Not minimal effort, but generous, wholehearted service.
    *   "Work of the Lord": Activities done for God's glory and the advancement of His kingdom (e.g., sharing faith, serving others, supporting the church - Colossians 3:23-24).
    *   [Aside: Ellen White often emphasizes practical godliness and service stemming from a heart transformed by grace. "True sanctification... is revealed in obedience to all the commandments of God." (Faith and Works, p. 99)]
*   **The Connection:** Hope Empowers Service
    *   Knowing our hope is secure (Sections 1 & 2) frees us from self-focus and empowers us to serve others generously out of gratitude for God's grace.
    *   How does knowing your future is secure change how you live and serve today? **(RQ)**

### Section 4: The Assurance - Labor Not In Vain (7 min)

*   **The Certainty of Reward:** Christ is Coming
    *   Revelation 22:12 - "And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be."
    *   Our labor has ultimate meaning because Christ *is* returning and will reward faithfulness.
*   **The Promise:** "Your Labour is Not in Vain in the Lord"
    *   1 Corinthians 15:58b - "...forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."
    *   "Not in vain" (ou kenos): not empty, fruitless, or without purpose.
    *   Even if results aren't immediately visible, work done "in the Lord" has eternal significance and value.
    *   [Write on board: Labor + In the Lord = NOT IN VAIN (1 Cor 15:58)]
*   **Contrast:** Labor outside of Christ *is* ultimately vain (Ecclesiastes 2:11). Only work connected to God's eternal purpose endures.
    *   Illustration: Building a sandcastle vs. building with eternal materials. Our work "in the Lord" is building with eternal materials.

### Conclusion & Practical Application (5 min)

*   **Recap:** Our hope is living (Resurrection), promised (God's Word), anchoring (Sure & Stedfast), fueled by grace, and guarantees our labor is not in vain.
*   **Need/Question (from text):** Do you sometimes feel discouraged, wondering if your efforts for God matter? Does life feel unstable? (Reflects need for steadfastness/assurance).
*   **Biblical Principle (from text):** Because of the certainty of the resurrection and Christ's return, our hope is absolute, enabling us to be steadfast, unmovable, and always abounding in God's work, knowing it has eternal value (1 Cor 15:58).
*   **Bridging (from text):** This ancient promise directly addresses modern feelings of futility or instability. Our daily work, service, and perseverance gain meaning when anchored in this hope.
*   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Be Steadfast:** Anchor daily in God's Word and prayer, reaffirming the hope found in His promises (Heb 6:19).
    2.  **Be Unmovable:** When doubts or trials come, consciously recall the foundation – Christ's resurrection and God's unchanging character (Titus 1:2; 1 Pet 1:3).
    3.  **Be Abounding:** Look for one specific way this week to serve "in the Lord," fueled by gratitude for His grace (Eph 1:7-8).
*   **Invitation:** Let's choose to live not by sight, but by the absolute hope we have in Christ. Let this hope make us steadfast, unmovable, and joyfully active in His service, knowing our labor is never in vain.
*   Closing Prayer
