### Introduction (5 min)

-   **The Need:** Life demands choices. How do we navigate wisely?
-   **The Call:** Christians are explicitly called to walk wisely.
    -   Read Ephesians 5:15-17. Emphasize "circumspectly," "not as fools," "understanding the will of the Lord."
    -   [Whiteboard: Eph 5:15-17 -> Walk Wisely]
    -   What does it mean to *not* be wise in our daily walk? **(RQ)**
-   **The Problem:** We often rely on our own understanding (Prov 3:5 reference).
-   **The Solution:** God provides a guide. Where do we find this divine wisdom?

### Section 1: The Call to Wisdom & Its Source (10 min)

-   **God's Provision: His Word**
    -   Read 2 Timothy 3:16-17. All Scripture is God-breathed.
    -   Purpose: Doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction in righteousness.
    -   Goal: That the man of God may be perfect (mature, complete), thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
    -   [Whiteboard: 2 Tim 3:16-17 -> Scripture = God's Toolkit for Good Works]
    -   How does seeing Scripture as a toolkit change how we approach it? **(RQ)**
-   **Defining Wisdom (Beyond Knowledge)**
    -   Not just knowing facts, but insight leading to *right application*.
    -   [Whiteboard: Knowledge (Facts) + Insight -> Wisdom (Right Action)]
    -   [Analogy (from text): Scripture like a map (knowledge), wisdom is knowing how to read the map and follow the right path.]
-   **The Foundation:** True wisdom begins with reverence for God (Prov 9:10 - mention briefly).

### Section 2: Proverbs: God's Wisdom Curriculum (12 min) [*]

-   **Specific Instruction:** Introduce the book of Proverbs.
    -   Read Proverbs 1:1-6. Note the explicit purpose.
    -   [Whiteboard: Prov 1:1-6 -> Purpose: Wisdom, Instruction, Justice, Judgment, Equity]
    -   How practical is this? These cover nearly every area of life! **(RQ)**
-   **Wisdom as a Guard:** Protecting from common pitfalls.
    -   **Pitfall 1: Evil Companionship**
        -   Read Proverbs 1:10-19. Vivid warning against peer pressure to do wrong.
        -   Focus on v. 10 ("consent thou not") and v. 15 ("walk not thou in the way with them").
        -   [Whiteboard: Prov 1:10-19 -> Danger: Wrong Friends -> Action: Consent Not!]
        -   How does this apply to influences today (online, media, social groups)? **(RQ)**
    -   **Pitfall 2: Immorality (Example)**
        -   Briefly reference Proverbs 5:1-14 (or select key verses like 3-8, 11-14). Highlight the path to destruction vs. the path of wisdom.
        -   Emphasize the consequences described (regret, loss).
        -   [Whiteboard: Prov 5 -> Danger: Immorality -> Consequence: Regret/Loss]
-   **Learning Method:** God offers wisdom through His Word to avoid painful lessons.
    -   We can learn from inspired counsel (Proverbs) OR hard experience.
    -   [Aside: It's like having the exam answers beforehand. God, through Proverbs, shows us the pitfalls and the path to success. Why choose the failing grade of experience when He offers the 'A' through His Word?]

### Section 3: Acquiring & Applying Wisdom (12 min)

-   **The Process: Seeking God**
    -   Read Proverbs 2:1-6. Note the action verbs: receive, hide, incline, apply, cry, lift up, seek, search.
    -   This requires *effort* and *diligence*.
    -   [Whiteboard: Prov 2:1-6 -> How to Get Wisdom: Receive, Seek, Ask, Search Diligently]
    -   What does 'searching for wisdom as for hid treasures' look like practically? **(RQ)**
-   **The Indispensable Role of Prayer**
    -   Read James 1:5-8. If you lack wisdom, *ask God*.
    -   Conditions: Ask in faith, without wavering.
    -   [Whiteboard: James 1:5-8 -> Lack Wisdom? -> Ask God in Faith!]
    -   Why is faith essential when asking for wisdom? **(RQ)**
-   **The Ultimate Source: Christ**
    -   Wisdom isn't just principles; it's a Person.
    -   1 Corinthians 1:30 - Christ *is made unto us* wisdom...
    -   Colossians 2:3 - In Christ are hid *all* the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
    -   [Whiteboard: True Wisdom <-> Connection with CHRIST (1 Cor 1:30, Col 2:3)]
    -   Biblical wisdom always leads us to a deeper relationship with Jesus.
    -   [Aside: Think of wisdom like light. We can learn principles about light, but true illumination comes from the Source – the Sun. Christ is the 'Sun' of Righteousness, the source of all true wisdom.]
-   **Practical Steps (Derived from Texts):**
    1.  **Daily Intake:** Commit to reading God's Word daily, especially Proverbs, looking for practical instruction (Prov 2:1-2; 2 Tim 3:16).
    2.  **Pray Specifically:** Ask God for wisdom for specific situations, believing He will give it (James 1:5-6).
    3.  **Choose Influences Wisely:** Consciously avoid influences that contradict God's Word (Prov 1:10, 15).
    4.  **Connect to Christ:** Seek a deeper relationship with Jesus, the embodiment of wisdom (Col 2:3).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Recap:** God calls us to walk wisely (Eph 5:15-17). He provides the ultimate guide – His Word, rich with practical instruction like Proverbs (2 Tim 3:16-17; Prov 1:1-6).
-   **Accessibility:** This wisdom guards us (Prov 1:10ff) and is available through diligent seeking and prayer (Prov 2:1-6; James 1:5).
-   **Centrality of Christ:** True, lasting wisdom is found only in connection with Jesus Christ (1 Cor 1:30).
-   **The Choice:** Will we lean on our own understanding, learning wisdom through painful mistakes? Or will we diligently seek God's wisdom through His Word and prayer?
-   **Invitation:** Commit today to seeking God's wisdom daily. Start with prayer (James 1:5) and opening His Word (Prov 2:1-6), asking Him to guide your steps through Christ.
