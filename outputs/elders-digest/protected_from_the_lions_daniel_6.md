### Section 1: Integrity Under Scrutiny (Dan 6:1-9) (10 min)
- **Daniel's Excellent Spirit (v. 3)**
    - Defined by integrity, faithfulness, diligence.
    - Connection: God honors those who honor Him (1 Sam. 2:30 applied).

- **The Conspiracy (v. 4-5)**
    - Enemies found no fault *except* concerning the Law of his God.
    - His faithfulness *became* the target. **(RQ)** How often is faithfulness the very thing the world attacks in believers?
    - [Whiteboard: Attack Point (v.5) -> Faithfulness to God's Law]
- **Human Law vs. God's Law (v. 6-9)**
    - The unchangeable decree forbidding prayer to anyone but Darius.
    - A clear conflict designed to trap Daniel.
    - Principle: When human laws conflict with God's requirements (Acts 5:29).
    - [Write Question on Board: Earthly Law vs. God's Law - Our Guide? (Acts 5:29)]

### Section 2: Unwavering Devotion (Dan 6:10-15) (12 min) [*]
- **Daniel's Consistent Prayer (v. 10)**
    - He *knew* the decree, yet prayed openly "as was his custom since early days."
    - Not defiance for show, but dependence for survival.
    - Power/Necessity of Prayer: Consistent communion = source of strength (Phil 4:6-7).
    - [Whiteboard: Daniel's Response (v.10) -> Consistent Prayer (Habitual Dependence)]
    - **(RQ)** How does a *consistent* prayer life prepare us before trials hit?
- **Accusation and the King's Distress (v. 11-15)**
    - Daniel's faithfulness reported; the king is trapped by his own decree.
    - Illustrates limits of human power and folly of prideful laws.
    - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our lives should represent the kingdom of heaven, even when earthly laws conflict. Daniel's consistency showed where his true allegiance lay.]

### Section 3: Divine Deliverance & Witness (Dan 6:16-28) (12 min)
- **Into the Lions' Den (v. 16-18)**
    - King's reluctant hope: "Your God, whom you serve continually, He will deliver you." (v. 16)
    - Even pagan rulers can recognize genuine, consistent faith.
    - Contrast: King's restless night vs. Daniel's implied peace.
- **God's Miraculous Intervention (v. 19-23)**
    - King's anxious question (v. 20).
    - Daniel's testimony: "My God sent His angel and shut the lions' mouths..." (v. 22).
    - Reason Given: "...because I was found innocent before Him; and also, O king, I have done no wrong before you." (v. 22) - Integrity + Faithfulness.
    - [Whiteboard: Deliverance (v.22) -> Angelic Power -> Reason: Innocence/Faithfulness]
    - God's power in impossible situations. He provides strength *through* trials (Phil. 4:13).
    - [Analogy (from v.22): Faith like Daniel's doesn't always remove the den, but trusts God to shut the lions' mouths or give strength within it.]
- **Powerful Witness & Decree (v. 24-28)**
    - Judgment on accusers (v. 24).
    - Darius's Decree (v. 25-27): Proclaims the living God, the God of Daniel, throughout the empire.
    - Evangelism through Character: Daniel's faithfulness led to widespread testimony.
    - [Whiteboard: Outcome -> Darius's Decree (v.26-27) -> Global Witness to God's Power]
    - **(RQ)** How does our response to trials impact our witness for God?

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
- **Summary:** Daniel's story highlights integrity, the power of consistent prayer, God's deliverance, and the impact of a faithful life.
- **Character Perfection:** Daniel's steadfastness exemplifies the character God desires to perfect in His people through grace (Eph 4:13, Titus 2:11-14).
- **Last Day Urgency/Prophecy:** Daniel's deliverance is a type of God's final deliverance of His faithful people facing end-time persecution (Rev. 13:15-17) before the Second Coming (Rev. 19:11-19).
    - [Write on Board: Daniel's Deliverance -> Type of Final Deliverance (Rev 19)]
- **Practical Application:** Our strength, like Daniel's, is found in daily communion (prayer, Bible study). Integrity in *all* circumstances is our witness.
- [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom... Daniel operated within a pagan system but remained faithful, influencing it for God. We too can be faithful witnesses wherever God places us, letting our character speak.]
- **Invitation:** Commit to consistent time with God. Choose faithfulness over compromise, trusting His power to sustain you (Phil 4:13). Stand firm, knowing God honors those who honor Him (1 Sam 2:30).
- Final Prayer.
