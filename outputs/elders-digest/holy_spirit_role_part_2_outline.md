### Introduction (5 min)

- Briefly state focus: The Holy Spirit's vital role _after_ Christ's ascension.
- Central Question: Christ ascended, yet promised to be with us always (Matt
  28:20). How? **(RQ)**
- Introduce Central Verse: John 14:16-18 - The promise of the Comforter.
- [Whiteboard: Title + Central Q: How is Christ still with us? + John 14:16-18]
- Thesis: The Holy Spirit is Christ's personal successor and representative,
  making His presence real and enabling His work in and through us.

### Section 1: The Spirit as Christ's Personal Representative (10 min)

- **Biblical Foundation:** John 14:16-18
  - Verse 16: "Another Comforter" (Gk. _allos parakletos_).
  - [Whiteboard: *Allos* = Another of the *Same Kind* (as Christ)]
  - The Spirit is not merely an influence, but a Divine Person, just like
    Christ.
  - Verse 17: "He dwelleth _with_ you, and shall be _in_ you." - Intimate,
    personal presence.
  - Verse 18: "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you." - How
    fulfilled? Through the Spirit.
- **Theological Unpacking:**
  - The Spirit _is_ the very presence of Christ with the believer (DA 669).
  - He makes Christ's sacrifice and righteousness effective for us personally.
  - How does knowing the Spirit is Christ's personal representative change how
    we relate to Him? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Spirit's Work in Salvation & Christian Living [*] (12 min)

- **Biblical Foundation:** John 16:7-11; Romans 8:9, 14; Galatians 5:22-25
- **The Need/Question:** How does conversion happen? How can we live a godly
  life? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle/Solution:**
  - **Conviction & Repentance:** John 16:7-11
    - The Spirit convicts of sin (our state), righteousness (Christ's standard &
      provision), judgment (consequences & accountability).
    - [Whiteboard: Spirit's Work: Conviction (Jn 16:8) -> Repentance (Acts
      5:31)]
    - No genuine repentance without the Spirit (DA 175).
  - **Indwelling & Life:** Romans 8:9, 14
    - Verse 9: Having the Spirit is the defining mark of belonging to Christ.
    - Verse 14: Being "led by the Spirit" signifies sonship and active guidance.
    - [Whiteboard: Rom 8:9 - Spirit Indwelling = Belonging to Christ]
  - **Character Transformation:** Galatians 5:22-25
    - Verses 22-23: The Fruit of the Spirit = Christ's character reproduced in
      us.
    - [Whiteboard: Fruit (Gal 5:22-23) = Christ's Character Restored]
    - Connect to CPTS 362: Spirit works to restore God's image.
    - [Aside: Like a skilled artisan restoring a masterpiece, the Spirit
      meticulously works within us, using God's Word as His tool, to bring back
      the reflection of Christ's character lost through sin.]
    - Verse 25: "If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit." - A
      command based on a reality.
- **Bridging to Practice:**
  - Recognize conviction not as condemnation, but the Spirit drawing you to
    Christ.
  - Understand that consistent Christian living isn't self-effort but
    Spirit-dependence.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1.  Pray daily for the Spirit's filling and leading (Luke 11:13).
  2.  Cooperate with His convictions immediately.
  3.  Look for the Fruit of the Spirit as evidence of His work.

### Section 3: The Spirit's Role in Mission & Empowerment (12 min)

- **Biblical Foundation:** Luke 4:18-19; Acts 1:8
- **The Need/Question:** How can the church possibly fulfill the Great
  Commission? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle/Solution:**
  - **Christ's Blueprint:** Luke 4:18-19 (Isa 61)
    - Jesus began His ministry _anointed_ by the Spirit.
    - [Whiteboard: Luke 4:18 - "The Spirit of the Lord is UPON ME..."]
    - His mission (preach, heal, liberate) was Spirit-empowered.
    - This is our model.
  - **The Church's Power:** Acts 1:8
    - "Ye shall receive _power_, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you..."
    - [Whiteboard: Acts 1:8 -> Holy Spirit = POWER for Witness]
    - This power is divine enablement, not human talent.
    - Essential for proclaiming the Three Angels' Messages.
- **Bridging to Practice:**
  - [Analogy (from Acts 1:8): Trying to witness without the Spirit is like
    trying to drive a car with no fuel â€“ the vehicle is there, but the power to
    move is missing.]
  - Our effectiveness in sharing truth depends entirely on Spirit-empowerment.
  - Connect to Last Generation Theology: A Spirit-filled people reflects Christ
    fully and finishes the work.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1.  Pray specifically for the Spirit's power before engaging in
      outreach/witness.
  2.  Rely on His guidance for _what_ to say and _how_ to say it.
  3.  Attribute results to God's Spirit, not personal ability.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** The Holy Spirit is Christ personally present with us, convicting,
  regenerating, sanctifying, and empowering for mission.
- **Central Truth:** Our dependence on Him is absolute (John 15:5 applied).
- [Whiteboard: Dependence on Spirit = TOTAL (John 15:5)]
- **Challenge:** Are we living in conscious moment-by-moment dependence on the
  Spirit? Are we actively seeking His fullness? **(RQ)**
- **Practical Invitation:** Make seeking the Holy Spirit (His presence,
  guidance, power) the first act of each day.
- **Call to Prayer:** Plead for the Latter Rain outpouring (Zech 10:1) - for
  personal readiness and worldwide mission completion.
- Final Thought: He is the promised gift, essential for life and witness. Let us
  receive Him fully.
- Closing Hymn.
