### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- The Constant Tension: Commitment vs. Compromise.
  - Commitment: Full devotion, allegiance.
  - Compromise: Settling by mutual concession; lowering standards.
- Introduce Exodus narrative: Case study in divine power vs. worldly pressure.
- Central Question: Where do we draw the line? Where does God draw the line?
  **(RQ)**
- [Whiteboard: Commitment <---> Compromise?]

### Section 1: God's Undisputed Authority (10 min)

- Setting the Scene: Israel in Egypt (Exodus 1). God's people under oppressive
  world power.
- God's Intervention: Demonstrating His Power over Egypt's gods & Pharaoh.
  - Purpose: Reveal Himself as the only true God (Exodus 7:5, 17; 8:10, 22;
    9:14, 16).
  - Examples: Plagues targeting specific Egyptian deities (Nile, frogs, sun).
    [Briefly mention 1-2].
  - Focus: God's absolute sovereignty. He sets the terms (Exodus 5:1-2 vs Exodus
    12:31-32).
- Key Principle: God's authority is supreme over worldly systems (Psalm 115:3).
- [Whiteboard: God's Power > Pharaoh's Power (Exodus 7-12)]

### Section 2: Satan's Strategy: The Compromise Proposals (12 min)

- When Power Fails, Satan Suggests Compromise: Pharaoh's attempts to dilute
  God's command ("Let my people go, that they may serve me" - Ex 8:1).
- [Whiteboard: Pharaoh's Compromises vs. God's Command]
- **Compromise 1: Worship Here (Exodus 8:25)**
  - Pharaoh: "Sacrifice to your God _in the land_."
  - Temptation: Blend in, don't be distinct, worship conveniently within the
    world's system.
  - Modern Parallel: Compromising worship standards/Sabbath to fit culture?
    **(RQ)**
- **Compromise 2: Don't Go Too Far (Exodus 8:28)**
  - Pharaoh: "Go... only ye shall not go very far away."
  - Temptation: Maintain proximity to the world, keep worldly options open.
  - Modern Parallel: Living close to worldly influences (entertainment,
    associations)? **(RQ)** (1 Cor 15:33).
- **Compromise 3: Leave Some Behind (Men Only) (Exodus 10:8-11)**
  - Pharaoh: "Go serve the Lord... but who are they that shall go?... Go now ye
    that are men."
  - Temptation: Segmented commitment; keep family/future tied to the world.
  - Modern Parallel: Prioritizing worldly things over family worship/spiritual
    training? **(RQ)**
- **Compromise 4: Leave Possessions Behind (Exodus 10:24-26)**
  - Pharaoh: "Go serve the Lord; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed."
  - Temptation: Serve God spiritually, but keep material assets tied to the
    world (Matt 6:24).
  - Modern Parallel: Holding back resources from God? Trusting wealth over God?
    **(RQ)**
- Moses' Unwavering Response: "There shall not an hoof be left behind" (Exodus
  10:26). Total separation, total obedience.
- [Aside: Compromise often starts small, seeming reasonable. Like a small leak,
  it can eventually sink the ship. Satan rarely asks for outright apostasy
  initially, just a 'small' concession.]

### Section 3: The Unwavering Standard: Total Commitment [*] (12 min)

- The Need/Question: Why is absolute commitment necessary? Can't we find a
  middle ground? **(RQ)**
- The Biblical Principle: God requires _all_ of us.
  - **Total Surrender:** Romans 12:1 - "Present your bodies a living sacrifice,
    holy, acceptable unto God." Our "reasonable service."
    - [Whiteboard: Romans 12:1 = Living Sacrifice (ALL)]
    - Not conforming, but transforming (Romans 12:2). Requires renewed mind.
  - **Distinct Lifestyle:** _In_ the world, not _of_ it.
    - John 15:19 - World hates believers because they are not of the world.
    - John 17:14-17 - Jesus' prayer: Keep them from evil, sanctify through
      truth. Separation for protection & consecration.
    - [Whiteboard: John 17:16 - In the world, NOT OF the world]
  - **Family Commitment:** Unified front against compromise.
    - Joshua 24:15 - "Choose you this day... as for me and my house, we will
      serve the Lord." Conscious choice.
    - [Whiteboard: Joshua 24:15 - Me AND My House]
  - **Rejecting Worldly Affection:** Cannot love God and the world system.
    - 1 John 2:15 - "Love not the world..." Worldly love = enmity with God
      (James 4:4).
- Bridging to Practice: How does "not conforming" (Rom 12:2) look practically?
  **(RQ)**
  - Choices in entertainment, dress, speech, use of time/resources.
  - [Analogy (from Rom 12:1): A sacrifice laid on the altar was fully consumed.
    A *living* sacrifice means continually choosing to yield every part of life
    to God.]
- Actionable Steps (derived from texts):
  1.  **Identify:** Prayerfully ask God to reveal compromise (Ps 139:23-24).
  2.  **Decide:** Reaffirm commitment like Joshua (Josh 24:15).
  3.  **Renew:** Seek mind renewal via Bible study/prayer (Rom 12:2).
  4.  **Separate:** Make conscious choices aligned with God's standards (1 John
      2:15; John 17:17).
- Character Development: Steadfastness builds spiritual resilience, reflects
  Christ.

### Conclusion: The Decisive Choice (6 min)

- Recap: God's power (Exodus), Satan's strategy (compromise), God's call (total
  commitment - Rom 12:1-2, Josh 24:15, John 17:16).
- Moses' Example: Refused _every_ compromise (Exodus 10:26). Focused on God's
  word.
- The Choice Remains: Convenience or commitment? Conformance or transformation?
  **(RQ)**
- [Aside: Choosing commitment isn't a one-time event, but a daily surrender.
  Like manna, we need fresh grace and resolve each morning to stand firm against
  the subtle pressures to compromise.]
- Final Appeal: Choose total commitment. Let Christ be Lord of _all_.
  - Re-read Joshua 24:15b - "...as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
  - Re-read Romans 12:1-2 - Offer yourselves fully.
- Invitation: Commit today to reject compromise, presenting your whole life as a
  living sacrifice.
- Closing Prayer
