### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a stunning nature photo/fact (e.g., complexity of a
  hummingbird's flight, vastness of a galaxy). Ask: Where did this come from?
  **(RQ)**
- **Introduce Topic:** Today, we explore the 'footprints' God left in His
  creation â€“ evidence pointing directly to Him.
- **Central Verse:** Read Romans 1:20. Emphasize "clearly seen," "understood by
  things made," "without excuse."
  - `[Whiteboard: Romans 1:20 - Creation -> Reveals -> God's Power & Deity]`
- **Outline Preview:** We'll look at what the Bible claims about nature's
  witness, examine specific evidence, and consider the logical response.

### Main Content 1: The Biblical Claim - Nature's Witness (10 min)

- **God's Consistent Witness:**
  - Acts 14:17 - Paul argues God "left not himself without witness" through
    nature's goodness (rain, food, joy).
    - `[Whiteboard: Acts 14:17 - Witness = Goodness (Rain, Food, Joy)]`
    - How does experiencing a beautiful day or enjoying a meal point beyond
      itself? **(RQ)**
- **The Heavens Declare:**
  - Psalm 19:1 - The cosmos itself speaks of God's glory and craftsmanship.
    - `[Whiteboard: Psalm 19:1 - Heavens -> Declare -> God's Glory]`
    - Consider the scale, order, beauty of space. Could this arise randomly?
      **(RQ)**
- **Nature as Teacher:**
  - Job 12:7-10 - Job points to animals, birds, earth, fish as sources of
    knowledge about God's handiwork.
    - `[Whiteboard: Job 12:7-10 - Ask Creation -> Reveals -> God's Hand]`
    - What specific lessons about God's power or wisdom can we learn from
      observing animals or ecosystems? **(RQ)**
- **Summary Point:** Scripture consistently presents the natural world as a
  primary, accessible revelation of God's existence and attributes.

### Main Content 2: Exploring the Evidence - Design Demands a Designer [*] (12 min)

- **Evidence Area 1: Order & Precision (Astronomy/Physics)**
  - Briefly mention constants (gravity, speed of light), planetary orbits.
    Precision required for life.
  - Connect back to Psalm 19:1 - This order _is_ the glory being declared.
  - `[Illustration Concept: Watchmaker analogy - complex, ordered systems imply a designer. Apply to the universe.]`
- **Evidence Area 2: Complexity & Adaptation (Biology/Geology)**
  - Mention intricate ecosystems, symbiosis, unique adaptations (e.g.,
    woodpecker's tongue, bombardier beetle).
  - Connect back to Job 12:7-9 - The creatures themselves teach of intricate
    design.
  - `[Whiteboard: Complexity + Adaptation = Design (Not Chance)]`
- **Evidence Area 3: The Human Body**
  - Psalm 139:14 - "Fearfully and wonderfully made." Briefly touch on eye
    complexity, brain function, DNA information.
    - `[Whiteboard: Psalm 139:14 - Human Body -> Wonderful Design]`
    - How does contemplating our own bodies point to a Creator? **(RQ)**
- **SOP Affirmation:**
  - Reference _Steps to Christ_, p. 105 (or similar passage like p. 85 on
    nature): God has surrounded us with abundant evidence; nature testifies of
    His wisdom and power.
  - `[Aside: Nature is like God's 'second book.' While Scripture is the clearest revelation, creation constantly echoes its truths about the Creator's power and care, inviting us to look deeper.]`

### Main Content 3: The Logical Conclusion - Creator Worship (12 min)

- **The Irrationality of Chance:**
  - Hebrews 3:4 - "For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
    things is God."
    - Simple logic: Design requires a designer. A complex universe/life requires
      an intelligent Creator.
    - `[Whiteboard: Heb 3:4 - House -> Builder :: Universe -> GOD]`
    - Is it truly logical to believe complexity like DNA or a functioning
      ecosystem happened by accident? **(RQ)**
- **Contrast:** Briefly contrast the hope and purpose found in a designed
  creation versus the randomness and meaninglessness of atheistic evolution.
  - `[Illustration Concept: Building blocks randomly falling vs. an architect's plan. Which explains a finished house? Apply to life/universe.]`
- **The Call to Worship:**
  - Connect the evidence back to Romans 1:20 - Seeing the evidence makes us
    "without excuse."
  - Implicit link to Revelation 14:7 - The first angel calls us to "worship him
    that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
    - Understanding God as Creator is foundational to true worship.
    - `[Whiteboard: Evidence Seen (Rom 1:20) -> Worship the Creator (Rev 14:7)]`
- **Practical Response:** How does recognizing God in creation change how we
  view the world? How does it impact our faith? **(RQ)**
  - `[Aside: When we see the intricate care in a bird's nest or the vast power in a storm, it's a reminder of the character of the One we worship. It's not just abstract theology; it's tangible evidence of His involvement and majesty, calling for our awe and trust.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Recap the key scriptural points (Rom 1:20, Ps 19:1, Heb 3:4) and
  the overwhelming evidence in nature pointing to a wise, powerful Creator.
- **Reiterate Simplicity:** The evidence isn't hidden; it's clearly seen (Rom
  1:20). God made Himself known through His works.
- **Practical Application/Invitation:**
  - **Action Step 1 (Awareness):** This week, consciously look for God's
    'footprints' in nature around you (a sunrise, a plant, the weather). Reflect
    on Ps 19:1.
  - **Action Step 2 (Gratitude/Worship):** Thank God specifically for aspects of
    creation that reveal His character (power, wisdom, beauty). Connect to Rev
    14:7.
  - **Action Step 3 (Trust):** If God designed the universe with such care, can
    we trust Him with our lives? (Connect to Matt 6:26 - birds cared for).
- **Final Appeal:** Don't ignore the evidence. Let the creation lead you to
  worship the Creator. Choose faith grounded in the clear testimony God has
  provided.
