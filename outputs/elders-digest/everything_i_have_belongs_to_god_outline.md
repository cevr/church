### Introduction (5 min)
*   **Hook:** Start with a common scenario - receiving a paycheck or managing resources. Where does our thinking usually start? `(RQ)`
*   **Broaden Definition:** Stewardship isn't just about money jars. It's about managing *everything* God entrusts to us.
*   **Central Idea:** Introduce the foundational truth - God is the ultimate owner.
    *   Read **Psalm 24:1**. `[Whiteboard: Psalm 24:1 - The Earth is the LORD'S]`
*   **Roadmap:** Briefly state the study will explore what it means to live recognizing God's total ownership.

### Biblical Foundation: God's Ownership & Our Role (12 min)
*   **God Owns Everything (Recap Psalm 24:1):**
    *   If God owns it all, what does that make us? (Managers, stewards, caretakers).
*   **The Steward's Requirement (1 Cor 4:2):**
    *   Read **1 Corinthians 4:2**. "Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."
    *   `[Whiteboard: Steward = Manager; Required = Faithful]`
    *   What does faithfulness look like in a manager? `(RQ)` (Honesty, diligence, using resources according to owner's wishes).
    *   `[Analogy: Think of a property manager. They don't own the building, but they are responsible for its upkeep, collecting rent, and handling repairs according to the owner's instructions. Faithfulness means they act in the owner's best interest, not their own.]`
*   **Accountability for All Gifts (Matt 25:14-30 - Parable of Talents):**
    *   Briefly summarize the parable.
    *   Key points:
        *   Master gave talents *according to ability* (v. 15).
        *   Expected stewards to *use* what was given (v. 16-18).
        *   Accountability was required (v. 19).
        *   Faithfulness (even with little) was rewarded; negligence was condemned (v. 21, 23, 26-30).
    *   `[Whiteboard: Talents = Time, Abilities, Influence, Resources, Spiritual Gifts]`
    *   `[Concept (from parable): God expects growth/return on His investments in us.]`
    *   This applies to *everything* He gives, not just money.

### Unpacking Stewardship: Beyond Money [*] (15 min)
*   **Stewardship of Gifts & Service (1 Peter 4:10):**
    *   Read **1 Peter 4:10**. "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."
    *   Connects receiving gifts (talents, spiritual abilities) directly to serving others.
    *   `[Whiteboard: Stewardship = ALL of Life (Time, Talents, Temple, Treasure)]`
    *   Spiritual service and using God-given power can have eternal impact far beyond material wealth. How does this shift our priorities? `(RQ)`
*   **The Place of Finances (Malachi 3:8-10):**
    *   Read **Malachi 3:8-10**. Address the direct question: "Will a man rob God?"
    *   Define Tithe (10%) as God's specified portion – returning what is His.
        *   `[Whiteboard: Tithe (10%) = God's Reserved Portion]`
    *   Define Offerings as expressions of gratitude and love, given *beyond* the tithe.
        *   `[Whiteboard: Offerings = Freewill Response to Grace]`
    *   Note the connection between faithfulness here and God's blessing (v. 10). This isn't transactional prosperity gospel, but God honoring trust and obedience.
    *   Money *is* necessary and important for advancing God's organized work on earth (supporting ministry, missions, infrastructure).
    *   `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]`
*   **Faithfulness with Resources (Luke 16:10-13):**
    *   Briefly reference the principle: Faithful in little (earthly wealth) -> Faithful in much (true riches). Using 'unrighteous mammon' wisely.
    *   How we handle finances reveals our heart's allegiance (v. 13 - Cannot serve God and Mammon).

### Practical Application: Character & Commitment (8 min)
*   **Total Commitment - You Belong to God (1 Cor 6:19-20):**
    *   Read **1 Corinthians 6:19-20**. "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
    *   `[Aside: That 'price' mentioned in 1 Cor 6:20 isn't just a metaphor; it refers to the infinite cost of Christ's sacrifice on Calvary. Recognizing this deepens our understanding of why we belong wholly to Him.]`
    *   The ultimate stewardship: Ourselves. If we belong to God, *everything* we have is His.
    *   `[Whiteboard: YOU belong to God -> ALL you have/are belongs to God]`
    *   True stewardship = total surrender.
*   **Character Reflection - Overcoming Selfishness:**
    *   Faithful stewardship is an antidote to materialism and selfishness (Ref. Luke 12:15 - Rich Fool).
    *   It develops liberality, trust, and a focus on eternal values.
    *   How does viewing everything as God's change how we acquire, save, and spend? `(RQ)`
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from Texts):**
    *   **Acknowledge:** Consciously acknowledge God's ownership daily (Psalm 24:1). `[Whiteboard: Action 1: Daily Acknowledgment]`
    *   **Assess:** Prayerfully evaluate how you use *all* resources (time, talents, money) for His glory (Matt 25, 1 Pet 4:10). `[Whiteboard: Action 2: Prayerful Assessment]`
    *   **Act:** Commit to faithfulness in tithe/offerings (Mal 3:10) and using gifts in service (1 Pet 4:10). `[Whiteboard: Action 3: Faithful Action (Giving & Serving)]`
*   **Ellen G. White Perspective:**
    *   "God entrusts men with means; but it is that they may glorify Him in the judicious use of these talents... He is testing the character..." (Paraphrased concept from *Our High Calling*, p. 192). Stewardship is a character test.

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
*   **Recap:** God owns everything (Ps 24:1). We are stewards required to be faithful (1 Cor 4:2). This covers our whole life – time, talents, resources, ourselves (1 Pet 4:10, 1 Cor 6:19-20). Faithful stewardship develops Christlike character.
*   **Simplicity Revealed:** The core truth often missed: It's not *our* money/time/talent we give to God; it's *His* we are managing for Him.
*   **Appeal:** Invitation to embrace the role of a faithful steward. Surrender all areas to His lordship. Commit to managing His resources according to His will, reflecting His character.
*   **Closing Thought:** Reiterate **Psalm 24:1**. May we live joyfully and faithfully as managers in the Owner's world.
