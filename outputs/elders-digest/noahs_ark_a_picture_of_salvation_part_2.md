### Introduction (5 min)

- Brief recap: Part 1 established the context - widespread wickedness (**Gen
  6:5, 11-12**), God's sorrow (**Gen 6:6**), Noah's faithfulness (**Gen 6:9**).
- Focus for Part 2: The Ark not just as a vessel, but a profound symbol of God's
  plan of salvation through Christ amidst judgment.
  `[Write on board: Ark = Salvation in Christ]`
- Introduce Central Verse: **Genesis 7:16** - The culmination of entry and the
  divine act of closure. This verse highlights both obedience and divine
  security.
- **(RQ)** What deeper lessons does the Ark's story hold for us facing the end
  times, especially regarding God's provision and the close of opportunity?

### Section 1: Judgment Decreed, Grace Provided (10 min)

- **God's Limit on Sin:**
  - Persistent rebellion grieves God's heart (**Gen 6:5-6**). The depth of sin
    required a divine response. `[Write on board: Gen 6:5-6 - God's Grief]`
  - Divine patience has limits; a period of probation is set: **Gen 6:3** ("My
    spirit shall not always strive with man... yet his days shall be an hundred
    and twenty years"). `[Write on board: Gen 6:3 - 120 Years Probation]`
  - Judgment becomes the necessary, though sorrowful, outcome: **Gen 6:7** ("And
    the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I have created...").
- **Grace Amidst Judgment:**
  - Even in declaring judgment, God provides a specific way of escape (The Ark -
    **Gen 6:14**).
  - This escape is rooted in grace: **Gen 6:8** ("But Noah found grace in the
    eyes of the Lord."). Salvation begins with God's unmerited favor.
    `[Write on board: Gen 6:8 - Grace Found]`
  - **(Illustration/Analogy):** Like a loving parent who must enforce
    consequences for dangerous behavior but simultaneously provides a safe room
    or clear path away from the danger if the child will only take it. The
    consequence is real, but the offer of safety is also real.
  - `[Aside: The 120 years mentioned in Gen 6:3 is often understood by SDAs not as a shortened human lifespan from that point, but as the specific period of final probation given to the antediluvian world before the Flood came.]`
  - **(RQ)** How does seeing both God's judgment and His provision of grace in
    **Genesis 6** shape our understanding of His character?

### Section 2: The Ark - God's Refuge, Christ Typified (12 min)

- **God's Specific Instructions (Gen 6:14-16, 22):** The detailed plans
  (materials, dimensions, structure) emphasize that salvation is according to
  _God's_ design, not human invention. Noah's obedience (**Gen 6:22**) was key.
- **One Ark, One Way of Salvation:**
  - There was only _one_ Ark provided for physical salvation from the flood.
  - This points directly to Christ as the _only_ way for spiritual salvation:
    **John 14:6** ("I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto
    the Father, but by me.")
    `[Write on board: One Ark -> One Christ (John 14:6)]`
  - Reinforced by **Acts 4:12** ("Neither is there salvation in any other: for
    there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be
    saved.").
- **Safety Inside the Ark (Christ):**
  - Entry into the Ark meant safety from the coming judgment (**Gen 7:7,
    13-15**).
  - Being "in Christ" means safety from the condemnation of sin (**Romans
    8:1**).
  - The ultimate security is God-given: "...and the Lord shut him in." (**Gen
    7:16b**). Those in Christ are kept by God's power.
- **Saved Through Water (Typology):**
  - **1 Peter 3:20-21** explicitly draws the parallel: The Ark saved Noah's
    family _through_ the water. The water brought judgment to the world but bore
    up the Ark.
  - This prefigures baptism, which saves us "by the resurrection of Jesus
    Christ," signifying death to sin and rising to new life in Him.
    `[Write on board: 1 Peter 3:20-21 - Water: Judgment / Salvation]`
  - **(RQ)** How does understanding the Ark as a type of Christ deepen our
    appreciation for what Jesus accomplished?

### Section 3: The Open & Shut Door - Probation's Lesson [*] (12 min)

- **The Invitation Period (Probation):**
  - The 120 years (**Gen 6:3**) and Noah's role as a "preacher of righteousness"
    (**2 Peter 2:5**) represent the time the door of the Ark (God's mercy) was
    open.
  - People had ample opportunity to heed the warning and enter.
- **Entering the Ark (Responding to the Call):**
  - Faithful obedience led Noah and his family inside (**Gen 7:7, 9, 13-15**).
    They acted on God's word.
- **God Shuts the Door (Probation Closes):**
  - The decisive moment: "...and the Lord shut him in." (**Gen 7:16b**). This
    was a divine act, sealing the fate of those outside. It marked the absolute
    end of opportunity for the antediluvian world.
    `[Write on board: Gen 7:16b - God Shut the Door = Probation Closed]`
  - `[Aside: The concept of a "shut door" became significant in early Adventist understanding following the Great Disappointment of 1844, relating to Christ's ministry moving from the Holy to the Most Holy Place in the heavenly sanctuary, signifying a new phase of ministry before the close of probation.]`
- **Parallel to End Times:**
  - Jesus explicitly connects this event to the time before His return:
    **Matthew 24:37-39**. Life seemed normal, people ignored the signs, "until
    the flood came and took them all away."
  - This warns against spiritual complacency and presumption. The end of
    opportunity will come, perhaps unexpectedly for many.
- **Application Framework:**
  - **Need/Question (from text):** Seeing the finality of the shut door (**Gen
    7:16b**) and the suddenness of judgment despite warnings (**Matt
    24:37-39**), how do we ensure we are safe _before_ our personal or
    collective opportunity ends?
  - **Biblical Principle (from text):** Salvation is found only by entering
    God's provided refuge (the Ark/Christ) during the time of invitation (**Gen
    7:7; John 14:6; Acts 4:12**). Probation, the time of opportunity, has a
    definite end, determined by God (**Gen 7:16b; Rev 22:11**).
  - **Bridging (from text):** Just as the physical door of the Ark eventually
    closed, the Bible teaches that the door of human probation will close before
    Christ's second coming. Our "ark" today is Jesus Christ, and the invitation
    to enter into His salvation is open _now_ through His grace. We must respond
    while the door is open.
  - **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Acknowledge & Enter:** Consciously accept Jesus Christ as your _only_
        refuge and Savior (**Acts 4:12; John 14:6**). Have you personally
        "entered the ark"?
    2.  **Respond Urgently:** Don't delay responding to the Holy Spirit's call,
        unlike those in Noah's day (**Heb 3:15; Matt 24:38-39**). Treat God's
        invitation seriously _today_.
    3.  **Warn & Invite:** Share the message of salvation and the warning of
        judgment with others, following Noah's example as a "preacher of
        righteousness" (**2 Peter 2:5; Matt 28:19-20**).
  - **Invitation:** Today, the door of salvation in Christ stands open. Have you
    entered? If not, choose now to accept God's gracious provision before the
    door is shut. If you are inside, are you inviting others in?

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Reiterate Central Verse: **Genesis 7:16** - God Himself secures those who
  respond to His call and enter His provided refuge.
- Summarize key types: Ark = Christ (our only safety - **Acts 4:12**); Flood =
  Judgment to come; Shut Door = Close of Probation (**Matt 24:37-39**).
- Emphasize the dual reality: judgment is certain for sin, but salvation is
  freely offered in Christ (**1 Peter 3:20-21**).
- Final Appeal: Based on the urgency highlighted by the shut door and the
  sufficiency found only in Christ. Urge a personal decision to enter the Ark of
  safety _now_.
- Closing Hymn: #294 "Power in the Blood"
