### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: We evaluate investments by their 'profit' or ROI. What is the spiritual
  ROI of engaging with the Holy Scriptures? **(RQ)**

  God's Word.

  believer.
- [Write on board: Title & Central Verse: 2 Tim 3:16-17 - PROFITABLE]

### Main Content Section 1: The Equipping Ministry of Scripture (12 min)

- Scripture equips us for essential aspects of the Christian life.
- **1. Equipping for Saving Faith:**
  - "Able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ
    Jesus" (2 Tim 3:15).
  - How does Scripture accomplish this? (Rom 10:17 - Faith comes by hearing
    God's Word). **(RQ)**
  - It reveals our need and God's provision in Christ.
  - [Write on board: Equipping: 1. Saving Faith (2 Tim 3:15; Rom 10:17)]
- **2. Equipping for Serving Faith (Requires Diligence):**
  - "Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be
    ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 Tim 2:15).
  - What does 'rightly dividing' (cutting straight) mean in practice? (Accurate
    understanding and application, avoiding distortion). **(RQ)** [Whiteboard:
    'Rightly Dividing' (2 Tim 2:15) = Accurate Handling]
  - Why is diligent study vital for effective service? (Ensures faithfulness to
    God's message, avoids misleading others). **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Equipping: 2. Serving Faith (Study - 2 Tim 2:15)]
- **3. Equipping for Spiritual Warfare:**
  - "Take... the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God" (Eph 6:17).
  - How is the Word our spiritual weapon? (Used by Christ against temptation -
    Matt 4:1-11; Defends against deception, pierces falsehood). **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Equipping: 3. Spiritual Warfare (Eph 6:17; Matt 4)]
  - [Aside: Like a soldier needing their weapon, we cannot face spiritual
    battles unarmed. The Bible isn't just a comfort; it's our essential defense
    and offense provided by the Spirit.]

### Main Content Section 2: The Enabling Ministry of Scripture [*] (10 min)

- Scripture doesn't just equip, it _enables_ spiritual life and action.
- **1. Enabling Spiritual Growth ('Wise'):**
  - Beyond initial salvation, Scripture imparts wisdom for life (2 Tim 3:15).
  - How does the Word provide daily guidance and wisdom? (Ps 119:105 - A lamp
    and light; Prov 9:10 - Foundation of wisdom). **(RQ)**
  - Requires abiding in the Word (John 15:7 - If my words abide in you...).
    Growth comes through internalizing truth.
  - [Write on board: Enabling: 1. Spiritual Growth (Wisdom - Ps 119:105; John
    15:7)]
- **2. Enabling Spiritual Action ('Good Works'):**
  - Goal: "Throughly furnished unto all good works" (2 Tim 3:17).
  - We are "created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before
    ordained that we should walk in them" (Eph 2:10).
  - How does Scripture enable these works? (Reveals God's will, motivates by His
    love, empowers through His Spirit working with the Word). **(RQ)**
  - [Write on board: Enabling: 2. Spiritual Action (Good Works - 2 Tim 3:17; Eph
    2:10)]
  - [Analogy (from Eph 2:10): Like a tool designed for a purpose, we are God's
    workmanship, equipped by His Word for the specific good works He prepared
    for us.]

### Main Content Section 3: The Enlightening Ministry of Scripture (12 min)

- Focus on the four specific 'profits' listed in 2 Timothy 3:16.
- [Write on board: Enlightening (2 Tim 3:16): Doctrine | Reproof | Correction |
  Instruction]
- **1. Doctrine (Teaching):** What is true? Foundational beliefs.
  - Provides the solid ground of truth (Titus 1:9).
  - Why is correct doctrine essential? (Guards against error, shapes worldview
    and practice). **(RQ)**
- **2. Reproof (Conviction/Testing):** Where am I wrong?
  - The Word exposes sin and error in our lives (Heb 4:12 - discerner of
    thoughts/intents).
  - How does Scripture act as a mirror? (Shows us reality against God's
    standard). **(RQ)**
- **3. Correction (Restoration):** How to get right?
  - Guides us back to God's path when we stray (Ps 119:9, 11 - Cleansing way by
    Word).
  - It's not just pointing out wrong, but pointing the way back.
  - [Write on board: Correction = Restoration to God's Way (Ps 119:9)]
- **4. Instruction in Righteousness (Cultivating Virtue):** How to stay right
  and grow?
  - Training in how to live according to God's will.
  - Purpose: "That the man of God may be perfect (complete, mature)" (2 Tim
    3:17). Making us 'more like Him'.
  - This involves cultivating the soul through consistent application.
  - [Write on board: Instruction -> Righteousness -> Completeness (2 Tim 3:17)]
  - [Aside: Just as a garden needs tending – weeding (reproof), straightening
    plants (correction), and nourishing (instruction) – our souls need the
    constant application of Scripture to bear the fruit of righteousness.]
- **Crucial Caveat:** Accurate Application.
  - Revisit: "Rightly dividing the word of truth" (2 Tim 2:15).
  - Warning against twisting Scripture (2 Pet 3:16).
  - How do we ensure accuracy? (Prayer, context, comparing Scripture with
    Scripture, humility, guidance of Holy Spirit). **(RQ)**

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Scripture is profoundly _profitable_ – it equips us (faith,
  service, warfare), enables us (growth, works), and enlightens us (doctrine,
  reproof, correction, instruction).
- **The Goal:** God's Word aims to make us complete, mature, fully equipped
  followers of Christ (2 Tim 3:17).
- **Challenge:** Are we merely _possessing_ Bibles, or are we _profiting_ from
  the Word through diligent study and application? **(RQ)**
- **Practical Steps:**
  - Commit to daily time in the Word, praying for understanding (Heb 4:12, Ps
    119:18).
  - Ask:
    1.  _Where does God want to teach me (doctrine) through this passage?_ (2
        Tim 3:16a)
    2.  _Is there anything in my life this passage reproves or corrects?_ (2 Tim
        3:16b; Heb 4:12)
    3.  _How can I apply this instruction in righteousness today to become
        better equipped for His service?_ (2 Tim 3:16c-17; Eph 2:10)
- **Invitation:** Let us commit to engaging with God's Word not as a mere duty,
  but as the source of divine profit that transforms us and equips us for every
  good work He has prepared.
