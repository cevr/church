### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** What does it _really_ mean to be called 'Christian'? Is it just a
  label, or something deeper?
- Brief overview: The early church in Acts wasn't perfect, but it was dynamic,
  Spirit-led, and world-changing. They were first called 'Christians' in Antioch
  (Acts 11:26b).
- **Central Question:** What characteristics defined this early church, and how
  can we embody them today? **(RQ)**
- **Thesis:** A true Christian church is founded on the Holy Spirit's work,
  breaks down human barriers, focuses on mission, practices generosity, resolves
  conflict biblically, and keeps Christ central.
- `[Write on board: Title - The Church Called Christian (Acts 11:26b)]`

### Section 1: The Spirit's Unpredictable Foundation (8 min)

- **The Need:** Churches can become rigid, relying on human plans over Divine
  guidance.
- **Biblical Principle:** The church's origin and growth are rooted in the Holy
  Spirit's initiative.
  - Scattering led to unexpected outreach (Acts 11:19).
  - Preaching to Gentiles (Greeks) - breaking tradition (Acts 11:20).
  - "The hand of the Lord was with them" - Divine power, not human strategy
    alone (Acts 11:21).
    `[Whiteboard: Acts 11:21 - Hand of the Lord = Spirit's Power]`
  - Result: "a great number believed and turned to the Lord." (Acts 11:21b).
- **Bridging:** How open are we to the Spirit leading in ways we don't expect?
  **(RQ)** Do our church structures sometimes hinder rather than facilitate His
  work?
- **Action:** Pray specifically for the Spirit's guidance _before_ making plans.
  Be open to unexpected opportunities for witness.

### Section 2: Breaking Barriers & Building Faith (10 min) [*]

- **The Need:** Prejudice (racial, national, social) constantly threatens church
  unity and witness.
- **Biblical Principle:** The Spirit creates inclusivity and empowers leaders to
  nurture faith.
  - **Inclusivity:** Preaching to the Hellenists/Greeks (Acts 11:20) - a radical
    step beyond Jewish boundaries. `[Whiteboard: Acts 11:20 -> Gospel for ALL]`
  - **Spirit-filled Leadership (Barnabas):**
    - Sent to investigate, not control (Acts 11:22).
    - _Saw_ the grace of God and _was glad_ (Acts 11:23a). Leaders rejoice in
      God's work, wherever it happens.
    - _Encouraged_ them to remain faithful ("cleave unto the Lord") (Acts
      11:23b). Focus on heart-connection to Christ.
    - Character: "good man, full of the Holy Ghost and of faith" (Acts 11:24a).
      `[Whiteboard: Leadership Qualities (Acts 11:24): Goodness + Spirit + Faith]`
    - Result: "much people was added unto the Lord" (Acts 11:24b).
- **Bridging:** Does our church actively break down barriers? **(RQ)** How can
  leaders better encourage genuine faithfulness rather than just external
  compliance?
- `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies, our churches should represent the inclusive Kingdom of Heaven, not the divisions of the world around us.]`
- **Action:** Intentionally connect with someone in church from a different
  background. Encourage leaders who demonstrate Barnabas's qualities (Acts
  11:24a).

### Section 3: Marks of a Spirit-Led Community (12 min)

- **The Need:** Churches can become inwardly focused, neglecting mission and
  practical care.
- **Biblical Principle:** The Spirit prompts outward mission, practical
  generosity, warm fellowship, and guided conflict resolution.
  - **World Mission Focus (Acts 13:1-4):**
    - Diverse leadership team praying/fasting (Acts 13:1-2a).
    - Holy Spirit _directly_ calls and sends workers: "Separate me Barnabas and
      Saul for the work whereunto I have called them." (Acts 13:2b).
      `[Write on board: Acts 13:2 - Spirit -> Mission Call]`
    - Church confirms and sends willingly (Acts 13:3).
    - "So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed..." (Acts 13:4a).
    - `[Illustration: Like a skilled navigator (the Holy Spirit) giving precise directions to the ship's captain (the church leadership) for a vital voyage (mission).]`
    - **(RQ)** Does our church see sending missionaries (local/global) as a
      primary Spirit-led function?
  - **Generosity (Acts 11:27-30):**
    - Spirit reveals future need via prophecy (Acts 11:27-28).
    - Disciples determine to send relief "every man according to his ability"
      (Acts 11:29). Practical, proportional giving.
    - Sent to brethren in Judea - care for the wider church family (Acts 11:30).
    - `[Analogy (from Acts 11:29): Generosity as a thermometer of spiritual health – it reveals the warmth of our love for God and others.]`
  - **Fellowship (Implied):** The context of Acts (gathering, teaching,
    praying - e.g., Acts 2:42) implies warm, heavenly fellowship. This is where
    encouragement (Acts 11:23b) happens.
  - **Conflict Resolution (Acts 15:6-12, 28):** [*]
    - Open discussion, testimony of God's work (Peter - Acts 15:7-11),
      Barnabas/Paul (Acts 15:12).
    - Submission to Spirit-led counsel: "For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost,
      and to us..." (Acts 15:28a).
      `[Whiteboard: Acts 15:28 - Spirit + Counsel = Resolution]`
    - Focus on essentials, avoiding unnecessary burdens (Acts 15:28b-29).
- **Bridging:** How does our church budget/activity reflect a mission focus
  (Acts 13:2-4)? How readily do we practice sacrificial giving for others' needs
  (Acts 11:29)? How do we handle disagreements (Acts 15:28)?
- **Action:** Support the church's mission fund. Look for a practical need to
  meet this week. Practice seeking Spirit-led counsel in disagreements.

### Section 4: Christ at the Center (5 min)

- **The Need:** Churches can talk _about_ many things, but lose focus on Christ
  Himself.
- **Biblical Principle:** Being 'Christian' means Christ is the central theme
  and model.
  - Called 'Christians' first in Antioch (Acts 11:26b). Why there? Perhaps
    because their lives and teaching clearly revolved around Christ.
  - **EGW Insight:** Reflecting Ellen White's emphasis, the name 'Christian'
    signifies that Christ is the believer's all-encompassing theme – the focus
    of thought, conversation, and teaching. True Christians seek to reflect His
    life and character.
  - **EGW Insight:** Echoing Ellen White's perspective, the church is God's
    chosen agency, a unified body where individuals cooperate _with_ Christ as
    the head, working together for His purposes.
- **Bridging:** If someone observed our church for a month, would
  'Christ-centered' be the obvious description? **(RQ)** Is He the main theme of
  our conversations, plans, and worship (Acts 11:26b)?
- `[Aside: Instead of just cultural traditions, we can use every opportunity, like seasons or events, to intentionally point people to Christ's love and truth. It's about redeeming the time for His glory (cf. Eph 5:16).]`
- **Action:** Intentionally make Christ the focus of a conversation this week.
  Evaluate personal/church activities: Does this point to Christ?

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** Recap the key marks: Spirit-led foundation (Acts 11:21),
  inclusivity (Acts 11:20), encouraging leadership (Acts 11:23-24), mission
  focus (Acts 13:2), generosity (Acts 11:29), guided conflict resolution (Acts
  15:28), and Christ-centeredness (Acts 11:26b).
- **The Simplicity:** At its core, being a 'Christian' church isn't about
  complex programs, but about individuals filled with the Spirit (Acts 11:24a),
  connected to Christ (Acts 11:23b), loving each other practically (Acts 11:29),
  and sharing Him with the world (Acts 13:2-4).
- **Challenge:** Are we content with the label 'Christian', or do we desire the
  Spirit-filled reality seen in Acts?
- **Invitation:** Let's commit to seeking the Holy Spirit's power daily,
  allowing Him to shape us individually and corporately into the church He calls
  us to be – truly 'Christian'. Pray for a fresh outpouring of the Spirit.
- Final thought: Reflect on Acts 11:24a - being "a good man, full of the Holy
  Ghost and of faith." May this be our individual and collective testimony.
