### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce Theme: God's unwavering commitment to completing His work in His
  children.
- Read Central Verse: Philippians 1:6.
- **RQ:** Have you ever felt overwhelmed by a personal project, doubting its
  completion? How does this compare to God's project of restoring His image in
  us?
- Overview: Explore God's initiating love, His sanctifying process, and His
  promise of completion.
- [Write on board: Philippians 1:6 - God *WILL* Finish His Work]

### Section 1: God's Seeking Love - The Foundation (10 min)

- Focus: God initiates and establishes the relationship through His persistent,
  costly love.
- **God's Persistent Search (Luke 15:8-9):**
  - Read Luke 15:8-9. The woman's diligent search for one lost coin.
  - **RQ:** What does the intensity of her search reveal about God's value for
    each individual soul? (Luke 15:8-9)
  - [Whiteboard: Luke 15:8-9 -> God *Seeks* Us Diligently]
  - Point: Our belonging stems from _His_ initiative; He sought and found us.
- **God's Costly Commitment (Romans 8:31-32):**
  - Read Romans 8:31-32. The ultimate price paid – His own Son.
  - **RQ:** If God demonstrated such immense love by giving His Son while we
    were still sinners (Rom 5:8), how certain can we be of His commitment to us
    now as His children? (Rom 8:32)
  - [Whiteboard: Rom 8:32 -> Costly Love = Unfailing Commitment]
  - Point: God's past sacrifice is the ultimate guarantee of His future
    faithfulness. He is fully invested in our salvation.
- [Aside: Think of the value placed on a lost heirloom. We are God's treasured
  possession, sought at infinite cost. His desire isn't just to find us, but to
  restore us fully to His image.]

### Section 2: God's Ongoing Work - Sanctification [*] (12 min)

- Focus: Understanding sanctification as God's continuous work of
  transformation.
- **God's Purpose - Wholeness (1 Thessalonians 5:23-24):**
  - Read 1 Thess 5:23-24. God's desire: complete sanctification (spirit, soul,
    body).
  - Point: Sanctification is not primarily our achievement, but _God's_ active
    work _within_ us.
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Thess 5:23 -> Sanctification = God's Work (Spirit, Soul,
    Body)]
  - **RQ:** What does being preserved "blameless" imply? Human perfection, or a
    state of faithful reliance and dependence on God's grace? (1 Thess 5:23)
  - Point: The One who calls is faithful; _He_ will accomplish it (v. 24). Our
    role is surrender and cooperation.
- **Our Role - Cooperation:**
  - Point: We must yield to His process, allowing Him to change, mold, and work.
    (Concept from Jeremiah 18:1-6).
  - **RQ:** In what areas might we be resisting God's shaping hand, hindering
    His sanctifying work described in 1 Thess 5:23-24?
  - [Brief Analogy (from Jer 18): Clay on the potter's wheel – are we pliable or
    resistant to the Master's touch?]
- **The Source of True Change (Galatians 5:22-23):**
  - Reference Galatians 5:22-23. The fruit (love, joy, peace...) originates from
    the _Spirit_.
  - Point: Genuine character transformation is not born of self-effort but is
    the natural result of the Holy Spirit's indwelling presence.
  - [Whiteboard: Gal 5:22-23 -> Fruit = Evidence of God's Spirit, NOT
    Self-Effort]
  - **RQ:** Are our efforts focused on manufacturing spiritual fruit, or on
    abiding in Christ (John 15:4-5), allowing His Spirit to produce His fruit
    _through_ us?

### Section 3: Perseverance and God's Perspective (12 min)

- Focus: Navigating failures in the Christian walk and understanding God's basis
  for evaluation.
- **God's Evaluation - The Heart's Allegiance:**
  - Point: God assesses based on the heart's underlying love and commitment, not
    merely on outward performance or worldly success. (Ref. 1 Samuel 16:7).
  - **RQ:** How does the truth that God sees the heart (1 Sam 16:7) liberate us
    from performance-based religion and fear of judgment based on temporary
    setbacks?
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Sam 16:7 -> God Sees the HEART (Love & Commitment)]
- **Failure as Part of the Process:**
  - Point: Spiritual growth involves setbacks. Failure is not final defeat if we
    return to God. Peter's denial (Luke 22:31-34, 54-62) followed by restoration
    (John 21:15-19).
  - [Brief Biblical Example: Peter's journey illustrates that failure, when met
    with repentance, can precede greater usefulness.]
  - **RQ:** How can our failures, viewed through God's grace (Prov 24:16),
    become opportunities for deeper dependence and growth?
- **The Key to Endurance (Hebrews 12:1-2):**
  - Read Hebrews 12:1-2. Run the race with patience, _looking unto Jesus_.
  - Point: Perseverance is fueled by maintaining focus on Christ, the
    _Originator_ and _Perfecter_ of our faith.
  - [Whiteboard: Heb 12:1-2 -> Focus on JESUS = Author & FINISHER]
  - Point: His endurance through suffering assures us of His understanding and
    His power to sustain us.
- [Aside: Our spiritual journey is more like a marathon than a sprint. There
  will be hills and valleys, moments of fatigue. But the finish line isn't based
  on our perfect stride, but on keeping our eyes fixed on the One who guarantees
  our arrival if we don't give up.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Reiterate Central Verse: Philippians 1:6. Anchor confidence in God's
  faithfulness.
- Summary: God initiated our salvation with seeking love (Luke 15), secured it
  at great cost (Rom 8), actively works to sanctify us (1 Thess 5), produces His
  character in us (Gal 5), understands our struggles and focuses on the heart (1
  Sam 16, Heb 12).
- **The Need/Question:** Do doubts arise about God finishing His work in _you_,
  especially during times of failure or slow progress? **(RQ)**
- **The Biblical Principle/Solution:** God's promise in Philippians 1:6 is
  steadfast. He is both the Author _and_ the Finisher (Heb 12:2). His
  faithfulness ensures the completion of His work in those who remain yielded (1
  Thess 5:24).
- **Bridging to Practice:** Trusting this promise involves daily cooperation,
  rising after falls (Prov 24:16), and consistently refocusing on Jesus (Heb
  12:2).
- **Actionable Steps (derived from texts):**
  - 1.  **Recall His Pursuit:** When discouraged, consciously remember God's
        diligent, loving search for you (Luke 15:8-9). [Whiteboard: Action 1:
        Remember God's Search (Lk 15)]
  - 2.  **Yield Daily:** Begin each day surrendering to God's sanctifying work,
        asking Him to shape you (1 Thess 5:23). [Whiteboard: Action 2: Yield
        Daily (1 Thess 5)]
  - 3.  **Refocus Immediately:** When you stumble or feel weak, turn your gaze
        immediately back to Jesus, the Finisher of your faith (Heb 12:2).
        [Whiteboard: Action 3: Refocus on Jesus (Heb 12)]
- **Invitation:** Will you choose to believe God's promise today? Will you
  actively cooperate with His transforming work, trusting His power and
  faithfulness to complete what He has begun in you? Let's commit to this trust.
