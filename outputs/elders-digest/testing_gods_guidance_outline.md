### Introduction: The Need for Discernment (6 min)
-   The Reality: God *desires* to guide His children (Prov 3:6).
-   The Danger: Not every voice or impulse is from God (1 John 4:1).
    -   Satan as deceiver (2 Cor 11:14).
    -   Our own desires can mislead (Jer 17:9).
-   The Goal: To confidently discern and follow God's *true* leading.
    -   [Write on board: 1 John 4:1 - TEST the Spirits]
    -   Why is testing so crucial in the last days? **(RQ)**

### Section 1: The Unchanging Standards - Word & Spirit (10 min)
-   **Foundation 1: God's Word**
    -   The ultimate, objective standard (Psalm 119:105).
        -   [Write on board: Ps 119:105 - Word = Lamp & Light]
        -   How does Scripture illuminate our path practically? **(RQ)**
    -   Any true guidance will *always* harmonize with Scripture (Isa 8:20).
    -   Need for diligent study, not just proof-texting (2 Tim 2:15).
-   **Foundation 2: The Holy Spirit**
    -   Promised Guide into *all truth* (John 16:13).
        -   [Write on board: John 16:13 - Spirit -> All Truth (Consistent w/ Word)]
    -   The Spirit illuminates the Word, applies it personally.
    -   He convicts of sin, righteousness, judgment (John 16:8) - aligning us with God's will.
    -   How do we distinguish the Spirit's voice from other influences? **(RQ)** (Hint: Alignment with Scripture is key).

### Section 2: The Internal Compass - Mind & Conscience [*] (8 min)
-   **The Renewed Mind:**
    -   Transformation needed to discern God's will (Romans 12:2).
        -   [Write on board: Rom 12:2 - Renewed Mind -> Discerns God's Will]
    -   Requires surrender, prayer, feeding on truth.
    -   Common sense aligned with biblical principles (Titus 2:12 - live soberly/sensibly).
-   **The Informed Conscience:**
    -   Conscience as a God-given faculty (Rom 2:14-15).
    -   *Must* be informed and calibrated by God's Word (Acts 24:16, Rom 9:1).
        -   [Write: Conscience + Word = Reliable Guide (often)]
    -   Caution: Conscience can be weak, seared, or misinformed (1 Cor 8:7, 1 Tim 4:2). It's not infallible alone.
    -   When might 'common sense' or conscience lead us astray if not grounded in Scripture? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: External Confirmations - Counsel & Circumstances (8 min)
-   **Godly Counsel:**
    -   Safety in a multitude of *godly* counselors (Proverbs 11:14, 15:22).
        -   [Write on board: Prov 11:14 - Safety in Godly Counsel]
    -   Seek advice from mature believers grounded in the Word (Col 3:16).
    -   [Aside: Our church communities should function like spiritual embassiesâ€”places where heavenly wisdom and counsel, grounded in Scripture, are readily available to help navigate earthly challenges.]
    -   Not seeking validation, but wisdom and perspective.
-   **Providential Circumstances:**
    -   God can open and close doors (Rev 3:8).
    -   *Use with caution* - circumstances are the *weakest* test alone.
        -   Satan can manipulate circumstances (Job 1).
        -   Difficulty doesn't always mean 'no'; ease doesn't always mean 'yes'.
    -   Must align with Scripture, Spirit, Counsel.
    -   [Analogy: Circumstances like road signs - helpful, but need a map (Bible) to know if you're on the right road.]
    -   How can we avoid misinterpreting circumstances? **(RQ)** (Check against other tests).

### Section 4: The Ultimate Test - Obedience & Fruit (8 min)
-   **Walking in the Light:**
    -   Obedience to *known* truth is essential (Eph 5:8-10).
        -   [Write on board: Eph 5:8-10 - Walk in Light -> Discern Lord's Will]
    -   God reveals more light as we walk faithfully in what we already know.
    -   Guidance often comes step-by-step, not the whole map at once.
-   **Testing the Fruit:**
    -   True guidance leads to Christ-like character and fruit (Matt 7:16-20, Gal 5:22-23).
        -   [Write: Test the Fruit (Matt 7:16) -> Character, Alignment w/ God]
    -   Does the potential path promote love, joy, peace, faithfulness, obedience? **(RQ)**
    -   Does it lead to compromising biblical principles? (Red flag!)
-   **Reproving Darkness:**
    -   Our tested, godly choices become a witness (Eph 5:11).
    -   Living out God's guidance reproves the works of darkness.
    -   [Aside: Sometimes God allows us to navigate complex 'worldly' situations, not to adopt their methods, but to demonstrate His way. Like using a found coin from a worldly system for God's kingdom, we use discernment to act righteously within challenging circumstances.]
