### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Significance of godly motherhood in shaping individuals and society.
- Introduce Proverbs 31: Not a checklist for exhaustion, but a portrait of
  God-enabled character potential.
- Central Theme: God's ideal for mothers is rooted in character developed
  through a relationship with Him.
- **(RQ)** How does the world often portray motherhood compared to the depth
  shown in Proverbs 31?
- [Write on board: Proverbs 31 = Portrait of Godly Character]

### The Virtuous Mother: Character in Action (Prov 31) (12 min)

- Focus: Exploring key traits from Prov 31 as tangible expressions of godly
  character.
- **Trustworthiness (v. 11-12):** Her husband has full confidence in her. She
  brings him good, not harm. Creates security.
  - `[Whiteboard: Trustworthy (Prov 31:11-12)]`
  - **(RQ)** Based on these verses, what actions build trust within the family?
- **Benevolence & Compassion (v. 20):** "She stretcheth out her hand to the
  poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy." Reflects God's own
  heart.
  - `[Whiteboard: Compassion (Prov 31:20)]`
  - Practical Application: Seeing and responding to needs beyond the immediate
    family.
- **Industry & Diligence (v. 13, 15, 27):** Works eagerly, manages household
  well, provides for family, avoids idleness.
  - `[Whiteboard: Industrious (Prov 31:13, 27)]`
  - [Brief Analogy (from v. 13): Like a skilled artisan finding joy in her
    craft, she applies herself purposefully to the tasks God gives.]
  - **(RQ)** How does diligence in seemingly mundane tasks connect to our
    spiritual walk (Col 3:23)?
- **Constructive & Wise Speech (v. 26):** "She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
  and in her tongue is the law of kindness."
  - `[Whiteboard: Wise & Kind Speech (Prov 31:26)]`
  - Contrast: Destructive talk (gossip, criticism) vs. building others up (Eph
    4:29).
- [Aside: Our homes are meant to be sanctuaries where these heavenly virtues are
  cultivated daily. They become small embassies reflecting the character
  principles of God's kingdom.]

### Inner Strength & Divine Source (Prov 31:25, Titus 2:3-5) (10 min) [*]

- Focus: Identifying the source of the virtuous woman's strength and character.
- **Godly Confidence & Positive Outlook (Prov 31:25):** "Strength and honour are
  her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come."
  - This isn't worldly self-esteem, but security found in God's purpose and her
    relationship with Him (v. 30).
  - `[Whiteboard: Strength & Honor (Prov 31:25) <- Rooted in Fear of the Lord (v. 30)]`
  - **(RQ)** How does prioritizing a relationship with God ('fear of the Lord')
    lead to genuine inner strength and honor described here?
- **Universal Need for Christ:** Motherhood doesn't exempt from the need for a
  Savior (Rom 3:23). The goal isn't human perfection, but reliance on Christ's
  perfection and grace (Eph 2:8-9).
  - **(RQ)** Why is recognizing our own need for God's grace crucial for
    extending grace within the family?
- **Cooperation with Christ & Mentorship (Titus 2:3-5):** Godly character
  enables teaching and guiding others. Qualities like reverence, self-control,
  kindness are Spirit-empowered.
  - `[Whiteboard: Titus 2:3-5 - Living & Teaching Godliness]`
  - This isn't self-generated strength, but comes through partnership with God
    (Phil 4:13).
  - [Brief Concept (from Titus 2): Spiritual growth equips us not just for our
    own lives, but to be channels of blessing and guidance to others.]

### The Supportive Family Framework (Eph 5, 1 Pet 3, Prov 31:28) (10 min)

- Focus: God designed motherhood to flourish within a mutually supportive family
  structure.
- **The Husband's Role:** Crucial for enabling the mother's success.
  - **Sacrificial Love (Eph 5:25-27):** Love as Christ loved the church â€“
    self-giving, nurturing, aiming for her spiritual well-being.
    - `[Whiteboard: Husband -> Sacrificial Love (Eph 5:25)]`
  - **Respect & Understanding (1 Pet 3:7):** Treat her with honor as a co-heir
    of grace, understanding her needs.
    - `[Whiteboard: Husband -> Respect & Understanding (1 Pet 3:7)]`
  - **Gratitude & Affirmation (Prov 31:28):** Her family openly praises her
    contributions.
    - `[Whiteboard: Husband -> Express Gratitude (Prov 31:28)]`
  - **Prayer:** Consistently praying for her wisdom, strength, and spiritual
    growth.
  - **(RQ)** In practical terms, how does a husband living out Ephesians 5 and 1
    Peter 3 directly support and strengthen his wife?
- **The Children's Role (Eph 6:1-3):**
  - **Honor & Respect (Ex 20:12, Eph 6:2):** Foundational command with promise.
    - `[Whiteboard: Children -> Honor & Respect (Eph 6:2)]`
  - **Thoughtfulness & Gratitude (Implied from Prov 31:28):** Recognizing and
    appreciating mother's efforts.
  - **Helpfulness & Obedience (Eph 6:1):** Contributing positively to the home.
- [Aside: Like finding unexpected resources, even the challenges of daily family
  life can be turned into opportunities for spiritual growth when we apply God's
  principles. Each role, fulfilled in Christ, contributes to a home reflecting
  heavenly order.]
