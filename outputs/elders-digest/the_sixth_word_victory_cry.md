### Introduction (5 min)

- Setting the Scene: Calvary - darkness, suffering, apparent defeat (Matthew
  27:45).
- Human Perspective vs. Divine Reality: What seemed like the end was the
  ultimate victory (1 Corinthians 1:18 - "For the preaching of the cross is to
  them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of
  God.").
- Introducing the Sixth Word: John 19:30 - Not a sigh of resignation, but a
  shout of triumph.
- Focus: Understanding the depth and finality of "It is finished"
  (_Tetelestai_).
- [Write on board: John 19:30 - "It Is Finished!" = Victory Cry]

### Section 1: The Context of the Cry (10 min) - Biblical Foundation

- The Final Moments: Receiving the vinegar (John 19:28-29) - fulfilling prophecy
  (Psalm 69:21).
- Physical and Spiritual Agony: Real suffering, bearing the weight of sin
  (Isaiah 53:4-6 - "Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows...
  he was wounded for our transgressions...").
- Prophetic Fulfillment: This cry culminates a life lived in perfect obedience
  and fulfillment of Scripture (Luke 24:44).
  - Briefly mention specific prophecies about His suffering/death (e.g., Psalm
    22:1, 16-18).
- The Divine Purpose: Leading to this pre-ordained moment (Acts 2:23 - "Him,
  being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God...").
- **(RQ)** Why was it necessary for Christ to endure _all_ this before declaring
  victory? (Ref. Hebrews 2:10 - perfect through sufferings).

### Section 2: The Meaning of "Finished" (15 min) [*]

- _Tetelestai_: More than 'ended' - means 'paid in full', 'accomplished',
  'completed'. Common on ancient receipts.
  - [Write on board: *Tetelestai* = Paid in Full / Accomplished]
- **A. Fulfillment of the Plan of Salvation:**
  - Old Testament Types & Shadows: Sacrificial system pointed to this moment
    (Hebrews 9:11-14). Its purpose was now complete.
  - Old Testament Prophecies: Messiah's life, suffering, death foretold (Isaiah
    53:10-12; Daniel 9:26). All fulfilled.
  - [Whiteboard: OT -> Christ's Sacrifice (Types: Lamb - John 1:29; Prophecy:
    Isa 53)]
- **B. Completion of Christ's Mission:**
  - Doing the Father's Will: John 4:34 ("My meat is to do the will of him that
    sent me, and to finish his work."); John 17:4 ("I have glorified thee on the
    earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do."). His primary
    objective achieved.
  - Glorifying the Father: Demonstrating God's character (love, justice)
    perfectly (John 17:1).
  - Redeeming Humanity: The price was paid (1 Peter 1:18-19 - "redeemed... with
    the precious blood of Christ").
  - [Whiteboard: Christ's Work FINISHED: 1. Father's Will (Jn 17:4) 2. Father
    Glorified (Jn 17:1) 3. Redemption Price Paid (1 Pet 1:18-19)]
- **C. The Immediate Sign: Temple Veil Torn**
  - Matthew 27:51: God's dramatic confirmation ("the veil of the temple was rent
    in twain from the top to the bottom").
  - Significance (Ref. Desire of Ages): End of earthly types/rituals. Direct
    access to God opened.
  - Hebrews 10:19-22: Boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,
    through the veil (His flesh).
  - [Whiteboard: Veil Torn (Mt 27:51) => Direct Access to God (Heb 10:19-22)]
  - [Aside: The tearing of the veil wasn't just symbolic; it was God
    dramatically declaring the old way obsolete. The path into His presence was
    now wide open through His Son, no earthly priest needed.]
- **(RQ)** If the work is truly finished, why do we still struggle with sin?
  (Distinguish finished _atonement_ from ongoing _sanctification_ - Philippians
  1:6).

### Section 3: Our Response to the Victory (10 min) - Practical Application

- **A. Embrace the Open Door:**
  - Revelation 3:8: Christ sets before us an open door no one can shut ("behold,
    I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it").
  - What does this mean practically? **(RQ)** Access to God's presence,
    forgiveness, grace, power (Ephesians 3:12).
  - Hebrews 4:16: Come boldly to the throne of grace ("Let us therefore come
    boldly unto the throne of grace...").
- **B. Rest in His Finished Work:**
  - Assurance of Salvation: Based on _His_ accomplishment, not our performance
    (Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For by grace are ye saved through faith... not of
    works").
  - Freedom from Condemnation: Romans 8:1 ("There is therefore now no
    condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus..."). The debt is paid.
  - [Illustration Concept (from 1 Pet 1:18-19): Like a debt fully paid - the
    creditor has no more claim. Satan has no ultimate claim on those covered by
    the blood.]
  - **(RQ)** How does knowing salvation is _finished_ change how we face daily
    trials or temptations? (Focus shifts from earning to receiving/abiding -
    John 15:4-5).
- **C. Live in Joyful Gratitude:**
  - The response is not just relief, but rejoicing (Philippians 4:4 - "Rejoice
    in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice.").
  - Our lives become a 'thank offering' for the completed work (Hebrews 13:15 -
    "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
    continually...").
  - [Whiteboard: Our Response: 1. Enter the Open Door (Heb 4:16) 2. Rest in
    Assurance (Rom 8:1) 3. Rejoice in Victory (Phil 4:4; Heb 13:15)]
- **D. Actionable Steps:**
  - This week: Consciously thank God daily for the _finished_ work of Christ
    (Hebrews 13:15).
  - Approach prayer with boldness, remembering the veil is torn (Hebrews
    10:19-22).
  - When facing guilt, remind yourself: _Tetelestai_ - Paid in Full (1 Peter
    1:18-19; Romans 8:1).
- [Aside: Sometimes we live as if the veil is still there, approaching God
  timidly. But Christ's cry invites us to boldly enter the throne room of grace
  (Heb 4:16), knowing the way is permanently open.]

### Conclusion (5 min)

- Recap: "It is finished" â€“ the most powerful declaration of victory (John
  19:30).
- Summary: The plan fulfilled (Luke 24:44), the price paid (1 Peter 1:18-19),
  the way opened (Hebrews 10:19-20).
- The work of atonement is complete. Redemption is secured.
- Invitation: Will you accept this finished work? Will you live in the reality
  of this victory, entering boldly through the open door (Hebrews 4:16)?
- Final Thought: Let the triumphant cry of Christ echo in our hearts, bringing
  assurance (Romans 8:1), peace (John 14:27), and joyful confidence in our
  Redeemer.
