### Section 1: Unique Origin & Composition (10 min)

-   **The Bible's Unique Assembly:**
    -   Diverse Authors (~40), Times (~1500 years), Places (3 continents), Languages, Genres.
    -   Yet, a unified message centering on God's plan of salvation through Christ.
    -   [Whiteboard: Simple Timeline: Moses (~1400 BC) -> Malachi (~400 BC) -> NT Authors (~50-100 AD) => One Story]
    -   (RQ) How could such diversity produce such unity without a single guiding Author? [Point to God]
-   **God's Methods of Revelation (Hebrews 1:1-2):**
    -   God spoke directly, through angels, visions, dreams, nature, prophets, and ultimately His Son.
    -   [Whiteboard: Heb 1:1-2 - Diverse Methods, One Source]
    -   Emphasis: God actively communicated His will.
-   **Connection:** This unique composition points to a supernatural origin.

### Section 2: Divine Inspiration & Illumination (12 min) [*]

-   **The Meaning of Inspiration (2 Timothy 3:16):**
    -   "Given by inspiration of God" - Greek *Theopneustos* = "God-breathed."
    -   [Write on board: Inspiration (2 Tim 3:16) = God-Breathed]
    -   Not mechanical dictation, but God superintending human authors, using their personalities and styles, yet ensuring accurate transmission of His message.
-   **The Human Element & Divine Guidance (2 Peter 1:21):**
    -   "Holy men of God spake as they were moved [borne along] by the Holy Ghost."
    -   [Whiteboard: 2 Pet 1:21 - Human Author + Holy Spirit Guidance]
    -   Analogy: Like a ship guided by the wind in its sails.
    -   (RQ) Does acknowledging the human authors diminish the Bible's divinity, according to Peter?
-   **The Need for Illumination (1 Corinthians 2:13-14):**
    -   Inspiration relates to the *writing* of Scripture; Illumination relates to the *understanding*.
    -   The same Holy Spirit who inspired the Word must enlighten our minds to grasp spiritual truth.
    -   [Write Question on board (from 1 Cor 2:14): Why can't the 'natural man' receive spiritual things?]
    -   [Aside: Like needing sunlight to truly see the colors in a painting, we need the Spirit's light to see the spiritual beauty and truth in Scripture.]
    -   Practical: Prayer before study is essential.
