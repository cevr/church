### Introduction (6 min)

-   **The Solemnity of Our Times:** Briefly touch on current events reflecting end-time prophecies. Why is *now* different? **(RQ)**
-   **Defining Urgency:** Not panic, but sober, Spirit-filled intensity driven by love and truth.
    -   [Write on board: URGENCY = Sober Intensity + Divine Mandate (2 Tim 4:2)]
-   **Central Mandate:** Introduce 2 Timothy 4:2 as the core instruction for God's messengers.
-   **Study Goal:** To understand *why* urgency is essential and *what* message demands it, based on Scripture.

### The Watchman's Urgent Mandate (10 min)

-   **Need/Question (from text):** Ezekiel 33:8-9 highlights the life-or-death consequences of failing to warn. The need is for faithful messengers. Question: How seriously do we take God's explicit command to warn others based on His Word? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** God appoints believers as watchmen, responsible for hearing His Word and faithfully warning those in danger (Ezekiel 33:7). This requires constant readiness (2 Timothy 4:2a).
    -   [Whiteboard: Watchman (Ezek 33:7) -> Hear from God -> Warn for God]
    -   `[Aside: Ancient watchmen often used trumpets (shofars) - a piercing sound demanding immediate attention, much like the urgency needed for God's final message. Ref: Num 10:9, Jer 6:17]`
-   **Bridging (from text):** Just as ancient watchmen physically guarded cities from approaching danger, we are called to spiritually guard souls by sharing God's warnings and truths found in Scripture within our modern spheres of influence (family, work, community). The responsibility described in Ezekiel is personal for believers today.
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Pray:** Ask God this week to show you *who* specifically He wants you to be a "watchman" for (Ezek 33:7).
    2.  **Prepare:** Identify one specific warning or truth (e.g., Sabbath, state of the dead, judgment) you feel hesitant to share and study it directly from the Bible this week to gain clarity (2 Tim 4:2 - "teaching").
    3.  **Practice:** Mentally (or aloud) rehearse how you would kindly but clearly "convince, rebuke, or exhort" someone regarding that truth, focusing on "longsuffering" (2 Tim 4:2).
-   **Invitation:** Let's embrace the solemn weight and privilege of being God's watchmen, committed to faithfulness.

### The Vision to Proclaim [*] (12 min)

-   **Need/Question (from text):** Revelation 10:6 declares "delay no longer," and Habakkuk 2:3 assures the vision "will surely come, It will not tarry." The need is for swift, clear communication of God's final message. Question: Are our lives and our communication reflecting the biblical truth that time is short and the message must be plain? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** God's prophetic timeline is certain, entering its final phase (Rev 10:6), demanding the message ("the vision") be made clear and proclaimed urgently so people can understand and respond ("run who reads it" - Hab 2:2).
    -   [Write on board: Vision (Hab 2:2) -> Make it PLAIN -> So others can RUN (Respond)]
-   **Bridging (from text):** Habakkuk was told to write plainly on tablets for runners. Today, we must communicate God's last-day message (centered on the Three Angels' Messages of Rev 14) with unmistakable clarity and conviction, using appropriate means but always ensuring faithfulness to the *biblical* vision. The certainty ("it will not lie" - Hab 2:3) fuels our urgency.
    -   `[Aside: Habakkuk wrote during a time of impending national crisis (Babylonian invasion), adding weight to his message about waiting for God's appointed time even when judgment seems slow or overwhelming. His urgency was rooted in real-world events reflecting spiritual realities.]`
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Clarify:** Review the core points of the Three Angels' Messages (Rev 14:6-12) this week. Can you state each message's essence simply and biblically? (Hab 2:2 - "make it plain").
    2.  **Simplify:** Identify one way you tend to overcomplicate sharing the message and practice making it plainer (e.g., focus on one key point, use less jargon).
    3.  **Share:** Intentionally share one clear resource (tract, article, video link) explaining an aspect of the end-time "vision" with someone this week (Hab 2:2 - "that he may run").
-   **Invitation:** Let's commit to understanding the vision clearly and running with the message without delay.

### Practical Urgency & Spirit's Power (10 min)

-   **Need/Question (from text):** We have the watchman's mandate (Ezek 33) and the urgent vision (Hab 2, Rev 10). But *how* do we fulfill this practically without burning out or relying on self? The need is for divine enablement. Question: Are we attempting this monumental task in our own strength, or are we actively seeking the power promised in Acts 1:8? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** Fulfilling the urgent commission to be witnesses requires supernatural power, which comes only through the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8). This power enables readiness "in season and out of season" (2 Tim 4:2).
    -   [Analogy (from Acts 1:8): Like a car needing fuel - we have the vehicle (the call) and the map (the message), but need the Spirit's power (fuel) to actually go and be effective witnesses.]
-   **Bridging (from text):** The same Holy Spirit who empowered the disciples for explosive gospel growth after Pentecost is promised to us today (Acts 1:8). Our sense of urgency must be coupled with a deep dependence on Him to overcome fear, speak with wisdom ("teaching" - 2 Tim 4:2), live credibly, and persevere ("longsuffering" - 2 Tim 4:2).
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Seek:** Begin each day this week praying specifically for the infilling of the Holy Spirit for power in witnessing (Acts 1:8; Luke 11:13).
    2.  **Confront:** Identify one specific fear (e.g., rejection, inadequacy) that hinders your witnessing and ask the Spirit for boldness (Acts 4:31).
    3.  **Act:** Look for one opportunity *this week* where you can step out in faith to share or serve, consciously relying on the Spirit's guidance and strength ("be ready in season and out of season" - 2 Tim 4:2).
-   **Invitation:** Let's cease striving in our own strength and earnestly seek the promised power of the Holy Spirit to fulfill our urgent calling.

### Conclusion and Appeal (7 min)

-   **Recap:** We are called as watchmen (Ezek 33:7), given an urgent, certain message for a time of no delay (Hab 2:2-3, Rev 10:6), mandated to preach persistently (2 Tim 4:2), and promised divine power to do so (Acts 1:8).
-   **The Defining Question:** Knowing these truths, will we live with Spirit-filled urgency, or will we allow complacency to dull our sense of mission? **(RQ)**
-   **Final Exhortation:** Reiterate the core message of 2 Timothy 4:2 - the time demands readiness, conviction, and compassionate teaching.
-   **Personal Appeal:** Gently invite listeners to recommit to being faithful watchmen, to making the vision plain, and to seeking the Spirit's power daily. Encourage taking one specific action step discussed during the study this week.
-   **Prayer:** Pray for a renewed sense of urgency, for clarity in the message, and for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the congregation for witnessing.
