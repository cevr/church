### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Universal longing for something better, a place without pain. Is it just
  a dream? **(RQ)**
- Bible reveals Heaven is real, tangible, prepared. Our ultimate destination.
- Jesus' promise: The foundation of our study (John 14:2-3).
- Goal: Explore what the Bible _actually_ says about Heaven and how we can be
  sure of going there.
- [Write on board: Heaven - Real? Prepared? How?]

### Main Content 1: Heaven - A Real, Prepared Place (10 min)

- **A Prepared Place:**
  - Jesus' explicit promise: "I go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2-3).
    Not an afterthought.
  - [Whiteboard: John 14:2-3 - "Prepared Place"]
  - It's the "Father's house" - implies family, belonging, security.
- **God's Dwelling & Christ's Presence:**
  - Where God dwells (Rev 21:3 - "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with
    men...").
  - Where Christ is now (Heb 8:1-2 - Minister in the sanctuary; Heb 12:22-24 -
    Heavenly Jerusalem, Jesus the Mediator).
  - Where we will be _with Him_ (John 14:3 - "...that where I am, there you may
    be also").
- **Freedom from Sin's Curse:**
  - The contrast to Earth: No more tears, death, sorrow, crying, pain (Rev
    21:4).
  - [Whiteboard: Earth (Sin/Suffering) vs. Heaven (No Sin/Suffering) - Rev 21:4]
  - Why no suffering? Because the _source_ (sin) is gone (Rev 21:27; Rev 22:3 -
    "no more curse").
  - This isn't just improvement; it's total restoration. **(RQ)** How does
    knowing sin is _completely_ removed change our perspective?

### Main Content 2: Life in the New Heaven [*] (12 min)

- **Activities Without Limitation:**
  - **Worship:** Central activity, face-to-face (Rev 22:3-4; Rev 7:9-12).
    Unhindered praise.
  - **Service:** Meaningful activity, serving God directly (Rev 22:3 - "His
    servants shall serve Him"). Not idleness, but joyful purpose.
  - **Fellowship:** With God, angels, saints (Heb 12:22-23). Perfect harmony.
  - **Learning:** Exploring God's creation and character for eternity (1 Cor
    13:12 - "know fully"). Infinite growth.
  - **Rest:** True rest, not from exhaustion, but peaceful enjoyment (Heb
    4:9-11 - Sabbath rest remains).
  - [Whiteboard: Heavenly Life: Worship | Service | Fellowship | Learning | Rest
    (Rev 22:3-5)]
- **The Ultimate Joy: Seeing Jesus:**
  - The pinnacle: "They shall see His face" (Rev 22:4).
  - [Aside: Seeing His face isn't just a visual thing; it implies full
    communion, understanding His love and sacrifice perfectly, reflecting His
    character without the veil of sin.]
  - This relationship is the core of Heaven's bliss (John 17:3 - Eternal life is
    knowing God/Jesus).
  - **(RQ)** What distracts us now from seeking His face? How will Heaven
    fulfill that deepest longing?

### Main Content 3: The Only Way to Heaven (12 min)

- **Assurance Through Christ Alone:**
  - Not based on feelings, works, or heritage. Solely on Christ.
  - Faith in Jesus: Believing _who_ He is and _what_ He did (John 3:16; 1 John
    5:11-13).
  - His Blood: Cleanses from sin (1 John 1:7, 9; Rev 1:5).
  - His Righteousness: Covers our unrighteousness (Rom 3:21-24; Phil 3:9). We
    are accepted _in Him_.
  - [Whiteboard: Assurance = Faith + Blood + Righteousness (of CHRIST) - 1 John
    5:12]
- **Jesus: The Exclusive Path:**
  - His own words: "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the
    Father except through Me" (John 14:6).
  - [Whiteboard: John 14:6 - THE Way, THE Truth, THE Life]
  - Apostolic confirmation: "Nor is there salvation in any other..." (Acts
    4:12).
  - **(RQ)** Why is it crucial to understand there aren't multiple paths to the
    Father's house? (Reflects God's holiness, sin's seriousness, Christ's unique
    sacrifice).
- **Building on the Solid Rock:**
  - Parable of the builders (Matt 7:24-27). Hearing and _doing_
    (obeying/trusting) Jesus' words.
  - Christ is the Rock (1 Cor 10:4). Our hope must be built _only_ on Him.
  - [Whiteboard: Hope? Sinking Sand (Self/Works/World) vs. Solid Rock (CHRIST -
    Matt 7:24)]
  - [Aside: Like building a house near the shore, worldly hopes seem appealing
    but lack foundation when storms hit. Building on Christ ensures stability
    now and eternal security.]
  - Practical check: Where is my trust _really_ placed day-to-day? **(RQ)**

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Heaven is real (John 14:2-3), perfect (Rev 21:4), centered on Jesus
  (Rev 22:4).
- The Way is clear and exclusive: Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).
- Assurance is available _now_ through faith in Him (1 John 5:13).
- Invitation: Choose the Solid Rock. Don't build on sinking sand (Matt 7:24-27).
  - Examine your foundation. Is it Christ alone?
  - Accept His offer of salvation and the promise of the prepared place.
- Final Encouragement: Live today with the certain hope of Heaven, allowing that
  hope to transform our present character and priorities. Let's prepare to meet
  Him face-to-face.
