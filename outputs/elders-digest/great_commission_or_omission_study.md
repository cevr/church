### Introduction (5 min)

- **The Choice:** Commission vs. Omission. Are we actively fulfilling Christ's
  last command, or passively neglecting it? **(RQ)**
- **Central Command:** Read Matthew 28:19-20. This isn't the Great Suggestion.
- **Study Goal:** To understand the scope, message, power, and _specific
  end-time relevance_ of the Great Commission from Scripture.
- [Whiteboard: Title - Great Commission or Great Omission? Central Verse: Matt
  28:19-20]

### Section 1: The Unmistakable Mandate (10 min)

- **Foundation of Authority:** Matthew 28:18 - Where does the authority for this
  mission come from? ("All power is given unto me...")
  - [Whiteboard: AUTHORITY = Jesus (Matt 28:18)]
- **The Command:** Matthew 28:19a - "Go ye therefore..." - It requires action,
  movement.
- **The Scope:** Matthew 28:19b - "...teach all nations..." - Universal reach.
  No exceptions.
  - [Whiteboard: COMMAND = Go, Teach (Disciple). SCOPE = All Nations.]
  - **(RQ)** How does 'all nations' challenge our comfort zones and personal
    preferences?
- **The Process:** Matthew 28:19c-20a - "...baptizing them... Teaching them to
  observe all things..." - Not just conversion, but ongoing discipleship in
  _all_ of Christ's teachings.
  - [Whiteboard: PROCESS = Baptizing + Teaching Obedience (All things)]
- **The Promise:** Matthew 28:20b - "...lo, I am with you alway..." - The divine
  enablement and presence.
  - [Whiteboard: PROMISE = Christ's Presence Always]

### Section 2: The Message & Method (12 min) [*]

- **The Core Gospel:** Mark 16:15 - "...preach the gospel to every creature."
  What _is_ this essential gospel?
  - Jesus Christ: Son of God, Savior (John 3:16).
  - His Sacrifice: Death for our sins (1 Cor 15:3).
  - His Victory: Resurrection providing life (1 Cor 15:4, 20).
  - [Whiteboard: GOSPEL (Mark 16:15) = Jesus + Cross + Resurrection = Salvation]
- **Method 1: Verbal Proclamation:** "Preach," "Teach" (Matt 28:19-20, Mark
  16:15). Requires clear communication of truth.
- **Method 2: Lifestyle Witness:** Matthew 5:14-16 - "Ye are the light of the
  world... Let your light so shine..."
  - Our lives must validate the message. Character transformation creates
    spiritual thirst.
  - [Whiteboard: WITNESS = Proclamation (Words) + Lifestyle (Light - Matt 5:16)]
  - **(RQ)** Based on Matt 5:16, how can our daily actions either open or close
    doors for sharing the verbal message?
  - [Brief Illustration Concept (from Matt 5:14): Our lives like a city on a
    hill â€“ visible, distinct, either drawing people towards the light or causing
    them to question it.]

### Section 3: The Power & Present Truth Context (12 min)

- **The Essential Power Source:** Acts 1:8 - "But ye shall receive power, after
  that the Holy Ghost is come upon you..."
  - Human effort is insufficient. Divine power is promised and necessary.
  - [Whiteboard: POWER = Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8)]
  - **(RQ)** Why is dependence on the Holy Spirit non-negotiable for fulfilling
    the commission according to Acts 1:8?
- **The Commission's Final Phase:** Revelation 14:6-7 - The Everlasting Gospel
  in End-Time Context.
  - Connects the universal gospel call (v. 6) with specific truths for the last
    days.
  - [Whiteboard: Rev 14:6-7 = Everlasting Gospel + Specific End-Time Message]
  - **Point 1: The Judgment Hour:** "...the hour of his judgment is come..." (v.
    7a). Adds urgency and context to the gospel call. (Connects to Investigative
    Judgment understanding).
  - **Point 2: Call to Worship the Creator:** "...worship him that made heaven,
    and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters." (v. 7b). Directly
    counters evolutionary thought and false worship systems; points to the
    Sabbath.
  - [Aside: Our specific message isn't just 'Jesus saves,' but 'Jesus saves,
    judgment is here, worship the Creator NOW.' It's the Great Commission
    amplified for the final moments of earth's history.]
- **Integrating the Mandates:** The Matt 28 commission finds its final, most
  urgent application in the Rev 14 message. It's not a different gospel, but the
  _same_ everlasting gospel with its pointed, present truth application.
  - [Whiteboard: Matt 28 (Go/Teach) + Acts 1:8 (Power) + Rev 14 (Final Message)
    = Our Full Commission]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** We have a clear Mandate (Matt 28), a powerful Message (Gospel),
  essential Methods (Word & Life - Mark 16:15, Matt 5:16), divine Power (Acts
  1:8), and a specific end-time Context (Rev 14).
- **The Danger of Omission:** Failing to act, failing to share the _full_
  message for this time.
- **Call to Action (Practical Steps derived from texts):**
  1.  **Pray for Power:** Seek the Holy Spirit daily (Acts 1:8).
  2.  **Live the Light:** Let character reflect Christ (Matt 5:16).
  3.  **Know the Message:** Study the core Gospel _and_ the Three Angels'
      Messages (Mark 16:15, Rev 14).
  4.  **Start Local:** Witness in your 'Jerusalem' (Acts 1:8).
  5.  **Speak the Truth:** Be ready to share verbally (Matt 28:19).
  - [Whiteboard: Action: Pray (Acts 1:8), Live (Matt 5:16), Know (Rev 14), Start
    Local (Acts 1:8), Speak (Matt 28:19)]
- **Final Appeal:** Will we be guilty of the Great Omission, or faithful to the
  Great Commission in its _fullest_, final sense? Let's choose faithfulness,
  relying wholly on His power and presence (Matt 28:20).
