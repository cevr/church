### Introduction (6 min)

- Start with the familiar children's song, "This Little Light of Mine."
- Transition: Beyond a simple song, Jesus gave profound instruction.
- Introduce Theme: What does it _truly_ mean to be salt and light in a practical
  way?
- Read Central Verse: Matthew 5:16. This is our goal.
- Overview: We'll explore Jesus' words in Matthew 5, understand our source of
  light (John 8), how to walk in it (Eph 5), our mission (Acts 1), and our
  ultimate purpose (1 Peter 2, Matt 5).
- (RQ) Are we actively shining, or is our light hidden?

### Section 1: Called to Be Distinct - Salt & Light (10 min)

- **Focus Text:** Matthew 5:13-14a
- **You are the Salt of the Earth (Matt 5:13):**
  - Salt's function: Preserves, adds flavor, creates thirst, _distinctive_.
    `[Whiteboard: SALT (Matt 5:13) = Preserving Influence, Distinctive Character]`
  - Losing savor: Becoming like the world, ineffective. (RQ) In what ways might
    we lose our spiritual 'saltiness'?
  - Practical: Requires contact _without_ assimilation.
- **You are the Light of the World (Matt 5:14a):**
  - Light's function: Dispels darkness, reveals truth, guides the way.
    `[Whiteboard: LIGHT (Matt 5:14a) = Revealing Truth, Guiding Path]`
  - Contrast: Light is inherently different from darkness.
  - (RQ) What specific 'darkness' (false ideas, harmful practices) in our
    society does God call us to expose with His light?
- Connection: Both metaphors emphasize _difference_ and _influence_. We cannot
  bless the world by becoming like it.

### Section 2: The Source and Power of Our Light [*] (10 min)

- **Focus Texts:** John 8:12, Ephesians 5:8-11
- **Jesus, The True Light (John 8:12):**
  - He is the source. Our light is _reflected_ light.
    `[Whiteboard: Jesus (Source - John 8:12) ---> Believer (Reflection)]`
  - Following Him = having the light of life. It's relational.
- **Transformed by Light (Eph 5:8):**
  - Past: "Ye _were_ sometimes darkness."
  - Present: "But _now_ are ye light _in the Lord_."
  - Command: "Walk as children of light."
  - (RQ) How does remembering we _were_ darkness motivate us to walk _in_ the
    light now?
- **Living in the Light (Eph 5:9-11):**
  - Fruit of the Spirit/Light: Goodness, righteousness, truth (v. 9).
    `[Whiteboard: Fruit of Light (Eph 5:9) = Goodness, Righteousness, Truth]`
  - Discernment: Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord (v. 10).
  - Action: Have no fellowship with darkness, but rather reprove them (v. 11).
    `[Brief Concept: Light doesn't negotiate with darkness; it exposes it by its very presence.]`

### Section 3: Shining Together and Individually (12 min)

- **Focus Texts:** Matthew 5:14b-15, Acts 1:8
- **Corporate Witness: City on a Hill (Matt 5:14b):**
  - Cannot be hidden. Represents the collective visibility of God's people.
    `[Whiteboard: City on Hill (Matt 5:14b) = Visible Corporate Witness]`
  - The Church's Role:
    - Quote: "The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men. It
      was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the
      world." (EGW, Acts of the Apostles, p. 9).
    - Connect to Mission Mandate: Acts 1:8 - Empowered by the Spirit to be
      witnesses globally. `[Write: Acts 1:8 - Spirit-Empowered Mission]`
    - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
      truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent
      the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]
- **Individual Witness: Candle in the House (Matt 5:15):**
  - Purpose: Gives light "unto all that are in the house." Our personal sphere.
    `[Whiteboard: Candle (Matt 5:15) = Personal Witness (Home, Work, Community)]`
  - (RQ) Who is 'in your house' that needs the light God has given you?
- **Hindrances to Individual Light:**
  - Under a Bushel: Represents work, business, daily cares that consume focus
    and hide faith. `[Whiteboard: Bushel = Worldly Cares Hiding Light]` (RQ) Is
    our pursuit of livelihood overshadowing our call to witness?
  - Under a Bed: Represents comfort, ease, leisure, privacy, inactivity.
    `[Whiteboard: Bed = Comfort/Inactivity Hiding Light]` (RQ) Are we too
    comfortable to shine?
  - [Analogy: A lamp is made to shine. Covering it defeats its purpose. Our
    faith is meant to be seen in action.]

### Section 4: The Purpose and Focus of Our Witness (7 min)

- **Focus Texts:** Matthew 5:16, 1 Peter 2:9
- **Ultimate Goal: Glorify God (Matt 5:16):**
  - Let light shine -> Men see good works -> They glorify _your Father_.
    `[Whiteboard: Our Good Works ---> Point to ---> God's Glory (Matt 5:16)]`
  - The focus is _not_ on us, but on Him. Our lives are evidence of His power.
  - (RQ) When people see our lives, do our actions naturally point them toward
    God?
- **Declare His Praises (1 Peter 2:9):**
  - Chosen generation, royal priesthood... _why?_ -> "that ye should shew forth
    the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous
    light."
  - Witness involves _telling_ what God has done.
    `[Whiteboard: Show Praises (1 Peter 2:9) = Declare God's Work]`
  - Our transformation _is_ the message that draws others from darkness.

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: We are called by Christ to be distinct (salt/light), reflecting His
  light (John 8), walking in truth (Eph 5). We shine corporately (city) and
  individually (candle), avoiding hindrances (bushel/bed). Our purpose is not
  self-promotion but God's glory (Matt 5:16) and drawing others to Him (1 Peter
  2:9).
- Re-read Matthew 5:16. This is the practical outcome of genuine faith.
- Challenge Question: This week, how will you intentionally remove any 'bushel'
  or 'bed' covering your light?
- Gentle Appeal: Choose one specific way to let your light shine in your 'house'
  (personal sphere) or contribute to the 'city's' light (church community),
  ensuring your actions point clearly back to the Father.
- Final thought: Let the world see not just _your_ light, but _Jesus_ shining
  through you.
