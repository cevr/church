### Introduction (6 min)
-   The Reality: Many are spiritually lost, separated from God (Isa 59:2).
-   The Commission: Christ's final command - Go! (Matt 28:19-20).
-   The Question: How seriously do we take this mission? **(RQ)**
-   Focus: Understanding God's perspective and our role based on Scripture.
-   [Write on board: Mission: Reaching the Lost (Matt 28:19)]

### Section 1: God's Heart for the Lost (10 min)
-   **Immense Value:** Every soul is precious to God.
    -   God's declaration: He seeks His sheep (Ezek 34:11-12).
    -   He binds up the broken, strengthens the sick (Ezek 34:16a).
    -   [Whiteboard: Ezekiel 34:11-12 - God *Seeks* His Sheep]
-   **Divine Compassion, Not Condemnation:**
    -   Jesus saw the crowds as sheep without a shepherd (Matt 9:36).
    -   His heart was moved with compassion. **(RQ)** Is ours?
    -   God demonstrated His love while we were still sinners (Rom 5:8).
    -   [Write on board: Matt 9:36 - Compassion > Condemnation]
-   **The Father's Desire:** Not willing that any should perish (2 Pet 3:9).
    -   This reflects God's character – love and mercy.

### Section 2: The Call to Seek (12 min) [*]
-   **Active Pursuit Required:** We must go *after* the lost.
    -   The shepherd *leaves* the ninety-nine and *goes after* the one (Luke 15:4).
    -   [Whiteboard: Luke 15:4 - Leave & Go After]
    -   It's not passive waiting, but deliberate effort. **(RQ)** Are we waiting for the lost to come to us, or are we going to them?
    -   [Analogy (from Luke 15:4): Like a search and rescue team – requires intentionality and action.]
-   **Christ-like Acceptance:** Creating a welcoming environment.
    -   Jesus ate with publicans and sinners (Mark 2:15-17) – demonstrating acceptance, not approval of sin.
    -   Our attitude should draw people *towards* Christ, not push them away.
    -   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture, welcoming those seeking refuge and truth.]
-   **Laborers Needed:** The harvest is plentiful, laborers few (Matt 9:37).
    -   Pray for the Lord to send workers (Matt 9:38).
    -   Recognize *we* are called to be those laborers.
    -   [Write Question (from Matt 9:37): Are we praying for laborers AND being one?]

### Section 3: Persistent, Personal Effort (10 min)
-   **Personal Responsibility:** Reaching the lost involves *us*.
    -   Turning a sinner from error saves a soul from death (James 5:19-20).
    -   This implies personal engagement – speaking truth in love.
    -   [Whiteboard: James 5:20 - Your Effort -> Soul Saved]
-   **Key Methods:**
    -   Sharing Jesus: Testifying to what He has done (Mark 5:19).
    -   Prayer: Interceding specifically for lost individuals (1 Tim 2:1-4).
    -   [Write on board: Methods: 1. Share Jesus (Personal) 2. Pray (Specific)]
-   **Persistence is Crucial:** Don't give up easily.
    -   The woman searches *diligently* until she finds the coin (Luke 15:8).
    -   Evangelism often requires sustained effort and patience. **(RQ)** Do we get discouraged too quickly?
    -   Trust God with the results, but be faithful in the effort (1 Cor 3:6-7).

### Conclusion & Appeal (7 min)
-   **Heaven's Joy:** The ultimate motivation – immense joy in heaven over *one* repentant sinner (Luke 15:7, 10).
    -   [Whiteboard: Luke 15:7 - Heaven Rejoices Over ONE!]
    -   Our efforts participate in this divine celebration.
-   **Recap:**
    -   God values the lost immensely (Ezek 34).
    -   He calls us to seek them with compassion (Matt 9:36, Luke 15:4).
    -   This requires persistent, personal effort (James 5:19-20).
-   **The Invitation:**
    -   Who is the 'one' God is calling you to seek? **(RQ)**
    -   Commit to praying for specific individuals this week.
    -   Ask God for opportunities and courage to share His love.
    -   Let the joy of heaven motivate our mission (Luke 15:7).
