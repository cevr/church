### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce Topic: The tension between Jesus' command "Judge not" and the need
  for discernment.
- Common Misunderstanding: Is _all_ judgment forbidden? **(RQ)**
- Central Question: What kind of judgment does Christ forbid, and what kind does
  He require? `[Whiteboard: Write Title & Central Question]`
- Brief overview of study flow: Examining Matthew 7, then balancing with other
  scriptures.

### Section 1: The Prohibition - Hypocritical Judgment (12 min)

- **Focus Text:** Matthew 7:1-2
- **Point:** Censorious, hypocritical judgment of others is forbidden.
  - Read Matt 7:1. What does "Judge not" mean in this context? **(RQ)**
    `[Whiteboard: Judge Not (Matt 7:1) = Condemnatory/Hypocritical]`
  - Not about suspending critical thinking, but condemning others while ignoring
    own faults.
- **Point:** We will be judged by the same standard we use for others.
  - Read Matt 7:2. The principle of reciprocity.
    `[Whiteboard: Your Standard -> God's Standard for You (Matt 7:2)]`
  - How does knowing this standard affect how we view others' faults? **(RQ)**
  - Connect to Romans 2:1 - Judging others condemns ourselves if we do the same
    things.
- **Point:** Criticizing others often stems from a lack of love and blindness to
  one's own greater faults.
  - This spirit is contrary to Christ's character.
  - [Brief Illustration Concept (from text): Like pointing out a speck of dust
    on someone's shirt while wearing mud-caked clothes.]

### Section 2: The Prerequisite - Self-Examination (8 min)

- **Focus Text:** Matthew 7:3-5
- **Point:** Self-examination and correction _must precede_ attempts to correct
  others.
  - Read Matt 7:3-4. The absurdity of the beam and the mote.
    `[Whiteboard: 1st: My Beam (Matt 7:3-4)]`
  - Why is it easier to see the 'mote' in another's eye than the 'beam' in our
    own? **(RQ)**
- **Point:** Removing the 'beam' from one's own eye is necessary to see clearly
  to help another.
  - Read Matt 7:5. The goal isn't just self-correction, but _then_ being able to
    help the brother/sister effectively.
    `[Whiteboard: 2nd: Remove Beam -> See Clearly -> Help Brother (Matt 7:5)]`
  - This requires humility and honest self-assessment before God.
  - Practical Step: Before addressing a fault in another, pray asking God to
    reveal _your own_ related faults (Psalm 139:23-24).

### Section 3: The Permission - Righteous Discernment [*] (10 min)

- **Point:** Christians _are called_ to exercise righteous judgment and
  discernment.
  - **Key Text:** John 7:24 - "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge
    righteous judgment."
    `[Whiteboard: Righteous Judgment (John 7:24) vs. Appearance]`
  - This is not condemnation, but evaluation based on truth and God's standards.
- **Point:** Discernment is necessary for spiritual safety and church purity.
  - **Text:** Matthew 7:6 (Holy things to dogs/pearls before swine) - Requires
    discerning who is receptive/unreceptive.
  - **Text:** Matthew 7:15-20 (Beware of false prophets) - Requires judging by
    their fruits. `[Whiteboard: Judge by Fruits (Matt 7:16, 20)]` How do we
    identify 'fruits'? **(RQ)**
  - **Text:** 1 Corinthians 5 (Dealing with open sin in the church) - Paul
    commands the church to judge those _inside_ the church regarding blatant
    sin.
- **Point:** Judging motives or assuming God's role as judge of the heart is
  wrong.
  - **Text:** Romans 14:4, 12 - We are accountable to God, not each other, for
    heart motives and matters of conscience not explicitly defined by God's law.
    `[Whiteboard: Don't Judge Motives/Heart (Rom 14:4)]`
  - [Aside: *"It's easy to assume we know *why* someone did something wrong. But
    God alone sees the heart. Our role, guided by His Word, is often to address
    the observable action, not the assumed motive, leaving the final judgment of
    the heart to Him."*]

### Section 4: The Posture - Humility and Restoration (5 min)

- **Point:** Confronting sin in others should be done with humility, love, and a
  spirit of restoration.
  - **Key Text:** Galatians 6:1-2 - "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault,
    ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness;
    considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's
    burdens..."
    `[Whiteboard: Goal = Restoration; Attitude = Meekness (Gal 6:1)]`
  - How does 'considering thyself' change the approach? **(RQ)**
  - **Text:** Matthew 18:15 - The process starts privately, motivated by love
    and desire for reconciliation.
- Contrast: Censorious spirit (Matt 7:1-5) vs. Restorative spirit (Gal 6:1).

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- Summary: Recap the balance.
  - We MUST avoid hypocritical, condemnatory judgment (Matt 7:1-2).
  - We MUST practice rigorous self-examination first (Matt 7:3-5).
  - We MUST exercise righteous discernment based on God's Word and observable
    fruit (John 7:24, Matt 7:15-20).
  - When addressing sin, our goal must be restoration, approached with humility
    and love (Gal 6:1, Matt 18:15).
- The Danger: Falling into either extreme - harsh judgment or indifference to
  sin.
- The Call: Ask God for wisdom (James 1:5) to know _when_ and _how_ to apply
  these principles.
- Final Thought: Let our standard be Christ's standard of love and truth. How
  can we better reflect His character in how we view and interact with others
  this week? **(RQ)**
- Closing Prayer: Ask for humility, wisdom, and a spirit of restoration.
