### Introduction (5 min)

-   Recap: Ecclesiastes 1 - The cycle of life 'under the sun', initial conclusion of vanity.
-   Introduce Solomon's personal quest in Eccl 2: If general observation suggests vanity, what about personal experience with the *best* the world offers?
-   Setting the Stage: Solomon had unparalleled wisdom, wealth, and power. He could test life's pursuits like no other.
-   (RQ) What does our modern world tell us brings happiness and meaning?
-   [Write on board: Solomon's Question: Can *anything* 'under the sun' truly satisfy?]

### Section 1: The Grand Experiment (12 min)

-   **Testing Pleasure and Mirth (Eccl 2:1-3):**
    -   Deliberate pursuit: "I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth..." (v. 1).
    -   Initial verdict on laughter/mirth: Madness, accomplishes little (v. 2).
    -   Experimenting with wine and folly, while guided by wisdom (v. 3). A controlled dive into hedonism.
    -   (RQ) Why does superficial pleasure often feel empty afterward (v. 2)?
-   **Testing Achievement and Acquisition (Eccl 2:4-10):**
    -   Great Works: Houses, vineyards, gardens, pools (v. 4-6).
    -   Vast Possessions: Servants, livestock, silver, gold, singers (v. 7-8).
    -   Unprecedented Success: "whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them" (v. 10a).
    -   [Write on board: Solomon's Pursuits (Eccl 2:1-10): Mirth, Wine, Folly, Building, Gardens, Wealth, Servants, Music]
    -   Temporary Satisfaction: Found *some* joy in the labor itself (v. 10b) - a foreshadowing.
-   **The Peak of Worldly Attainment:** Solomon reached the pinnacle of 'under the sun' success.
    -   [Aside: It's easy to chase grand achievements, thinking *that's* where fulfillment lies. But God often hides true contentment in the daily bread, the simple task done well, the quiet moment of gratitude – things easily overlooked in our striving.]

### Section 2: The Sobering Conclusion (12 min) [*]

-   **The Overall Assessment (Eccl 2:11):**
    -   Looking back on *everything*: "all was vanity and vexation of spirit" (lit. 'grasping for the wind').
    -   No ultimate profit 'under the sun'.
    -   [Write on board: Eccl 2:11 -> RESULT = Vanity + Grasping for Wind]
    -   (RQ) Why 'grasping for wind'? What does that image convey about worldly pursuits?
-   **Wisdom vs. Folly Reconsidered (Eccl 2:12-17):**
    -   Wisdom *is* better than folly (light vs. darkness) (v. 13-14a).
    -   BUT: The same fate awaits both - death (v. 14b-16).
    -   [Write on board: Wise vs. Fool -> Same End (Death)]
    -   Result: Despair and hatred of life 'under the sun' (v. 17). Wisdom alone couldn't solve the problem of mortality.
    -   [Aside: This despair highlights why the Gospel is truly 'good news'. Without Christ's victory over the grave (1 Cor 15:54-57), Solomon's conclusion here is the bleak, logical end. But thankfully, the story doesn't end 'under the sun'.]
-   **The Frustration of Legacy (Eccl 2:18-23):**
    -   Hating one's labor because it must be left behind (v. 18).
    -   Uncertainty: Will the heir be wise or foolish? (v. 19).
    -   The toil yields sorrow and grief even during life (v. 22-23).
    -   [Analogy: Building a magnificent sandcastle just before the tide comes in].
    -   (RQ) How does the temporary nature of earthly success challenge our modern focus on career and wealth accumulation?

### Section 3: The Divine Perspective - A Glimmer of Hope (10 min)

-   **Shifting Focus: From 'Under the Sun' to 'From the Hand of God' (Eccl 2:24-25):**
    -   The ability to enjoy simple things (eating, drinking, labor) is not inherent in the things themselves.
    -   It is a *gift* from God (v. 24b).
    -   [Write on board: Eccl 2:24 -> Enjoyment = GIFT of God]
    -   Personal testimony: Solomon recognizes this truth applies even to him (v. 25).
    -   (RQ) How does seeing enjoyment as a *gift* change our perspective compared to seeing it as something we *achieve* or *deserve*?
-   **God's Sovereign Distribution (Eccl 2:26):**
    -   To the person who is 'good in his sight', God gives wisdom, knowledge, and *joy* (v. 26a).
    -   [Write on board: God Gives -> Wisdom, Knowledge, Joy -> To the 'Good in His Sight']
    -   Contrast: The sinner gathers and heaps up, only for it to be given to the one good in God's sight (v. 26b; cf. Prov 13:22, 28:8).
    -   This goodness is not self-righteousness, but alignment with God's will, stemming from a relationship with Him.
    -   [Concept: Worldly pursuit = grasping, trying to *take* satisfaction. Godly living = receiving, accepting God's *gifts* (including joy) with gratitude.]

### Conclusion (6 min)

-   **Summary of Findings:** Solomon's exhaustive experiment confirms: Pursuing satisfaction solely through worldly means (pleasure, possessions, achievements) leads to vanity and despair.
-   **The Key Insight:** True, lasting enjoyment is not found *in* the activities or possessions themselves, but is a separate gift bestowed by God.
-   **Connecting to the Gospel:** This points beyond the 'under the sun' perspective. The ultimate source of joy and meaning is found in relationship with the Giver, God Himself, through Jesus Christ (John 15:11).
-   **Practical Application:** 
    -   Stop 'grasping for the wind'. Seek God first (Matt 6:33).
    -   Cultivate gratitude for simple, daily gifts (food, work, relationships) recognizing them as 'from the hand of God' (Eccl 2:24).
    -   Align life with God's will ('good in his sight') to receive His gifts of wisdom, knowledge, and true joy (Eccl 2:26).
    -   [Whiteboard: Action -> Seek God > Seek Things. Receive Gifts > Grasp for Wind.]
-   **Invitation:** Choose today to seek satisfaction not in the fleeting things of the world, but in the Giver of all good gifts. Accept His greatest gift – eternal life and joy through faith in Jesus Christ.
