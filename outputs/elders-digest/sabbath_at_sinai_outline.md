### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: Why discuss the Sabbath? Isn't it just an Old Testament, Jewish law? Let's trace its roots through Scripture.
-   Central Question: What did God intend when He commanded us to *remember* the Sabbath at Sinai?
-   Central Verse Focus: Exodus 20:8 - The word "Remember" is key. It points backward. It's not introducing something new, but calling to mind something established.
-   Study Goal: To understand the Sabbath's origin, its reaffirmation at Sinai, its deep meaning as a sign of Creation and Redemption, and its practical blessing for us today, directly from the Bible.
-   Roadmap: Creation -> Pre-Sinai Evidence -> The Sinai Command -> Meaning (Creator/Redeemer) -> Practical Blessing & Application.

### Before Sinai: The Foundation (8 min)

-   **The Origin: Creation Week**
    -   Genesis 2:1-3: God rested, blessed, and sanctified the seventh day.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Gen 2:1-3 -> RESTED | BLESSED | SANCTIFIED]`
    -   (RQ) Who was present at Creation? Adam and Eve - representing all humanity. (Ref Mark 2:27 - Sabbath made for *man*, not just Jews).
    -   Established *before* sin entered – part of God's perfect plan for relationship and rest.
-   **Evidence Before the Law Given:**
    -   Exodus 16:4-5, 22-30: The Manna Test in the wilderness.
    -   God explicitly tested Israel's obedience regarding the Sabbath *before* reaching Sinai.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Ex 16 -> Manna Test (No Manna Day 7) -> Sabbath Already Known]`
    -   (RQ) Why test them on this *before* formally giving the Decalogue? (Shows its foundational importance and pre-existing understanding).
    -   `[Aside: The Hebrew word for Sabbath, "Shabbat," literally means to cease, to end, to rest. It's built into the rhythm God established from the beginning.]`

### Sinai: Reaffirmation & Meaning (12 min) [*]

-   **The Commandment Given:**
    -   Exodus 20:8-11: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
    -   Verse 8: "Remember" - Connects directly back to Creation (Gen 2:1-3) and their recent experience (Ex 16).
    -   Verses 9-10: Six days of labor, seventh day is Sabbath *of the Lord thy God*. It belongs to Him. Includes everyone: family, servants, strangers, even animals. Universal rest.
    -   Verse 11: The Reason Why - "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth... and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Ex 20:8-11 -> REMEMBER -> Holy Rest (Universal) -> WHY? Creation Memorial]`
    -   **Illustration:** Remembering the Sabbath is like remembering a wedding anniversary. It's not just recalling a date, but recalling the relationship, the commitment, the love established on that original day. Forgetting the anniversary weakens the connection; remembering it strengthens it. The Sabbath reminds us of our connection to our Creator.
-   **The Dual Meaning: Creator & Redeemer**
    -   Deuteronomy 5:12-15: The commandment repeated, but with an added reason.
    -   Verse 15: "And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand... therefore the Lord thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Deut 5:15 -> REMEMBER -> Redemption from Egypt -> Sabbath = Sign of Freedom/Deliverance]`
    -   (RQ) How does remembering Creation AND Redemption deepen the Sabbath's meaning? (Points to God as both our Originator and our Liberator through Christ).
    -   The Sabbath is a sign of who God is (Creator) and what He does (Redeems).

### The Sign & The Blessing (10 min)

-   **The Sabbath as a Sign:**
    -   Exodus 31:13, 17: "Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you... It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever."
    -   Ezekiel 20:12, 20: Given "to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them... Hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Sabbath = SIGN -> God Sanctifies Us | God is Our God (Relationship)]`
    -   It's a visible identifier of God's people and a reminder of His sanctifying power.
-   **The Sabbath as a Delight & Blessing:**
    -   Isaiah 58:13-14: Conditional promise for those who honor the Sabbath.
    -   Verse 13: Call the Sabbath a "delight," "holy of the Lord, honourable." Turn away from doing your own pleasure, speaking your own words.
    -   Verse 14: The Result - "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord; and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."
    -   (RQ) How can refraining from our "own ways" lead to *delight*? (Redirects focus from self to God, opening us to His joy and blessings).
    -   `[Aside: Notice the contrast Isaiah draws: our ways vs. God's ways, our pleasure vs. delighting in the Lord. The Sabbath offers a weekly opportunity to intentionally choose God's focus.]`

### Practical Application: Living the Sabbath Delight (7 min)

-   **Need/Question (from text):** How do we move beyond merely *not working* to truly experiencing the Sabbath as the "delight" God intended (Isaiah 58:13)? How do we make it a sign of His work in our lives (Ex 31:13)?
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** Honoring the Sabbath involves ceasing from our regular work and worldly pursuits ("not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words") and actively delighting in the Lord and His holy day (Isaiah 58:13). It's a conscious turning *towards* God.
-   **Bridging (from text):** Just as Israel needed to remember God as Creator (Ex 20) and Redeemer (Deut 5), we need this weekly reminder. In our busy, secular world, the Sabbath calls us back to our foundation in God and His power to save and sanctify us. It's a practical way to "know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you" (Ex 31:13).
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Prepare Ahead:** Plan during the week (like gathering double manna - Ex 16:22) so Sabbath hours are free from regular chores and business for focused rest and worship.
    2.  **Shift Focus:** Intentionally turn conversations and thoughts towards spiritual themes, away from ordinary work/worldly concerns ("not speaking thine own words" - Isa 58:13). Engage in prayer, Bible study, fellowship, nature, acts of mercy.
    3.  **Seek Delight:** Ask God to help you find joy *in Him* on His day. Look for ways to make the day special and holy, a true "delight" (Isa 58:13).
-   **Illustration:** Think of preparing for a special guest. You clean the house, prepare food, and set aside time specifically for them. Preparing for the Sabbath is similar – preparing our homes and hearts to welcome the presence of the Lord in a special way.

### Conclusion & Invitation (3 min)

-   Recap: The Sabbath isn't a late invention or merely a Jewish custom. It began at Creation (Gen 2), was known before Sinai (Ex 16), commanded at Sinai as a memorial of Creation (Ex 20) and Redemption (Deut 5), serves as a sign of our relationship with God (Ex 31, Ez 20), and is intended to be a delight and blessing (Isa 58).
-   Central Verse Reiteration: Exodus 20:8 - "Remember..." Let this study help us remember its deep roots and rich meaning.
-   **Invitation:** Will you choose to "remember" the Sabbath this week? Will you ask God to help you prepare for it, cease from the mundane, and truly find *delight* in Him, experiencing it as the sign of His creative and redemptive power in your life? Let's seek the blessing He promises.
