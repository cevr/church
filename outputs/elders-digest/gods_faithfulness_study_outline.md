### Main Content 2: Faithfulness Expressed - Saving Grace, Security, & Supply (12 min) [*]
-   **God's Faithfulness in Salvation:**
    -   The Need: We were spiritually dead, objects of wrath (Eph 2:1-3).
        -   [Whiteboard: Need: Dead in Sin (Eph 2:1-3)]
    -   The Principle: God, rich in mercy, made us alive *by grace* (Eph 2:4-5).
        -   [Whiteboard: Solution: GRACE (Eph 2:4-5, 8) = God's Initiative]
        -   Connect to calling on Jesus: Salvation received through faith and confession (Rom 10:9, 13) - God faithfully responds to the call He invites.
    -   (RQ) Seeing our state in Eph 2, how does God's grace demonstrate His faithfulness to His loving character?
-   **God's Faithfulness in Security:**
    -   The Principle: Believers are "kept by the power of God through faith" (1 Pet 1:5).
        -   [Whiteboard: Kept by God's Power (1 Pet 1:5)]
        -   (RQ) What does it mean to be 'kept'? Does it mean no difficulties? (Discuss: preservation *through* trials for salvation).
-   **God's Faithfulness in Provision & Power:**

        -   [Whiteboard: Provision (Phil 4:19)]

### Main Content 3: Our Response - Hope, Waiting, and Trust (10 min)
-   **Focus: Lamentations 3:24-26**
    -   **God as Our Portion (v. 24a):**
        -   Principle: Finding ultimate satisfaction and sufficiency in God Himself.
        -   [Whiteboard: God = My Portion (Lam 3:24)]
        -   (RQ) What things in modern life compete to be our 'portion' instead of God? How does this verse redirect our source of satisfaction?
    -   **Hope in Him (v. 24b):**
        -   Because He is faithful and our portion, hope is the logical response.
    -   **Waiting Patiently (v. 25-26):**
        -   Principle: It is *good* to hope and wait quietly for God's salvation/deliverance.
        -   [Whiteboard: Response: Hope -> Wait Patiently (Lam 3:25-26)]
        -   [Analogy (from Lam 3): Waiting on God like a farmer waits for harvest â€“ requires patience, trust in unseen processes, based on the known reliability of seasons (God's faithfulness).] 
    -   **Trusting Through Trials:**
        -   Connecting faithfulness to trials: Trusting God's unchanging character *during* difficulties is key.
        -   This trust develops endurance and character (cf. James 1:2-4, Rom 5:3-5).
        -   [Aside: Sometimes waiting feels like inaction, but biblical waiting is active trust. It's like holding steady in a storm because you know the anchor (God's faithfulness) holds firm, even when everything else is shaking.]
        -   (RQ) How can remembering God's past faithfulness (Lam 3:22-23) help us wait patiently (Lam 3:25-26) in present trials?
