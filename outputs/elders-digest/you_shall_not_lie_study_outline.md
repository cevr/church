### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: The commonness of 'little white lies' or 'social fibs'. **(RQ)** Are they harmless, or does God see them differently?
-   Introduce the Ninth Commandment: Exodus 20:16 - "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."
    -   Scope: Beyond perjury - includes all forms of deceit.
-   Purpose: To explore God's perspective on lying vs. truth, the Holy Spirit's role in developing honesty, and why absolute truthfulness is critical for Christian character, especially for God's people in the last days.
-   Read Central Verse: Proverbs 12:22. `[Whiteboard: Prov 12:22 - Lying Lips = ABOMINATION vs. Truthful Dealing = DELIGHT]`

### Main Content Section 1: God's Hatred for Lies & Love for Truth (10 min)

-   **The Need:** Understanding the seriousness of lying in God's eyes.
-   **Biblical Principle (Prov 6:16-19):** Lying is listed among things God hates.
    -   Read Prov 6:16-19. `[Whiteboard: God HATES (Prov 6:16-19): ...a lying tongue... a false witness who speaks lies...]`
    -   Explain "abomination": Deeply offensive, detestable.
    -   **(RQ)** Why such strong language? Because lying attacks God's very nature.
-   **Biblical Principle (Num 23:19; Heb 6:18):** God's nature is truth.
    -   Read Num 23:19; Heb 6:18. `[Whiteboard: God = TRUTH (Cannot Lie - Num 23:19, Heb 6:18)]`
    -   Contrast: God is the standard of truth; lying is inherently anti-God.
    -   Connect: Reflecting God means reflecting His truthfulness.
-   **Biblical Principle (Ps 31:5-6):** Truth builds trust; lies destroy it.
    -   Read Ps 31:5-6. David trusts the "God of truth" and hates liars.
    -   `[Brief Illustration Concept (from Ps 31): Trust like a bridge - built plank by plank with truth. Lies are like removing planks, making the bridge unsafe and unusable.]`
    -   **(RQ)** How have lies damaged trust in your own experience or observation?

### Main Content Section 2: Truthfulness as Evidence of Transformation [*] (12 min)

-   **The Need:** Recognizing that honesty isn't just good behavior, but evidence of spiritual rebirth.
-   **Biblical Principle (Col 3:9-10):** Truthfulness marks the new life in Christ.
    -   Read Col 3:9-10. `[Whiteboard: Old Self (Lies) -> PUT OFF | New Self (Truth) -> PUT ON (Col 3:9-10)]`
    -   Explain: Lying belongs to the old, sinful nature we discard at conversion. Truthfulness is part of the 'new self', being renewed in God's image.
    -   **(RQ)** If we claim to be 'new creations' (2 Cor 5:17), how should Colossians 3:9 impact our speech?
-   **Biblical Principle (John 14:17; 16:13):** The Holy Spirit empowers truthful living.
    -   Read John 14:17; 16:13. `[Whiteboard: Holy Spirit = Spirit of TRUTH (John 14:17) -> Guides into ALL Truth (John 16:13)]`
    -   Explain: The Spirit doesn't just reveal doctrinal truth, but guides us into practical, lived-out truthfulness. He provides the power to overcome ingrained habits of dishonesty.
    -   `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies... our lives, empowered by the Spirit of Truth, should represent the kingdom of truth, standing in stark contrast to the customs of a deceitful world.]`
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Integrity and truthfulness are attributes of God we are called to reflect (EGW, *My Life Today*, p. 331). This isn't optional; it's core to Christian identity.

### Main Content Section 3: Truth in Action - Protection, Liberation, and Last Day Significance (12 min)

-   **The Need:** Understanding the practical benefits and urgent necessity of truthfulness today.
-   **Biblical Principle (Eph 6:14):** Truth provides spiritual protection.
    -   Read Eph 6:14. `[Whiteboard: Armor of God: Belt of TRUTH (Eph 6:14) - Holds everything together]`
    -   Explain: Living in truth secures us against Satan's deceptions. Dishonesty creates vulnerabilities.
    -   **(RQ)** How can seemingly small dishonesties weaken our spiritual defenses?
-   **Biblical Principle (John 8:32):** Truth brings freedom.
    -   Read John 8:32. `[Whiteboard: Truth -> Freedom (John 8:32) vs. Lies -> Bondage]`
    -   Explain: Jesus' truth liberates from sin's power, including the enslaving nature of lies (covering up, fear of exposure).
-   **Bridging to Last Days:** The final conflict is centered on truth vs. deception.
    -   Contrast: God's call for absolute truthfulness vs. the 'strong delusion' and 'lying wonders' of the last days (2 Thess 2:9-12).
    -   Connect: The Mark of the Beast involves accepting a deception; the Seal of God involves loyalty to God's truth, reflected in character.
    -   **Biblical Principle (Rev 14:1, 5):** God's final generation is marked by absolute truthfulness.
        -   Read Rev 14:1, 5. `[Whiteboard: Sealed Remnant (Rev 14:1-5): NO GUILE / DECEIT]`
        -   Explain 'guile': Deceit, craftiness, dishonesty. This absence of guile is essential for reflecting Christ's character perfectly and standing through the Investigative Judgment and final crisis.
        -   **(RQ)** Seeing Revelation 14:5, how does this raise the standard for honesty beyond just avoiding major lies?
        -   `[Aside: Instead of conforming to worldly standards of 'acceptable' dishonesty, we can use every interaction as an opportunity to reflect God's truth. It's like finding a worldly coinâ€”we can choose to use it for God's kingdom of integrity, demonstrating His way in a deceptive world.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
