### Introduction (5 min)

*   **Hook:** We all hold citizenship somewhere. But for the Christian, there's a higher allegiance. **(RQ)** How does our ultimate identity shape our present reality?
*   Introduce concept: Living on earth while belonging to heaven.
*   **Central Theme:** Our heavenly citizenship (Phil 3:20) dictates how we must live on earth – worthily of the Gospel, united, steadfast, and striving together (Phil 1:27).
*   [Write on board: Phil 3:20 -> Heavenly Citizenship | Phil 1:27 -> Earthly Conduct]

### Section 1: Dual Citizenship & Worthy Conduct (10 min)

*   **Our True Home:** Define heavenly citizenship (Philippians 3:20).
    *   Our *politeuma* (commonwealth, state) is in heaven.
    *   From where we await the Saviour, Jesus Christ.
*   **The Mandate:** Connect heavenly identity to earthly living (Philippians 1:27a).
    *   "Only let your conversation [manner of life] be as it becometh [axios - worthily] the gospel..."
    *   [Write on board: Conduct (axios) = Worthy of the Gospel's Value]
*   **What 'Worthy' Looks Like:**
    *   Reflecting the character and priorities of Christ and His kingdom. **(RQ)** Does my daily life reflect the immense value of the Gospel?
    *   Not about earning salvation, but living in response to it.
    *   Supporting Texts: Walk worthy of the vocation (Eph 4:1), Walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing (Col 1:10).
*   **Need/Question:** How can we live here when we belong there?
*   **Biblical Principle:** Our heavenly citizenship demands a lifestyle that honors the Gospel message (Phil 1:27a).

### Section 2: United Front for the Faith [*] (12 min)

*   **The Call to Unity:** Focus on Philippians 1:27b.
    *   "...stand fast in one spirit, with one mind..."
    *   [Whiteboard: Unity = One Spirit + One Mind]
    *   Why unity? Essential for effective witness and strength against opposition (John 17:21).
*   **Striving Together:**
    *   "...striving together [sunathlountes] for the faith of the gospel."
    *   Meaning: Contending alongside one another, like athletes on a team or soldiers side-by-side.
    *   [Analogy: Rowing team - must pull together in sync to move forward].
    *   Protecting the purity of the faith and proclaiming it.
*   **Hindrances vs. The Ideal:**
    *   Common hindrances: Immaturity, individualism, personal preferences, fatigue, doctrinal disagreements on minor points.
    *   Biblical Ideal: Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace (Eph 4:2-3). Lowliness, meekness, longsuffering, forbearing.
    *   **(RQ)** What personal attitudes or actions might hinder my 'striving together' with fellow believers?
*   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.
*   **Bridging/Action:** Unity isn't uniformity, but shared purpose focused on the Gospel faith. Requires humility and active cooperation.

### Section 3: Steadfastness & Heavenly Representation (12 min)

*   **Facing Opposition:** Address Philippians 1:28.
    *   "And in nothing terrified by your adversaries..."
    *   Lack of fear is a sign (endeixis - token, proof) to opponents of their destruction, but to believers of salvation from God.
    *   [Whiteboard: Steadfastness (No Fear) -> Sign of God's Power]
*   **The Privilege of Suffering:** Focus on Philippians 1:29.
    *   "For unto you it is given [echaristhe - graciously granted] in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake..."
    *   Suffering for faith is a gift, part of the discipleship package (cf. Matt 5:10-12, Acts 5:41, 1 Peter 4:12-14).
    *   **(RQ)** How does viewing suffering as a 'gift' change our perspective when facing trials for our faith?
*   **Representing Heaven Attractively:** Connect back to 'worthy conduct'.
    *   Our unified stand and steadfastness under pressure make the Gospel attractive.
    *   Living as citizens of heaven involves reflecting Christ's character in all areas:
        *   **Dress:** Modesty, simplicity, neatness (1 Tim 2:9).
        *   **Action:** Honesty, integrity, service (1 Peter 2:12).
        *   **Thought:** Purity, focused on things above (Phil 4:8, Col 3:2).
        *   **Speech:** Gracious, truthful, edifying (Eph 4:29).
    *   [Whiteboard: Heavenly Citizen -> Reflects Christ (Dress, Action, Thought, Speech)]
*   **Character Perfection:** Bearing Heaven's Marks.
    *   This lifestyle demonstrates the transforming power of the Gospel.
    *   EGW Emphasis: "Those who are citizens of the kingdom of heaven will bear the image of the heavenly... They will reveal the character of Christ." (Paraphrased concept, e.g., *Testimonies*, Vol. 4, p. 18; *Christ's Object Lessons*, p. 315-316 on representing Christ's attractive character).
*   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed.
*   **Action Steps:** Identify one area (dress, action, thought, speech) where heavenly citizenship needs clearer expression. Pray for grace to stand firm and united.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

*   **Recap:** We are citizens of heaven (Phil 3:20), called to live worthily on earth (Phil 1:27). This means unity, striving together for the faith, standing firm without fear, and even embracing suffering as a gift (Phil 1:27-29).
*   **The Call to Action:** Christian citizenship is not passive; it's active participation – standing, striving, representing.
