### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the Book of Ecclesiastes: The Preacher's (Solomon's) quest for meaning.
- Theme: Life "under the sun" - observations on reality, wisdom, folly, and God's hand.
- Introduce the tension: God's order vs. human experience of confusion and injustice.
- Purpose of study: To find wisdom and practical faith amidst life's perplexities, guided by the Preacher's inspired insights.

### God's Sovereign Timing & Human Limits (Eccl 3:1-15) (12 min)
- **God's Appointed Times (Eccl 3:1-8)**
    - Everything has a divine schedule. [Whiteboard: Eccl 3:1 + List pairs: Birth/Death, Plant/Pluck, Weep/Laugh, etc.]
    - Affirms God's sovereignty over all life events.
    - **(RQ)** How does recognizing God's timing affect our anxiety about the future?
- **The Beauty and the Mystery (Eccl 3:11)**
    - God makes all beautiful *in His time*, not necessarily ours.
    - He placed eternity in our hearts, yet limits our full understanding. [Whiteboard: Eccl 3:11 - "Beautiful in His time" vs. "Cannot find out the work"]
    - **(RQ)** Why might God limit our understanding of His grand plan?
- **God's Eternal Work & Purpose (Eccl 3:14)**
    - God's actions are permanent and purposeful.
    - Intended effect: Reverence/Fear of God. [Whiteboard: Eccl 3:14 - God's Work = Forever -> Fear God]
- **Finding Joy in God's Gifts (Eccl 3:12-13)**
    - The best response: Rejoice and do good.
    - Enjoying life's simple blessings (eating, drinking, labor) is a gift from God.
    - Connects fearing God (v. 14) with enjoying His gifts (vv. 12-13).

### Injustice, Toil, and the Need for Connection (Eccl 3:16-4:16) [*] (12 min)
- **The Problem of Injustice (Eccl 3:16, 4:1)**
    - Observation: Wickedness and oppression exist even in places of judgment.
    - The Preacher sees the tears of the oppressed with no comforter.
    - **(RQ)** How does acknowledging this reality square with God's sovereignty (Eccl 3:1)?
- **God's Future Judgment (Eccl 3:17)**
    - The resolution lies in God's timing for judgment.
    - He *will* judge both righteous and wicked. [Whiteboard: Eccl 3:17 - God judges Righteous & Wicked - *There is a time*]
    - This provides hope amidst present injustice.
- **The Vanity of Isolated Toil (Eccl 4:4-8)**
    - Toil driven by envy is vanity (v. 4).
    - Laziness is self-destructive (v. 5).
    - Isolated, greedy work brings no satisfaction (vv. 7-8).
    - [Analogy (from vv. 4-8): Like chasing the wind – envious or greedy labor yields no lasting fulfillment.]
- **The Power of Fellowship (Eccl 4:9-12)**
    - Two are better than one: Mutual help, warmth, defense.
    - Highlights the practical value of community and support. [Whiteboard: Eccl 4:9-12 Benefits = Help + Warmth + Defense]
    - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... they should be places where this mutual support (Eccl 4:9-12) is lived out, spiritual embassies reflecting heaven's community.]
- **Fleeting Popularity (Eccl 4:13-16) [*]**
    - Wisdom is better than foolish power.
    - Popularity is temporary; earthly fame is vanity.

### Finding Meaning Beyond "Under the Sun" (10 min)
- **Rejoicing in Our Work (Eccl 3:22)**
    - Practical conclusion: Find satisfaction in present duties assigned by God.
    - This is our earthly "portion." [Whiteboard: Eccl 3:22 - Rejoice in own works = Portion]
    - Connects back to Eccl 3:12-13 - enjoying God's gifts.
- **The Limits of Earthly Wisdom**
    - Ecclesiastes reveals the limitations of life *without* a full view of God's plan.
    - **(RQ)** If much under the sun is vanity, where must true, lasting meaning be found?
- **God's Ultimate Purpose in Christ (Eph 1:9-10)**
    - The mystery hinted at in Eccl 3:11 finds fullness in Christ.
    - God's plan: To unite all things in Him. [Whiteboard: Eph 1:9-10 - God's Plan = Unite all in Christ]
    - This gives eternal context to our temporary lives and God's timing.
- **Grace to Navigate Life's Puzzles (Heb 4:15-16)**
    - Jesus understands our struggles (Heb 4:15).
    - We can approach God confidently for grace and mercy in time of need (Heb 4:16) – especially when facing the perplexities Ecclesiastes describes.
- **Obedience as Friendship with Jesus (John 15:14)**
    - True fellowship with God involves more than just enjoying gifts; it involves alignment with His will.
    - Connects fearing God (Eccl 3:14) and doing His commands (John 15:14) as the path to true relationship.
