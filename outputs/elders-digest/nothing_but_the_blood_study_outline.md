### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with the universal problem: Sin and its consequence (death - Rom 6:23).
- Introduce the core question: How can a just God forgive sin? **(RQ)**
- State the Bible's unequivocal answer: Through the shedding of blood.
- Central Verse: Hebrews 9:22.
  `[Write on board: Heb 9:22 - No Remission without Blood]`
- Brief overview: Today we explore _why_ blood, _whose_ blood, and _what_ that
  blood accomplishes for us.

### Section 1: The Necessity of Shed Blood (10 min)

- **The Divine Principle:** Life for Life.
  - Leviticus 17:11 - "For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have
    given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it
    is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul."
  - `[Write on board: Lev 17:11 - Life is in the Blood -> Atonement]`
  - Explain: Blood represents life forfeited by sin. Atonement requires the
    shedding of blood (life given).
- **The Old Testament Types:** Pointing to Reality.
  - Briefly describe the sacrificial system (lambs, goats).
  - Emphasize: These sacrifices _didn't_ perfect the worshipper (Heb 10:1-4) but
    were object lessons.
  - `[Draw simple diagram: OT Sacrifice (Type) -> Pointing to -> Christ (Antitype)]`
  - Why did God institute such a seemingly harsh system? **(RQ)** To impress
    upon humanity the terrible cost of sin and the necessity of a substitute.
  - `[Aside: The sanctuary service wasn't arbitrary; it was a divine curriculum teaching the plan of salvation. Each element, especially the blood, revealed facets of Christ's future work.]`

### Section 2: The Substitute Provided (10 min)

- **The Problem:** Animal blood couldn't truly atone (Heb 10:4). Humanity needed
  a perfect substitute.
- **The Provision:** God provided His Son.
  - Isaiah 53:5-6 - The prophecy of the Suffering Servant.
    `[Write on board: Isa 53:6 - Lord laid on HIM our iniquity]`
  - Explain Substitution: 'I deserved to die. Jesus took my place.'
  - Romans 5:8-9 - Christ died _for us_, while we were sinners. Justified by His
    blood.
  - `[Whiteboard: SINNER (Condemned) <- Christ's Blood (Justifies) -> SAINT (Accepted)]`
  - 1 Peter 1:18-19 - Redemption not with corruptible things, but the _precious_
    blood of Christ. `[Emphasize 'precious']`
  - Christ as the Lamb of God (John 1:29) and our Passover (1 Cor 5:7).
  - How does understanding Christ as _my personal_ substitute change how I view
    my sin and His sacrifice? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: The Sufficiency of His Blood [*] (10 min)

- **Entering the True Sanctuary:**
  - Hebrews 9:11-12 - Christ, our High Priest, entered the _heavenly_ sanctuary,
    not with animal blood, but _His own_ blood.
  - `[Write on board: Heb 9:12 - BY HIS OWN BLOOD -> ETERNAL REDEMPTION]`
- **Once for All:**
  - Contrast with OT priests offering repeatedly (Heb 10:11).
  - Hebrews 9:26, 10:10, 10:12-14 - Christ offered _one sacrifice for sins
    forever_. It is finished, complete, eternally sufficient.
  - `[Analogy: Paying a debt in full vs. making installment payments. Christ's sacrifice paid the debt of sin completely.]`
  - What does 'eternal redemption' mean for our assurance of salvation? **(RQ)**
- **Perfect Atonement:**
  - His sacrifice provides _complete_ freedom from condemnation for those who
    accept it (Rom 8:1).
  - It perfectly met the demands of God's law.

### Section 4: The Application Through Faith (5 min)

- **Accessing the Benefits:**
  - Romans 3:25 - God set forth Christ as a propitiation _through faith in His
    blood_.
  - `[Write on board: Faith in His Blood = Access to Benefits]`
  - It's not enough to know about the blood; we must personally trust in its
    power for _us_.
- **Cleansing the Conscience:**
  - Hebrews 9:14 - "How much more shall the blood of Christ... purge your
    conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
  - What are 'dead works'? **(RQ)** Actions done without faith, or trying to
    earn salvation.
  - The blood cleanses not just the record of sin, but the inner person, freeing
    us for joyful service.
  - `[Aside: Many try to clean up their lives *before* coming to Christ, but it's His blood that cleanses us *so that* we can live differently. It's the cause, not the result, of our transformation.]`
- **Present Ministry:**
  - Christ now ministers His blood in the heavenly sanctuary (Heb 7:25; Heb
    9:24).
  - He pleads His sacrifice on our behalf when we sin (1 John 2:1-2).

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- Recap: Sin demands death (life/blood). Animal blood pointed forward. Christ,
  the perfect substitute, shed His precious blood, offering Himself once for
  all.
- His blood secured eternal redemption, provides complete atonement, and
  cleanses our conscience.
- Reiterate Hebrews 9:22 - Without _His_ shed blood, there is _no_ remission.
- The power is not in a ritual, but in the reality of Christ's sacrifice applied
  through faith.
- **Invitation:** Have you personally accepted the cleansing and redemption
  offered through faith in His blood? **(RQ)**
- Call to trust fully in the finished work of Christ, resting in the assurance
  His blood provides.
- Prayer of commitment/thanksgiving.
