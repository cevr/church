### Introduction (5 min)

- Define Perseverance: Not just waiting, but active endurance, steadfastness
  under trial.
- The Christian life is a marathon, not a sprint. **(RQ)** Why is endurance so
  crucial?
- Introduce Central Verse: Hebrews 12:1 - The race set before us requires
  _patience_ (hupomone - endurance).
- [Write on board: PERSEVERANCE (Hupomone) = Steadfast Endurance]
- Briefly state the study's aim: To see from Scripture _why_ we must persevere
  and _how_ we can.

### Section 1: The Mandate to Persevere (10 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Is just starting the Christian life enough? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (1 Tim 4:15-16):** Paul urges Timothy to _continue_ in
  the doctrine.
  - "Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them... Take heed unto
    thyself, and unto the doctrine; _continue_ in them..."
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Tim 4:16 -> Continue = Salvation (Self & Hearers)]
  - Implication: Perseverance directly linked to eternal outcomes.
- **Biblical Principle (Heb 10:36-37):** Patience needed to receive the promise.
  - "For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye
    might receive the promise."
  - Connects endurance with inheriting God's promises, tied to Christ's soon
    return ("For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come...").
  - [Write Question on board (from Heb 10:36): What 'promise' requires our
    patience?]
- **Bridging to Practice:** This isn't optional; it's fundamental to realizing
  our hope. **(RQ)** How does this challenge a 'casual' approach to faith?

### Section 2: The Source and Example of Perseverance (12 min) [*]

- **The Need/Question:** Where do we find the strength and model for such
  endurance? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (Heb 12:2-3):** Jesus is both the Author/Finisher and the
  Example.
  - "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy
    that was set before him endured the cross..."
  - [Whiteboard: Heb 12:2 -> LOOK TO JESUS]
  - His focus: The joy set before Him (our salvation, restoration).
  - His endurance: Despised shame, endured contradiction of sinners.
  - Application: "...consider him... lest ye be wearied and faint in your
    minds." (Heb 12:3)
  - [Aside: Fixing our eyes on Jesus isn't just a devotional thought; it's a
    strategic necessity. Like a runner focusing on the finish line, it keeps our
    spiritual feet moving forward when weariness sets in.]
- **Biblical Principle (Implied 1 Cor 10:13):** God provides strength and a way
  through trials.
  - "...God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
    able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape..."
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 10:13 -> God Provides Strength + Way of Escape
    (Endurance)]
  - God doesn't always remove the trial, but provides strength _within_ it.
- **Bridging to Practice:** Our ability to persevere isn't self-generated; it
  comes from Christ and His faithfulness. **(RQ)** How does focusing on Christ
  change our perspective on trials?

### Section 3: Perseverance, Perfection, and Promise (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** What is the _purpose_ of trials requiring perseverance?
  **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (James 1:3-4):** Trials develop perseverance, leading to
  maturity.
  - "...the trying of your faith worketh patience [hupomone - endurance]. But
    let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire,
    wanting nothing."
  - [Whiteboard: Trial (James 1:3) -> Perseverance -> Character
    (Perfect/Complete - James 1:4)]
  - Connect to EGW: Perseverance leads to "the perfection of His character" (SM,
    Bk 3, p. 427) - reflecting Jesus fully.
  - Link to Sealing: This character maturity is the goal, the fitness for
    heaven.
- **Addressing Discouragement (Especially Leaders):**
  - Acknowledge the reality of weariness and opposition (invisible powers - Eph
    6:12).
  - Elders/leaders face unique pressures. **(RQ)** Why might spiritual leaders
    be specific targets?
  - Reiterate Heb 12:3: Consider Jesus _lest you grow weary_. His struggle
    validates ours.
- **Contrast: Futile Earthly Endeavors vs. Certain Hope:**
  - [Brief Concept: Masada - Romans persevered for an earthly kingdom, finding
    only death. A symbol of intense effort for temporary/futile goals.]
  - Contrast with Christian Hope (Heb 10:37): Our perseverance is towards an
    _eternal_, _certain_ kingdom promised by God Himself.
  - [Aside: We often invest immense energy in things that ultimately won't last.
    Think of building a sandcastle as the tide comes in. God calls us to invest
    our perseverance in the eternal, like building on the Rock, Christ Jesus.]
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from texts):**
  1.  **Daily Look to Jesus (Heb 12:2):** Consciously start the day focusing on
      His sacrifice and victory.
  2.  **Embrace Trials as Refining (James 1:3-4):** Ask God _what_ He wants to
      develop in you through the difficulty.
  3.  **Actively Continue (1 Tim 4:16):** Don't neglect spiritual disciplines
      (study, prayer, fellowship) that fuel endurance.
  - [Whiteboard: Action Steps: 1. Look to Jesus (Heb 12:2) 2. Embrace Refining
    (Jas 1:4) 3. Continue Disciplines (1 Tim 4:16)]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: Perseverance is commanded (1 Tim 4:16), necessary for the promise (Heb
  10:36), developed through trials (James 1:4), and modeled/empowered by Christ
  (Heb 12:2-3).
- The Goal: Not just enduring, but becoming 'perfect and entire', reflecting
  Christ's character.
- The Certainty: Unlike earthly struggles, our hope is sure. "He that shall come
  will come, and will not tarry" (Heb 10:37).
- Final Encouragement: Don't grow weary (Heb 12:3). The race _can_ be finished
  through His strength.
- **Invitation:** Will you commit today, by God's grace, to run _with
  perseverance_ the race set before you, looking unto Jesus? Let's lean on His
  strength to endure faithfully to the end.
