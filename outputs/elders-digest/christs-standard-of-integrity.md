### Introduction (6 min)

-   Hook: Briefly mention common societal examples of broken promises or lack of integrity (politics, business, personal relationships). Contrast with the desire for trustworthiness.
-   Introduce Topic: Christ calls us to a standard higher than the world's, even higher than mere outward religious conformity.
-   Central Verse: Read Matthew 5:37. This is our anchor point.
-   Overview: Today we'll explore:
    -   Why outward actions aren't enough (Matt 5:20).
    -   Jesus' teaching on oaths and absolute truthfulness (Matt 5:33-37).
    -   How the Holy Spirit enables this integrity (Ezek 36:27).
    -   Applying this standard in daily life (Practical Areas).

### Section 1: Beyond External Righteousness (10 min)

-   **The Higher Standard:** Christ requires righteousness exceeding the scribes and Pharisees (Matt 5:20).
    -   Their focus: Meticulous external observance, often neglecting the heart.
    -   [Whiteboard: Scribes/Pharisees = Outward Focus | Christ = Inward Reality (Matt 5:20)]
    -   (RQ) Why is it easier to focus on external actions than inner motives?
-   **God Sees the Heart:** God desires truth in the inward parts (Psalm 51:6).
    -   He looks beyond the facade (1 Samuel 16:7).
    -   True integrity starts internally.
-   **The Foundation of Integrity:** Who can dwell with God? He that walks uprightly, works righteousness, and speaks truth *in his heart* (Psalm 15:1-2).
    -   [Whiteboard: Psalm 15:1-2 -> Walk Uprightly | Work Righteously | Speak Truth (Heart)]
    -   (RQ) According to Psalm 15, what connects our actions, our words, and our inner state?

### Section 2: The Principle of Absolute Truthfulness (Matt 5:33-37) [*] (12 min)

-   **Context of Oaths:** Jesus addresses the common practice of using elaborate oaths, often as loopholes to avoid simple truthfulness (Matt 5:33-36).
    -   People swore by heaven, earth, Jerusalem, their head – trying to make *some* promises binding while leaving others intentionally weak.
-   **Jesus' Command: "Swear Not at All"** (Matt 5:34).
    -   This establishes a *principle*: A person of integrity doesn't *need* oaths to guarantee their word.
    -   [Whiteboard: Matt 5:34-37 -> Principle: Absolute Truthfulness > Need for Oaths]
-   **"Let Your 'Yes' Be 'Yes,' Your 'No,' 'No'"** (Matt 5:37; James 5:12).
    -   The core command: Simple, consistent, reliable truthfulness.
    -   A Christian's word should be their bond, reflecting God's own faithfulness.
    -   [Whiteboard: Yes = Yes | No = No (Christian's Bond)]
    -   (RQ) How does living by 'Yes is Yes, No is No' simplify our lives and interactions?
-   **Clarification:** This isn't primarily about forbidding judicial oaths (cf. Heb 6:16 where oaths for confirmation are mentioned), but about the *personal character* that makes such reinforcements unnecessary in daily life.
-   **Truthfulness Towards God & Man:** Required because:
    -   God knows the heart (Heb 4:13) – We cannot deceive Him.
    -   Lying violates the 9th Commandment (Ex 20:16) and harms our neighbor (Eph 4:25 - "Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.").

### Section 3: Integrity in Action & Character Transformation (11 min)

-   **Integrity is Holistic:** Christ's standard applies to *all* areas of life.
    -   **Business:** Just weights and measures (Prov 11:1; Lev 19:35-36). No deception.
    -   **Marriage Vows:** Faithfulness and commitment (Mal 2:14-16). Honoring sacred promises.
    -   **Baptismal Vows/Promises to God:** Fulfill what you vow (Eccl 5:4-5). Taking commitments seriously.
    -   [Whiteboard: Apply Matt 5:37 To: Business | Marriage | Vows]
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our daily interactions, promises kept or broken, are declarations about the kingdom we represent. Do they reflect the truthfulness of Heaven or the compromises of the world?
-   **The Source of Transformation: The Holy Spirit:** This high standard isn't met by human effort alone.
    -   God promises a new heart and His Spirit within us to *cause* us to walk in His ways (Ezek 36:26-27).
    -   [Whiteboard: Human Effort Insufficient -> Holy Spirit Power (Ezek 36:27) -> True Integrity]
    -   Faithfulness (pistis - includes trustworthiness, fidelity) is a fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22-23).
-   **God's Character Development Program:** He is committed to completing the work He started in us (Phil 1:6).
    -   We are called to add virtue, knowledge, self-control... to our faith (2 Peter 1:5-8) – a process of growth *enabled by Him*.
    -   [Brief Illustration Concept (from Phil 1:6): God as the Master Potter, patiently shaping us into vessels of honor, removing impurities (like dishonesty) and strengthening integrity.]
    -   (RQ) Seeing God's commitment in Phil 1:6, how should this encourage us when we fail?

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Recap:** Christ calls us beyond outward conformity to deep, inner integrity. His command regarding oaths points to the ideal: absolute truthfulness where our 'Yes' is always 'Yes'.
-   **The Standard and the Source:** This standard seems impossibly high, but it is achievable through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit.
-   **Personal Reflection (RQ):** In what areas of my life (thoughts, words, actions, promises) do I need to align more fully with Christ's standard of integrity?
-   **Invitation:**
    -   Commit today to seeking the Holy Spirit's power for genuine transformation (Ezek 36:26-27).
    -   Embrace God's character development process (Phil 1:6; 2 Peter 1:5-8).
    -   Purpose, by His grace, to let your communication be 'Yea, yea; Nay, nay' (Matt 5:37).
-   **Final Encouragement:** Living with integrity, empowered by God, brings peace with God and man, and ultimately allows us to dwell in His presence (Psalm 15:1-2).
