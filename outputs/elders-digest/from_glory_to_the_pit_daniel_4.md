### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
- Summary: Nebuchadnezzar learned through harsh experience: God is sovereign, pride leads to ruin, humility and repentance lead to restoration and true understanding.
- Victory Through a Repentant Heart: True victory isn't earthly power, but recognizing all blessings and authority originate from God.
- Universal Invitation: God's desire is for all, from kings to commoners, to recognize Him.
    - "Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else." (Isa 45:22)
    - `[Write on board: Look to God & Be Saved (Isa 45:22)]`
    - Nebuchadnezzar's story is a case study for this universal call.
- Finding True Security: In God alone is safety, strength, meaning, and purpose – not in our own 'kingdoms'.
    - `[Aside: Our modern 'Babylons' – career, status, possessions – can become idols just like Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom. True security isn't in what we build, but in the One who gives the ability to build, and whose kingdom lasts forever.]`
- Appeal: Will we learn from Nebuchadnezzar's testimony? Will we humble ourselves before God *before* adversity strikes? Choose today to acknowledge His sovereignty in every area of life.
- Action Step: This week, identify one area where you tend towards self-reliance (like Nebuchadnezzar in Dan 4:30). Consciously pray for humility and dependence on Him in that area, acknowledging His sovereignty (using words similar to Dan 4:34-35).
