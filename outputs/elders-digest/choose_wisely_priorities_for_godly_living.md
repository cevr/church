**Central Bible Verse:** Joshua 24:15 - "And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."

### Introduction (5 min)
-   Life is a series of choices, big and small.
-   Every choice shapes our character and destiny.
-   The most fundamental choice: Who will we serve?
    -   Read Joshua 24:15.
    -   [Write on board: CHOICE -> DESTINY]
    -   This isn't a one-time decision, but a daily reaffirmation through our priorities.
-   Today's study: Examining biblical principles for making choices that align with God's purpose.

### Section 1: Prioritize the Spiritual over the Carnal (10 min)
-   **The Need/Question:** We live in a material world constantly vying for our attention and energy. How do we keep focus? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle (Matt 6:33):** Jesus gives a clear command for priority.
    -   Read Matthew 6:33.
    -   [Write on board: Matt 6:33 -> Seek FIRST: 1. Kingdom of God 2. His Righteousness]
    -   Seeking the Kingdom = Prioritizing God's rule, His ways, His mission in our lives.
    -   Seeking Righteousness = Prioritizing Christ's character, conformity to His will.
    -   The Promise: "All these things shall be added" - God takes care of temporal needs when spiritual priorities are right.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** How does seeking God *first* look practically?
    -   Morning devotion before worldly demands?
    -   [Brief Analogy: Seeking God first is like laying the foundation of a house before building the walls. If the foundation (relationship with God) is secure and prioritized, the rest of the structure (daily life, needs) has stability. Trying to build without the foundation leads to collapse. Matt 6:33 gives us the blueprint for the right foundation.]
    -   Evaluating opportunities based on spiritual impact, not just material gain?
    -   (RQ) What practical steps can ensure God's kingdom is truly *first* in our daily schedule and decisions?
-   **Actionable Steps (from Matt 6:33):**
    1.  Begin each day consciously seeking God's presence and guidance (prayer, Bible study).
    2.  Filter decisions through: "Does this advance God's kingdom in/through me?"
    3.  Trust God's promise to provide for needs when His priorities are honored.
-   **Invitation:** Commit to making God's kingdom the primary filter for your choices this week.

### Section 2: Prioritize the Eternal over the Temporal (12 min) [*]
-   **The Need/Question:** Society emphasizes immediate gratification and worldly success. How do we maintain an eternal perspective? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle (Matt 16:26):** Jesus poses a stark question about ultimate value.
    -   Read Matthew 16:26.
    -   [Write on board: Matt 16:26 -> SOUL vs. WORLD]
    -   The soul's value is infinite; the world's gain is temporary.
    -   Choices often present a trade-off: temporary advantage vs. eternal well-being.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** This principle applies to choices about career, relationships, entertainment, use of time and resources.
    -   [Brief Analogy: Jesus' question in Matt 16:26 is like asking if a merchant would trade a priceless, eternal diamond (the soul) for a handful of dust that blows away in the wind (temporary worldly gain). Our daily choices often present this kind of trade.]
    -   (RQ) Are we investing more in temporary comforts or eternal realities?
    -   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Our personal lives should reflect this same embassy principle.]
-   **Actionable Steps (from Matt 16:26):**
    1.  Regularly contemplate eternity and the value Christ placed on your soul.
    2.  Evaluate major decisions: "What is the *eternal* consequence or benefit?"
    3.  Invest time and resources in things with lasting, heavenly value (relationships, ministry, character development).
-   **Invitation:** Ask God to help you see every choice through the lens of eternity.

### Section 3: Prioritize God's Will over Man's Will (12 min)
-   **The Need/Question:** We face pressure to conform, compromise, or choose convenience over conviction. How do we stand firm? **(RQ)**
-   **Biblical Principle 1 (Acts 9:6):** The surrendered heart's fundamental question.
    -   Read Acts 9:6 (Saul's conversion).
    -   [Write on board: Acts 9:6 -> "Lord, what wilt THOU have me to do?"]
    -   This marks the shift from self-will to God's will.
    -   It requires humility and a willingness to obey, regardless of personal preference or convenience.
-   **Biblical Principle 2 (Rom 12:2):** A call to counter-cultural living.
    -   Read Romans 12:2.
    -   [Write on board: Rom 12:2 -> Transformed (by God's Word/Spirit) > Conformed (to World)]
    -   The world has patterns (peer pressure, trends, popular opinion); God calls us to be transformed by His truth.
-   **Biblical Principle 3 (Dan 1:8):** Commitment demonstrated.
    -   Read Daniel 1:8.
    -   [Write on board: Dan 1:8 -> PURPOSE in heart (Commitment)]
    -   Daniel *pre-decided* based on God's known will (dietary laws reflecting broader principles of purity/separation).
    -   This wasn't about convenience, but commitment to God's standard.
-   **Bridging to Practice:** Standing firm today.
    -   Seeking God's will (Acts 9:6) requires knowing His Word.
    -   Resisting conformity (Rom 12:2) means choosing God's standards even when unpopular (e.g., modesty, Sabbath observance, wholesome entertainment, clean living).
    -   Purposing in the heart (Dan 1:8) means making commitments *before* the temptation or pressure arises.
    -   (RQ) Where do we feel the most pressure to conform rather than be transformed?
    -   (RQ) How does prioritizing convenience undermine commitment to God's revealed will?
-   **Actionable Steps (from Acts 9:6, Rom 12:2, Dan 1:8):**
    1.  Make Acts 9:6 your daily prayer: "Lord, what is YOUR will for me today?"
    2.  Identify one area where you feel pressured to conform; seek God's strength (Rom 12:2) to live according to His Word instead.
    3.  Like Daniel, purpose in your heart *now* to uphold specific biblical principles when tested.
-   **Invitation:** Choose today to seek and follow God's will above all else.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   **Summary:** Making right choices hinges on right priorities:
    1.  The Spiritual over the Carnal (Matt 6:33)
    2.  The Eternal over the Temporal (Matt 16:26)
    3.  God's Will over Man's Will (Acts 9:6, Rom 12:2, Dan 1:8)
-   **Central Call (Joshua 24:15):** The choice remains before us daily.
    -   [Refer back to Whiteboard: CHOICE -> DESTINY]
    -   Serving the Lord isn't passive; it's an active choice reflected in our priorities.
-   **Simplicity of the Gospel:** True wisdom is choosing God and His ways, revealed simply and clearly in His Word.
-   **Final Appeal:**
    -   Reaffirm your choice to serve the Lord today.
    -   Commit to aligning your daily choices with these biblical priorities.
    -   Trust His grace to empower you as you seek to live for Him.
    -   Prayer of commitment.
