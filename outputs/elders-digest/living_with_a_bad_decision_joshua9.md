### Introduction (5 min)

*   **Hook:** Start with a relatable scenario of making a quick decision based on appearances that turned out wrong.
*   **Context:** Briefly set the scene – Israel entering Canaan, commanded to make no league with inhabitants (Deut 7:1-2). Joshua is the experienced leader.
*   **Introduce Joshua 9:** A cautionary tale about a significant leadership failure.
*   **Central Theme:** The vital importance of seeking God's counsel *before* acting and the lasting impact of decisions.
*   **Read Central Verse:** Proverbs 3:5-6. How does this apply to Joshua's situation? **(RQ)**
*   `[Whiteboard: Title & Proverbs 3:5-6]`

### Section 1: The Deception & The Failure (Joshua 9:3-15) (12 min)

*   **The Gibeonite Strategy (vv. 3-13):**
    *   They heard of Israel's victories (v. 3).
    *   Their elaborate deception: old sacks, torn wineskins, old garments, dry/moldy bread (vv. 4-6, 12-13).
    *   Their claim: Came from a far country (vv. 6, 9).
    *   **Point:** Basing decisions solely on superficial evidence is dangerous.
    *   `[Whiteboard: Superficial Evidence (vv. 4-6) vs. Divine Command (Deut 7:2)]`
    *   How convincing was their story? **(RQ)** Why might Israel have been susceptible?
*   **The Critical Failure (v. 14):**
    *   "And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the Lord." (Josh 9:14)
    *   **Point:** Failure to consult the Lord leads to deception and error.
    *   `[Write on board: JOSHUA 9:14 - THE CORE FAILURE]`
    *   Why didn't they ask God? **(RQ)** Overconfidence? Distraction? Seemed obvious?
*   **The Hasty Covenant (v. 15):**
    *   Joshua made peace and a league with them.
    *   The princes of the congregation swore an oath.
    *   Decision made based on flawed human assessment, ignoring divine instruction.
    *   `[Draw arrow: Deception -> No Counsel (v.14) -> Bad Decision (v.15)]`

### Section 2: Discovery & The Dilemma (Joshua 9:16-21) [*] (10 min)

*   **Truth Revealed (vv. 16-18a):**
    *   Three days later, the truth comes out – they were neighbors!
    *   **Point:** Deception, though perhaps temporarily successful, will eventually be discovered (cf. Prov 12:19).
    *   The congregation murmured against the princes (v. 18a).
*   **The Binding Oath (vv. 18b-19):**
    *   The princes' response: "We have sworn unto them by the Lord God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them." (v. 19)
    *   **Point:** Promises and covenants must be kept, even if made under deceptive circumstances or if keeping them is difficult.
    *   `[Whiteboard: OATH (v.19) -> INTEGRITY vs. Convenience]`
    *   Why was keeping the oath so important, even though they were tricked? **(RQ)** (Reflects God's character, Num 30:2).
*   **Managing the Consequences (vv. 20-21):**
    *   Decision: Let them live, but make them servants (hewers of wood, drawers of water).
    *   Trying to mitigate the damage while honoring the oath.

### Section 3: Living with Consequences & Lessons Learned (Joshua 9:22-27 & Principles) (12 min)

*   **Confrontation & Reality (vv. 22-27):**
    *   Joshua confronts the Gibeonites (vv. 22-23).
    *   Their explanation: Fear for their lives (v. 24).
    *   The consequence solidified: Perpetual servitude (vv. 23, 27).
    *   **Point:** One must live with the consequences of bad decisions, even after repentance/acknowledgment. Forgiveness doesn't always erase earthly results.
    *   `[Brief Illustration Concept: Like signing a contract without reading the fine print – you're still bound.]`
*   **Principle 1: Honoring Commitments (v. 19):**
    *   Reiterate the importance of integrity demonstrated by the leaders.
    *   Honoring commitments reflects godly character, even when costly.
    *   `[Aside: Our modern agreements, verbal or written, are tests of character. Like ancient Israel, our 'yes' should mean yes, reflecting God's faithfulness even when circumstances change or we realize we made a poor bargain.]`
*   **Principle 2: The Necessity of Divine Counsel (v. 14):**
    *   Circle back to the root cause: Leaning on own understanding (Prov 3:5).
    *   Contrast with seeking God's wisdom (James 1:5).
    *   `[Whiteboard: Prevention -> James 1:5 - ASK GOD!]`
    *   How can we practically 'ask counsel of the Lord' today? **(RQ)** (Prayer, Bible study, godly counsel).
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from text):**
    1.  Pause before major decisions: Resist pressure for immediate answers (Contrast w/ Josh 9:14-15).
    2.  Actively seek God's will through prayer and Scripture study (Apply James 1:5).
    3.  Value integrity: Keep your word, even when difficult (Reflect Josh 9:19).
    *   `[Whiteboard: Action Steps: 1. Pause 2. Pray/Study (Jas 1:5) 3. Keep Word (Josh 9:19)]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

*   **Summary:** Recap the story's flow – Deception -> Failure to Consult -> Bad Decision -> Consequences -> Integrity in Keeping Oath.
*   **Reiterate Core Lesson:** The danger of self-reliance vs. the safety of seeking God's guidance in *all* things (Prov 3:6).
*   **Modern Relevance:** We face 'Gibeonites' daily – situations/people appearing one way but being another. How do we respond? **(RQ)**
*   **Appeal:** Commit to making Proverbs 3:5-6 and James 1:5 practical realities. Intentionally seek God's counsel *before* making commitments or decisions, big or small.
*   **Final Thought:** While we may live with consequences of past errors, God's grace is sufficient, and seeking Him *now* prevents future regrets.
*   **Closing Prayer:** Ask for wisdom, discernment, and the strength to honor commitments and seek God first.
