### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a question about where people turn for reliable guidance
  in confusing times. **(RQ)** Where do you look for answers you can truly
  depend on?
- **The World's Counsel vs. God's:** Briefly contrast fleeting human wisdom (1
  Cor 1:20-21) with eternal divine truth (Isa 40:8).
- **Introducing the Anchor:** Our confidence isn't blind; it rests on the
  revealed Word of God, our divine blueprint.
- **Central Text:** Introduce 2 Timothy 3:16-17 as our roadmap for this study –
  Paul's charge to Timothy about the power and purpose of Scripture.
- **Goal:** To understand _why_ we can trust God's Word (its origin and nature)
  and _how_ it's designed to transform and equip us (its function and goal).
- `[Whiteboard: Title - We Can Trust His Word]`
- `[Whiteboard: Central Verse - 2 Tim 3:16-17]`

### Section 1: The Unshakeable Foundation: God's Inspired Word (10 min)

- **Need/Question (from text):** In a world of conflicting voices and shifting
  values, what source is truly reliable and authoritative? (cf. 2 Tim 3:1-5
  describing perilous times).
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** Scripture's reliability stems from its
  divine origin – it is God's own inspired Word (2 Tim 3:16a).
  - **Divine Origin:** Focus on "All scripture is given by inspiration of God"
    (2 Tim 3:16a).
    - "Inspiration" (Theopneustos) = God-breathed.
      `[Whiteboard: Theopneustos = God-Breathed]`
    - Not merely human opinions, but God's own revelation through human
      instruments (2 Peter 1:21).
    - **(RQ)** How does knowing the Bible's origin change how we approach it?
      Does it feel different than reading any other book?
  - **Truthfulness Tied to God's Character:**
    - Because God cannot lie (Titus 1:2; Num 23:19), His Word is inherently
      trustworthy.
    - Jesus affirmed: "Thy word is truth" (John 17:17b).
      `[Whiteboard: Trustworthy God (Titus 1:2) -> Trustworthy Word (John 17:17)]`
    - Its fulfilled prophecies (Isa 46:9-10), historical accuracy, and internal
      consistency testify to this divine source.
  - **Enduring Power:**
    - It's not a dead letter, but "living and active" (Hebrews 4:12a).
    - It effectively accomplishes God's purpose (Isaiah 55:11).
    - Contrast with human philosophies that fade (1 Cor 1:19-20).
- **Bridging (from text):** Just as God's breath gave life to Adam (Gen 2:7),
  His breath gives life and authority to Scripture (2 Tim 3:16). This means the
  Bible isn't just an ancient document; it's God speaking reliably to us _today_
  with the same truth and power.

### Section 2: The Purposeful Profitability of Scripture (2 Tim 3:16) (12 min) [*]

- **Need/Question (from text):** If Scripture is God's Word, what is it _for_?
  How does it actually help us in our daily lives? (cf. Ps 119:9 - How can a
  young man keep his way pure?)
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** Scripture is divinely designed to be
  profitable for every aspect of our spiritual growth and correction (2 Tim
  3:16b).
- **Transition:** _Because_ it's God's inspired Word, it is uniquely
  _profitable_ in specific ways.
- **Breaking Down 2 Tim 3:16b:**
  `[Whiteboard: 4 Functions of Scripture (2 Tim 3:16)]`
  - **Doctrine (Didaskalia):** Teaching what is right. Foundational truths about
    God, salvation, humanity (e.g., Eph 4:4-6; Titus 2:1).
    `[Write: Doctrine = What is Right]`
    - **(RQ)** Are we building our lives on the solid doctrines of Scripture, or
      on shifting opinions? (cf. Eph 4:14)
  - **Reproof (Elegchos):** Exposing what is not right. Convicting of sin and
    error (e.g., John 16:8; Titus 1:13). `[Write: Reproof = What is Not Right]`
    - Requires humility to receive (Prov 15:31-32). Hebrews 4:12 - discerning
      thoughts/intents.
  - **Correction (Epanorthosis):** Showing how to get right. Restoring to a
    right state or path (e.g., Gal 6:1; James 5:19-20).
    `[Write: Correction = How to Get Right]`
    - Practical guidance for repentance and change found throughout Scripture.
  - **Instruction in Righteousness (Paideia):** Training in how to stay right.
    Child-training, discipline, ongoing discipleship in God's ways (e.g., Eph
    6:4; Heb 12:5-11). `[Write: Instruction = How to Stay Right]`
    - Building godly character habits through consistent application (Phil 4:9).
- **Holistic Application:** These functions work together for spiritual health,
  like a complete toolkit for the soul.
- `[Analogy (from Ps 119:105): Bible as a GPS - shows the destination (Doctrine), warns of wrong turns/hazards (Reproof), reroutes us when lost (Correction), and teaches safe driving habits for the journey (Instruction).]`
- **Bridging (from text):** These aren't just theological categories. Think
  about your week: Where did you need clear teaching (Doctrine)? Where did you
  feel convicted (Reproof)? Where did you need guidance to change course
  (Correction)? Where do you need ongoing training (Instruction)? Scripture is
  God's provision for all these real-life needs (Ps 119:11).

### Section 3: Equipped for Transformation and Mission (2 Tim 3:17, Matt 28) (12 min)

- **Need/Question (from text):** What is the ultimate _goal_ of Scripture's work
  in us? Is it just personal benefit, or something more? (cf. Matt 5:16 - Let
  your light shine...)
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** The purpose of Scripture's profitability
  is to make the believer complete and fully equipped for every good work God
  intends, including His mission (2 Tim 3:17; Matt 28:19-20).
- **The Goal of Scripture's Profitability:** "That the man of God may be perfect
  (artios), throughly furnished (exartizo) unto all good works" (2 Tim 3:17).
  - **Perfect (Artios):** Complete, fitted, adequate for the task. Not sinless
    perfection _yet_, but fully equipped for God's purpose (cf. Eph 4:12 -
    equipping the saints). `[Whiteboard: Artios = Complete/Fitted]`
  - **Throughly Furnished (Exartizo):** Fully equipped, supplied with everything
    necessary (like a soldier ready for battle).
    `[Whiteboard: Exartizo = Fully Equipped]`
  - **(RQ)** Do we see Bible study primarily as information gathering, or as God
    equipping us for service and transformation?
- **Transformation, Not Just Information:**
  - The Word is meant to change us from the inside out, shaping our character
    (Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18). This is the _result_ of applying its doctrine,
    reproof, correction, and instruction.
  - [Aside: "Studying the Bible isn't just about knowing facts; it's about
    meeting the Author. It's like reading letters from someone you love – you
    learn their heart, their character, their plans for you."]
  - EGW illustrates this transformative power derived from Scripture (as
    described in 2 Tim 3:16-17): _"There is nothing more calculated to
    strengthen the intellect... The mind thus brought in contact with the
    thoughts of the Infinite cannot but expand and strengthen... [It gives]
    nobility to the character, and stability of purpose..."_ (Summarized from
    Steps to Christ, p. 90).
    `[Whiteboard: SC 90 -> Scripture (2 Tim 3:16-17) leads to: Stronger Intellect, Noble Character, Stable Purpose]`
- **Equipped for "All Good Works" - Including Mission:**
  - What are these "good works"? They encompass all aspects of Christian living
    and service (Eph 2:10).
  - Crucially, this includes the mission Christ gave the church: "Go ye
    therefore, and teach all nations..." (Matthew 28:19-20a).
  - Being "throughly furnished" by Scripture (2 Tim 3:17) means we are equipped
    with the message (the Gospel), the methods (teaching, baptizing), and the
    character needed to fulfill the Great Commission.
  - Our personal transformation fuels our witness (Acts 1:8).
- **Bridging (from text):** Being "fitted" and "fully equipped" (2 Tim 3:17)
  isn't for sitting on a shelf. It's for action in our homes, workplaces,
  communities, and the wider world (Matt 28:19). God's Word prepares us not just
  for heaven, but for effective service right here, right now.

### Conclusion and Application (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen that we can trust God's Word because it is His
  inspired breath (2 Tim 3:16a). It's profoundly profitable for teaching,
  correcting, and training us (2 Tim 3:16b). And its ultimate purpose is to make
  us complete and fully equipped for every good work He calls us to (2 Tim
  3:17), especially sharing His truth (Matt 28:19-20).
- **Revisiting the Anchor:** The Bible isn't just a book of suggestions; it's
  our divine blueprint, our reliable guide (Ps 119:105), our source of truth
  (John 17:17), and our power for living (Heb 4:12).
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from the Text):**
  1.  **Commit to Daily Illumination:** Make Psalm 119:105 your practice. Spend
      time _daily_ letting God's Word be a lamp to your feet and light to your
      path, even if just for a few minutes.
      `[Write: 1. Daily Light (Ps 119:105)]`
  2.  **Pray for Profitable Application:** Before reading, ask God specifically
      to use His Word for doctrine, reproof, correction, _and_ instruction in
      your life that day (based on 2 Tim 3:16). Be open to how He answers.
      `[Write: 2. Pray 2 Tim 3:16]`
  3.  **Identify Your Next "Good Work":** Reflect on how God might be equipping
      you through His Word (2 Tim 3:17). What is one specific "good work" – an
      act of service, kindness, or sharing truth (Matt 28:19) – you can
      undertake this week, relying on His equipping?
      `[Write: 3. One Good Work (2 Tim 3:17)]`
- **Invitation:** The Word of God stands firm. The question is, will we stand
  _on_ it? Will we trust it, obey it, and allow it to transform and equip us?
  Let's commit today to embracing God's Word not just as true, but as the
  active, life-changing power of God in our lives. (Connect to Closing Hymn:
  "Trust and Obey").
