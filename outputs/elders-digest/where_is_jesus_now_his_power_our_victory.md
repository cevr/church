### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: We often focus on Jesus' birth, death, resurrection, or second coming. But what about *now*? **(RQ)**
- Central Question: Where is Jesus today, and what is He doing? Why does His current activity matter profoundly to us?
- [Write on board: Where is Jesus NOW? What is He DOING?]
- Thesis: Jesus is alive, exalted, and actively ministering from heaven. His present position and work are the source of our spiritual life, power, and victory.
- Briefly outline the study: His position, His work, our connection.

### Section 1: Ascended and Exalted (10 min)

#### The Ascension: A Literal Transition
- Acts 1:9-11: He was visibly taken up; a cloud received Him. Angels promise His literal return in like manner.
- [Whiteboard: Acts 1:9-11 -> Literal Ascension -> Promise of Return]
- Significance: Marked the end of His earthly ministry phase and the beginning of His heavenly High Priestly ministry.

#### Exalted at God's Right Hand: Supreme Authority
- Ephesians 1:20-22 (Central Verse): Seated at the Father's right hand in heavenly places.
    - Position: Far above all earthly and heavenly powers.
    - Role: Head over ALL things *to the church*.
- [Whiteboard: Eph 1:20-22 -> Right Hand = Supreme Authority & Power for the Church]
- Philippians 2:9-11: God highly exalted Him; name above every name.
- Hebrews 1:3: After purging sins, He "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high."
- Matthew 28:18: "All power [authority] is given unto me in heaven and in earth."
- Implication: Christ possesses all authority and sovereignty *right now*. **(RQ)** How does recognizing Christ's current, active authority change how we view challenges and world events?

### Section 2: Christ's Active Heavenly Ministry [*] (12 min)

#### Drawing All People to Himself
- John 12:32: His exaltation (following the cross) draws people.
- His love, sacrifice, and righteousness, presented by the Spirit, attract hearts.

#### Interceding as Advocate and High Priest
- Hebrews 7:25: He *ever lives* to make intercession for those who come to God by Him.
- 1 John 2:1: We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
- [Whiteboard: Heb 7:25 / 1 John 2:1 -> Advocate/Intercessor = Constant Access & Mercy]
- Practical: He represents us based on His perfect life and sacrifice. Assurance for believers.

#### Directing His Church as Head
- Ephesians 1:22-23: He is the Head; the church is His body.
- He guides through the Holy Spirit (John 16:7, 13).
- [Aside: Like a general directing troops from headquarters, Christ guides His church through the Spirit, ensuring the mission advances according to His divine plan.]

#### Building His Church & Preparing Our Home
- Matthew 16:18: "I *will* build my church..." (Ongoing work from heaven).
- John 14:2-3: "I go to prepare a place for you... I will come again."
- [Whiteboard: Matt 16:18 / John 14:2-3 -> Building Church / Preparing Place = Present Work & Future Hope]

### Section 3: Our Victory and Consecration in Christ (12 min)

#### Sharing Christ's Victory: Identification
- Romans 6:4-6: Baptized into His death, raised to walk in newness of life. Our old self was crucified with Him.
- [Whiteboard: Rom 6:4-6 -> Identification -> Shared Death & Resurrection -> New Life]
- We share His victory over:
    - Sin: Reckon yourselves dead to sin, alive to God (Rom 6:11).
    - Satan & World: Faith is the victory (1 John 5:4-5); Overcome by the blood & testimony (Rev 12:11).
    - Death: Thanks be to God who gives us the victory (1 Cor 15:57).
- **(RQ)** If Christ secured this total victory and we are identified with Him, why do we often struggle to experience it?

#### Consecration: Accessing His Power
- The Need: Victory isn't automatic; it requires our cooperation and surrender.
- Romans 12:1-2: Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God... be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
- [Whiteboard: Rom 12:1-2 -> Consecration (Body, Soul, Spirit) -> Transformation & Access to Power]
- Consecration = Yielding fully to God, allowing His power (the Holy Spirit) to work in us.
- Acts 1:8: Power comes *after* the Holy Spirit comes upon us (linked to Christ's ascension/exaltation).
- [Analogy (from Rom 12:1): Consecration is like plugging an appliance into the power source. Christ *is* the power (at God's right hand), consecration connects us to Him.]
- Practical Steps (derived from Rom 12:1-2):
    1.  **Daily Decision:** Consciously yield your will, plans, body to God each morning.
    2.  **Mind Renewal:** Actively replace worldly thoughts with God's Word (Phil 4:8).
    3.  **Living Sacrifice:** View daily duties, interactions, choices as acts of service to God.
- [Aside: Our daily choices are like votes cast, declaring whose side we are on. Consecration means consistently voting for Christ's kingdom in thought, word, and deed, drawing on His heavenly authority.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Significance: His *current* ministry is our lifeline. It's the basis for forgiveness, guidance, strength, and ultimate victory.
- Reiterate Connection: Our victory is real because *He* is victorious. We experience it through faith-driven consecration (Rom 12:1-2).
