### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Ever feel like you're chasing the wind? That life seems repetitive,
  even meaningless sometimes?
- **Relevance:** The ancient book of Ecclesiastes tackles this head-on.
  - Why study this OT book? Because "All scripture is given by inspiration of
    God, and is profitable..." (2 Tim 3:16-17).
    `[Write on board: 2 Tim 3:16-17 - All Scripture Profitable]`
  - It provides learning, admonition, correction, instruction.
- **Author:** Solomon, son of David, king in Jerusalem (Eccl 1:1) - wisest man,
  had everything.
- **Theme Intro:** His experiment - trying to find meaning _purely from an
  earthly perspective_ - 'under the sun'.
  `[Write: 'Under the Sun' = Earthly Perspective]`
- **Purpose of Study:** To understand Solomon's journey from 'vanity' to finding
  true meaning.

### Main Content Section 1: The Search 'Under the Sun' (12 min)

- **Solomon's Premise:** He asks the core question: "What profit hath a man of
  all his labour which he taketh under the sun?" (Eccl 1:3). **(RQ)**
- **The Initial Verdict:** His stark observation: "Vanity of vanities, saith the
  Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity" (Eccl 1:2).
  `[Write: Vanity (Hebel) = Futility, Emptiness, Vapor]`
- **Solomon's Experiments (Seeking Meaning 'Under the Sun'):**
  - **Wisdom & Knowledge:** Solomon sought great wisdom (Eccl 1:16), but found
    "in much wisdom is much grief... he that increaseth knowledge increaseth
    sorrow" (Eccl 1:18). It led to vexation of spirit.
  - **Pleasure, Mirth, Possessions:** He tested life with pleasure, saying "I
    will prove thee with mirth" (Eccl 2:1), acquiring great possessions (Eccl
    2:4-8), but concluded of laughter, "It is mad," and of mirth, "What doeth
    it?" (Eccl 2:2).
  - **Great Works & Building:** He undertook massive projects, building houses
    and planting vineyards (Eccl 2:4-6), seeking fulfillment in accomplishment.
- **The Universal Result:** After surveying all his efforts, Solomon declared:
  "Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought... and, behold, all
  was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun"
  (Eccl 2:11).
  `[Whiteboard: Earthly Pursuits (Wisdom, Pleasure, Work) -> Vanity (Eccl 2:11)]`
- **Key Insight:** The limitation is the perspective: 'under the sun' - life
  viewed without God, without eternity.
- What does this 'under the sun' perspective feel like in our modern lives?
  **(RQ)**

### Main Content Section 2: Glimmers of Truth & Limits of Earthly Wisdom [*] (12 min)

- **Wisdom's Relative Value:** Solomon acknowledges, "Wisdom excelleth folly, as
  far as light excelleth darkness" (Eccl 2:13). But... ultimately, "one event
  happeneth to them all" - the wise man dies just like the fool (Eccl 2:14-16).
  - Earthly wisdom alone doesn't solve the problem of mortality or ultimate
    meaning.
- **God's Sovereignty:** Solomon observes God's overarching plan: "To every
  thing there is a season... He hath made every thing beautiful in his time"
  (Eccl 3:1, 11). `[Whiteboard: God's Timing & Purpose (Eccl 3:1-11)]`
  - Yet, humans cannot fully grasp God's eternal work "from the beginning to the
    end" from an earthly viewpoint (Eccl 3:11b).
- **Words of the Wise:** Scripture offers stability: "The words of the wise are
  as goads, and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies, which are given
  from one shepherd" (Eccl 12:11).
  `[Write: Words of Wise (Eccl 12:11) -> Goads (Provoke) + Nails (Stabilize)]`
  - These words (Scripture) provide direction and stability, unlike shifting
    human philosophies.
  - `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies, God's Word represents the stable truths of heaven in the shifting culture of earth. They anchor us.]`
- **The True Source of Wisdom:** Solomon searched, but true wisdom isn't found
  'under the sun'. It's found in Christ, "In whom are hid all the treasures of
  wisdom and knowledge" (Col 2:3).
  `[Whiteboard: Solomon's Search (Limited) vs. Christ (All Treasures - Col 2:3)]`
- If earthly pursuits, even wisdom, are ultimately 'vanity' without God, where
  must we look? **(RQ)**

### Main Content Section 3: The Conclusion of the Matter (10 min)

- **The Need/Question:** After this exhaustive search, culminating again in
  "Vanity of vanities" (Eccl 12:8), what is the final answer?
- **The Biblical Principle/Solution:** "Let us hear the conclusion of the whole
  matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of
  man" (Eccl 12:13).
  `[Whiteboard: CONCLUSION (Eccl 12:13) = 1. Fear God + 2. Keep Commandments]`
  - 'Fear God': Reverence, awe, submission to His authority.
  - 'Keep Commandments': Practical obedience flowing from reverence.
  - 'Whole Duty': The essence of human purpose and meaning.
- **The Reason:** This matters because "God shall bring every work into
  judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil"
  (Eccl 12:14). `[Whiteboard: Accountability -> Judgment (Eccl 12:14)]`
  - Our lives have eternal significance and accountability.
- **Bridging to Practice:** How does 'fearing God' change our perspective on
  work, family, pleasure, trials – things Solomon found vain 'under the sun'?
  **(RQ)**
  - `[Concept: Shifting perspective from 'under the sun' (earthly, temporary) to 'under God' (eternal, purposeful).]`
    Daily tasks gain meaning when done "unto the Lord" (Col 3:23) and for His
    glory (1 Cor 10:31).
- **Actionable Steps (from Eccl 12:13):**
  1.  **Acknowledge God Daily:** Start the day recognizing His sovereignty and
      seeking His guidance (Connect Prov 3:5-6).
  2.  **Align Choices:** Consciously measure decisions against God's revealed
      will (His commandments found in Scripture).
  3.  **Live Mindfully:** Remember that thoughts and actions have eternal weight
      and will be brought into judgment (Eccl 12:14).
- **Invitation:** Will we continue chasing the wind 'under the sun', or embrace
  the purposeful life found in fearing God and keeping His commandments?

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Solomon's journey: explored everything 'under the sun', found it
  'vanity'. The only lasting meaning comes from looking _above_ the sun, to the
  Creator.
- **Core Message:** Life without God _is_ futile. True meaning, purpose, and
  satisfaction are found only in a right relationship with Him – expressed
  through reverence (fear) and obedience (keeping His commandments).
- **The Ultimate Answer:** While Solomon pointed the way (Eccl 12:13), Jesus
  Christ _is_ the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6), embodying the wisdom
  Solomon sought (Col 2:3) and enabling the obedience God requires.
- **Final Appeal:** Heed the "conclusion of the whole matter" (Eccl 12:13-14).
  Choose today to live a life centered on God, finding true meaning not in the
  fleeting things 'under the sun', but in the eternal reality of His kingdom and
  His standards.
  - `[Brief Illustration Concept: Like a ship without an anchor drifts aimlessly (vanity), a life without God lacks stability and direction. Fearing God and obeying His Word is the anchor.]`
- Let us choose purpose over vanity, eternity over temporality, by trusting and
  obeying our Creator.
