### Introduction (5 min)
-   Start with the common human feeling of worthlessness, inadequacy, being 'broken'.
    -   **(RQ)** Have you ever felt like you weren't good enough? Like you were damaged goods?
-   Contrast this feeling with God's perspective revealed at the cross.
-   Introduce Central Verse: Romans 5:8.
    -   [Write on board: Romans 5:8 - God Commendeth His Love... WHILE WE WERE YET SINNERS]
-   Thesis: Christ didn't die because we were worthy; He died to *show* us our infinite value to God, despite our sin-induced state.

### Section 1: Our Condition Without Christ (10 min)
-   **The Reality of Sin's Effect:**
    -   Describe the state sin leaves us in, using biblical terms.
    -   Read Isaiah 53:3, 6a - Despised, rejected, gone astray.
        -   **(RQ)** How does this description from Isaiah reflect the *feeling* of worthlessness sin creates?
    -   Read Ephesians 2:1-3 - Dead in trespasses, children of wrath.
        -   [Write on board: SIN (Rom 3:23) -> Separation (Isa 59:2) -> Spiritual Death (Eph 2:1)]
    -   This state *feels* worthless from a human perspective, separated from the source of life and value.
-   **The Misconception:** We often think God views us as worthless *because* of this state.
    -   **(RQ)** Do we sometimes project our feelings of inadequacy onto God?

### Section 2: The Infinite Price Paid (12 min)
-   **God's Initiative:**
    -   Revisit Romans 5:8 - "*But God* commendeth..."
    -   Emphasis: God acted *first*, demonstrating love *before* we changed.
-   **The Measure of Value:**
    -   Read 1 Peter 1:18-19 - Redeemed not with silver/gold, but precious blood.
        -   [Write on board: VALUE = PRICE PAID (1 Pet 1:18-19) -> Precious Blood of Christ]
        -   **(RQ)** What does the *cost* Christ paid tell us about how much He *values* us?
    -   [Analogy (from 1 Pet 1:18-19): Redeeming a priceless family heirloom from a pawn shop â€“ you pay what it's *worth to you*, regardless of its current tarnished state. Christ paid the ultimate price because *we* are His treasured possession.]
-   **Sacrifice for the Undeserving:**
    -   Read Isaiah 53:4-6 - He bore *our* griefs, carried *our* sorrows, wounded for *our* transgressions.
        -   [Draw arrow: Our Sin/Worthlessness (Isa 53:6) -> Christ Takes It (Isa 53:4-5) -> His Sacrifice (Rom 5:8)]
    -   The sacrifice wasn't for perfect people, but for sinners (Rom 5:8), demonstrating value placed on the lost.

### Section 3: Our New Identity and Purpose in Christ [*] (12 min)
-   **From Death to Life:**
    -   Read Ephesians 2:4-5 - "But God... rich in mercy... made us alive together with Christ."
    -   Contrast: Dead (v.1) -> Alive (v.5). This is God's doing, based on His love/value for us.
-   **Our True Identity:**
    -   Read 1 John 3:1 - "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons [children] of God..."
        -   [Write on board: Dead (Eph 2:1) -> Alive (Eph 2:5) -> Children of God (1 John 3:1)]
        -   **(RQ)** If the Creator of the Universe calls you His child, how does that redefine your worth?
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our lives, redeemed at such immense cost, are meant to be outposts representing the Kingdom that values every soul this much. We carry the credentials of heaven's love.
-   **Living Out Our Value:**
    -   **Character Building:** Read Ephesians 2:10 - "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works..."
        -   Understanding our value motivates cooperation with God's transforming power. We live *because* we are valued, not *to become* valued.
        -   [Whiteboard: Valued (Rom 5:8) -> New Creation (2 Cor 5:17) -> God's Workmanship (Eph 2:10)]
    -   **Evangelism:** Seeing the price Christ paid for *us* compels us to see the same value in *others*, even those who feel worthless.
        -   [Write Question: How does knowing *your* value in Christ (1 Pet 1:18-19) change how you view the 'worthless' person on the street?]
    -   **Hope in Judgment:** Read Revelation 5:9 - "...for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood..."
        -   Our standing isn't based on our fluctuating feelings of worth, but on the unchanging value demonstrated by Christ's blood. His sacrifice is our plea. [Whiteboard: Hope = Christ's Redeeming Blood (Rev 5:9)]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
-   Recap: Sin makes us *feel* worthless and separates us (Isa 53:6, Eph 2:1). But God, through Christ's immense sacrifice (Rom 5:8, 1 Pet 1:18-19), declares our infinite value to Him.
-   Re-read Romans 5:8.
-   [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Just as Christ took on our 'worthless' human flesh to redeem it, He takes our broken, sin-scarred lives, declares them valuable through His blood, and empowers them for His service (Eph 2:10).
-   **The Invitation:**
    -   Stop defining yourself by sin's effects or feelings of worthlessness.
    -   Accept the value God placed on you at Calvary.
    -   **(RQ)** Will you embrace your identity as a cherished child of God, redeemed by the precious blood of Christ?
    -   Live out this value: Cooperate with His transforming work (character) and share this hope with others who feel worthless (evangelism).
-   Final Prayer: Thanking God for His love that saw value in us even as sinners, asking for help to live in that reality.
