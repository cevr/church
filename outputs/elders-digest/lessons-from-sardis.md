### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the Seven Churches of Revelation - letters from Jesus Himself.
- Focus: Sardis - The Church with a Reputation (Rev 3:1a).
    - Historically, Sardis felt secure, perched high, but was conquered twice by surprise attacks due to lack of watchfulness.
- The Shocking Assessment: "Thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead." (Rev 3:1b)
    - **(RQ)** What does it mean for a church, or an individual, to have a reputation for life but be spiritually dead?
    - `[Write on board: Sardis: Reputation = Alive | Reality = Dead (Rev 3:1)]`

### Section 1: The Dangerous Diagnosis - Indicators of Spiritual Decline (12 min)
- **Christ Knows Our Works (Rev 3:1b):** He sees beyond the surface.
- **Indicators of Spiritual Deadness (Inferred from the warning & context):**
    - **Past over Present:** Living on past glories/experiences, not current relationship. **(RQ)** Are we relying on yesterday's manna?
    - **Reputation over Witness:** More concerned with appearing godly than actually impacting the world for Christ. `[Write on board: Appearance vs. Reality]`
    - **Ritual over Relationship:** Going through motions of religion without heart connection. (Cf. Isaiah 29:13)
    - **Tradition over Spirit-led Life:** Resisting fresh movements of the Holy Spirit because 'we've never done it that way'.
    - **Activity over Connection:** Busy with church programs but lacking deep, personal communion with Jesus. `[Analogy: Like a beautifully decorated car with no engine]`
    - **Talk over Knowledge:** Professing belief without deep, experiential knowledge of God and His Word. (Cf. Titus 1:16)
    - `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. But is the life of the embassy reflecting the King?]`

### Section 2: Christ's Urgent Prescription - Wake Up & Strengthen! [*] (12 min)
- **The Command: "Be watchful..." (Rev 3:2a)**
    - Connects to Sardis' historical vulnerability - spiritual complacency leads to disaster.
    - **(RQ)** Where are the unguarded areas in our spiritual lives?
    - `[Write on board: Command 1: WATCH! (Rev 3:2)]`
- **The Action: "...and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die:" (Rev 3:2b)**
    - Not total destruction yet; embers still glow.
    - Focus on nurturing the remaining sparks of faith, obedience, love.
    - **(RQ)** What 'remains' in our lives/church that needs strengthening before it dies completely?
    - `[Write on board: Command 2: STRENGTHEN! (Rev 3:2)]`
- **The Reason: "...for I have not found thy works perfect before God." (Rev 3:2c)**
    - 'Perfect' (pleróo) - complete, fulfilled. Works lack the fullness that comes from genuine faith and love.
- **The Remedy (Rev 3:3):**
    - **Remember:** Recall foundational truths, first love, God's past leading. `[Whiteboard: Remember (How you received)]`
    - **Hold Fast:** Cling to the Word and truth received. `[Whiteboard: Hold Fast (The Truth)]`
    - **Repent:** Turn away from complacency and deadness. A change of mind leading to a change of action. `[Whiteboard: Repent! (Turn Back)]`
- **The Warning: "If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come on thee as a thief..." (Rev 3:3b)**
    - Not about the *timing* of the Second Coming, but its *unexpectedness* for the spiritually unprepared.
    - `[Metaphor: Like a homeowner asleep while a burglar approaches - unprepared for the encounter.]`

### Section 3: The Faithful Few & Future Hope (10 min)
- **God Always Has a Remnant (Rev 3:4a):** "Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments..."
    - Even in the 'deadest' situations, God preserves a faithful few.
    - Connect to Elijah and the 7,000 (1 Kings 19:18). `[Write on board: God's Remnant (Rev 3:4a; 1 Kings 19:18)]`
    - Encouragement: Don't be discouraged by the majority; faithfulness matters.
- **The Promise to the Faithful Remnant (Rev 3:4b):** "...and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy."
    - **White Garments:** Symbolize purity, imputed righteousness of Christ, victory. (Cf. Rev 7:9, 19:8)
    - **Walk with Christ:** Intimate fellowship and communion.
- **The Promise to the Overcomer (Rev 3:5):**
    - **Clothed in White Raiment:** Assurance of Christ's righteousness covering sin.
    - **Name Not Blotted Out:** Security in the Book of Life, assurance of salvation confirmed in the judgment. (Connects to Investigative Judgment understanding - character revealed).
    - **Confessed Before the Father:** Christ acknowledges the faithful before God and angels. (Cf. Matt 10:32)
    - `[Write on board: Overcomer's Reward (Rev 3:5): White Robes | Secure Name | Divine Acknowledgment]`
    - `[Aside: Instead of spending spiritual energy maintaining a mere facade, we can invest it in genuine connection with Christ. It's like polishing brass versus possessing gold – one shines temporarily, the other has inherent, eternal value.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)
- **Recap:** Sardis' warning - reputation isn't reality. Deadness is a danger.
- **The Choice:** Remain asleep and face unpreparedness, OR heed Christ's call: Watch, Strengthen, Remember, Hold Fast, Repent.
- **The Hope:** Even amidst decline, God has His faithful. The promises to the overcomer are glorious and secure.
- **Personal Application:**
    - **(RQ)** Honestly assess: Are my spiritual 'works' born from relationship or ritual?
    - **(RQ)** What one thing 'remains' that I need to strengthen this week through God's power?
    - **Action Step:** Commit to 15 minutes daily this week focused solely on 'remembering' God's goodness and 'holding fast' to a specific promise in His Word.
- **Final Invitation:** Heed the Spirit's call (Rev 3:6 - "He that hath an ear..."). Choose life, true spiritual vitality found only in Christ.
- Closing Prayer
