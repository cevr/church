### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer

  (Dan 3:1).
- The Core Conflict Introduced: A test of loyalty â€“ God vs. State, True Worship
  vs. False Worship.

  in worship, where does our ultimate allegiance lie? **(RQ)**
- Introduce Central Verse: Daniel 3:17-18 - The stand of faith.

### Section 1: The Command & The Counterfeit (10 min)

- **The King's Decree:** The golden image, mandatory worship (Dan 3:1-6).
  - [Whiteboard: Image (Human Authority) vs. God's Command (Ex 20:3-5)]
- **Satan's Strategy: The Counterfeit:** For every truth, a counterfeit.
  - False worship systems mimic elements of truth but divert allegiance from
    God.
  - This image demanded worship due _man_, not God.
  - [Whiteboard: True Worship (God-centered, Spirit & Truth - John 4:24) vs.
    False Worship (Man-centered, Form over Substance)]
- **The Pressure to Conform:** Music, crowd psychology, threat of death (Dan
  3:7, 11).
  - How does societal pressure influence our choices today? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Choice & The Commitment (12 min) [*]

- **The Accusation:** Faithful Hebrews identified (Dan 3:8-12).
- **The Confrontation:** King's anger, opportunity to recant (Dan 3:13-15).
- **The Unwavering Response:** Immediate, decisive commitment (Dan 3:16-18).
  - No hesitation, no negotiation, no compromise.
  - Principle: Obedience to God > Human Commands (Acts 5:29).
    - [Whiteboard: Acts 5:29 - "We ought to obey God rather than men."]
  - Why is immediate commitment crucial when facing temptation/pressure?
    **(RQ)**
  - Procrastination opens the door to doubt and compromise.
- **Faith Defined:** Trust in God's _ability_ and _sovereignty_, regardless of
  the outcome ("But if not...").
  - [Aside: True faith rests not on guaranteed outcomes, but on the unchanging
    character of God. It's trusting the Promiser even when the promise seems
    distant.]

### Section 3: The Furnace & The Fourth Man (12 min)

- **The King's Fury & The Sentence:** Furnace heated seven times (Dan 3:19-23).
  - The cost of faithfulness can appear extreme.
- **God's Presence in the Trial:** Not deliverance _from_ the fire, but presence
  _in_ the fire.
  - [Whiteboard: God WITH US (Isa 43:2) -> The Fire] vs. [God -> (stops) Fire]
  - The astonishing sight: Four men, unbound, walking in the fire (Dan 3:24-25).
- **The Divine Companion:** "the form of the fourth is like the Son of God" (Dan
  3:25).
  - Jesus Christ is present with His people in their deepest trials.
  - [Whiteboard: Isaiah 41:10 - "Fear not, for I am with you..."]

    **(RQ)**

    Cast your cares).
    - [Whiteboard: 1 Peter 5:7 - Cast cares -> He cares]
  - **God's Presence Assured:** He is _with_ us in trials (Isa 41:10).
  - **Trust His Purpose:** Even difficult experiences work for good for those
    who love Him (Rom 8:28).
    - [Whiteboard: Rom 8:28 - Trials -> God's Purpose -> Good]
    - [Analogy (from text): Like gold refined by fire, trials under God's care
      purify character.]
- **Practical Application:**
  1.  **Identify:** Where are the subtle pressures to compromise
      worship/obedience in your life? **(RQ)**
  2.  **Commit:** Reaffirm your decision to obey God rather than men (Acts
      5:29), especially in small things.
  3.  **Trust:** Consciously cast your anxieties on God during trials,
      remembering His presence (1 Pet 5:7, Isa 41:10).

  power, even when facing the fire. He is able, and He is with you.
