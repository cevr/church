### Introduction (6 min)

-   **Hook:** Life is short. How do we ensure we're living the *best* of it?
    -   Reference Ps 90:12 - The wisdom of recognizing brevity.
    -   **(RQ):** What truly makes a life 'the best'? Worldly success or something deeper?
-   **Core Message:** Jesus gives the key to the best life: Seeking God *first*.
    -   Introduce Central Verse: Matthew 6:33.
    -   [Write on board: Title + Matt 6:33]
-   **Roadmap:** Today we'll explore *what* it means to seek God's Kingdom and His Righteousness first, and *how* to do it practically.

### Section 1: The Urgency and Nature of Seeking (10 min)

-   **Why Seek First? Life's Brevity Demands Priority.** (Ps 90:12)
    -   [Whiteboard: Ps 90:12 - "Teach us to number our days -> Apply hearts unto wisdom"]
    -   Explain: 'Numbering days' isn't morbid, but motivates wise living and right priorities.
    -   **(RQ):** If we truly grasped life's shortness (James 4:14), how would our daily choices change?
-   **How to Seek? Actively, Continuously, Wholeheartedly.** (Jer 29:13)
    -   [Whiteboard: Jer 29:13 - "Seek Me -> Find Me WHEN Search with ALL your heart"]
    -   Contrast passive acknowledgment with active, intentional seeking.
    -   It requires effort, focus, and our *whole* being – not just leftover time/energy.
    -   **(RQ):** What practical steps show we are searching for God 'with all our heart' this week?
    -   [Brief Illustration Concept (from Jer 29:13): Like searching for a priceless lost pearl – diligent, focused, valuing it above distractions.]

### Section 2: Seeking the Kingdom and the King [*] (10 min)

-   **What to Seek First (Part 1): The Kingdom of God.** (Matt 6:33a)
    -   [Whiteboard: "Seek FIRST the Kingdom of God..."]
    -   Define: God's rule, His reign, His government – not just a future place, but His authority in our lives *now*. (Luke 17:21)
    -   **(RQ):** In what areas of life do we resist God's 'government' and prefer self-rule?
-   **Seeking the King Means Preeminence.**
    -   He must be #1 in *all* areas:
        -   **Time:** Prioritizing communion with Him & His work. (Eph 5:16)
        -   **Resources:** Using finances/talents for His glory. (1 Pet 4:10-11)
        -   **Decisions:** Consulting His Word and Spirit first. (Prov 3:5-6)
    -   [Whiteboard: KINGDOM = God's Rule -> Requires His Preeminence: Time | Resources | Decisions]
-   **Seeking the King Includes:**
    -   His **Glory:** Living to reflect well on Him. (1 Cor 10:31)
    -   His **Guidance:** Depending on His wisdom daily. (Ps 32:8)
    -   His **Government:** Joyful submission to His will/law. (John 14:15)
    -   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Our individual lives should be the same.]

### Section 3: Seeking His Righteousness (12 min)

-   **What to Seek First (Part 2): His Righteousness.** (Matt 6:33b)
    -   [Whiteboard: "...and His Righteousness"]
    -   Define: God's perfect character, His way of being right and doing right. (Ps 119:142)
    -   Contrast with self-righteousness (Isa 64:6) – our efforts fall short.
    -   The Need: We must *hunger and thirst* for *His* righteousness. (Matt 5:6)
    -   **(RQ):** How does Matt 5:20 (righteousness exceeding Pharisees) highlight the need for *God's* righteousness, not just rule-keeping?
-   **Foundation: Righteousness Must Be *Imputed* (Received by Faith).**
    -   Explain Imputation: God credits Christ's perfect righteousness to believers. (Rom 4:5-8)
    -   [Write on board: 2 Cor 5:21 - Christ became sin -> We become God's righteousness IN HIM]
    -   [Write on board: Phil 3:9 - Goal: Found IN HIM, having righteousness FROM GOD through FAITH]
    -   This is a gift, not earned. It's the *only* way to meet God's standard.
    -   **(RQ):** Why is understanding imputed righteousness crucial before trying to 'live righteously'?
-   **Fruit: Righteousness Is *Imparted* (Lived Out Through Abiding).**
    -   Explain Impartation: The Holy Spirit works God's character *into* us as we stay connected to Christ. (John 15:4-5)
    -   [Whiteboard: Imputed Righteousness (Gift/Foundation) -> Imparted Righteousness (Growth/Fruit)]
    -   'Depicting' righteousness (living it out) flows *from* being declared righteous in Christ.
    -   [Analogy (from John 15): A branch doesn't strain to produce fruit; it bears fruit naturally by *abiding* in the vine. Our righteous living flows from abiding in Christ.]
    -   Seeking His righteousness means seeking *Him* and allowing His Spirit to transform us. (Gal 5:22-25)

### Conclusion and Appeal (7 min)

-   **The Promise: God Provides for Those Who Prioritize Him.** (Matt 6:33c)
    -   [Whiteboard: Matt 6:33 -> Seek FIRST Kingdom & Righteousness = "All these things ADDED"]
    -   Reiterate: God promises to meet the essential needs (food, clothing, etc. - context of Matt 6) of those whose primary focus is His Kingdom and Character.
    -   This builds trust and frees us from anxiety about temporal things. (Phil 4:19)
    -   **(RQ):** How does this promise change how we view work, finances, and daily worries?
-   **Summary:** The 'best life' isn't defined by the world's standards, but by God's priorities. Seeking His Rule (Kingdom) and His Character (Righteousness) *first* is the path to true fulfillment and eternal security.
-   [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season [or our resources generally] to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Prioritizing Him opens doors for impact.]
-   **Appeal:**
    -   Where is God calling you to seek Him *first* more intentionally?
    -   Is it in your time? Your decisions? Your desire for His character?
    -   Choose one specific step this week to actively seek His Kingdom and Righteousness above other pursuits.
    -   Invitation to prayer/commitment to make Him truly first.
