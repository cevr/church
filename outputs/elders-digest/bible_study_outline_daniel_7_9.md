### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Imagine having a map of future world history, given centuries in
  advance. God provided one!
- Introduce Daniel 7-9: God's detailed prophetic outline, focusing on the
  longest time prophecy.
- Theme: God's absolute foreknowledge, His control over history, and His
  ultimate plan centered in Christ and His sanctuary ministry. (Isa 46:9-10)
- Purpose: To understand this crucial prophecy (Dan 8:14) and its profound
  meaning for us living in the end times.

### Section 1: Empires in Prophecy (Daniel 7 & 8) (10 min)

- **Daniel 7: The Four Beasts**
  - Succession of World Powers revealed to Daniel: Babylon (Lion), Medo-Persia
    (Bear), Greece (Leopard), Rome (Dreadful Beast) (Dan 7:1-7).
  - [Whiteboard: List Kingdoms & Symbols + Dan 7 refs]
  - Focus shifts to the 4th Beast (Rome) & the unique "Little Horn" power
    arising from it (Dan 7:8, 19-25).
- **The Little Horn Power (Daniel 7 & 8)**
  - Key Characteristics: Different from others, speaks great blasphemies against
    God, persecutes God's saints, attempts to change God's times and laws (Dan
    7:24-25).
  - [Whiteboard: Little Horn Traits (Dan 7:25)]
  - Daniel 8 Confirms: Ram (Medo-Persia), Goat (Greece), Little Horn (Rome -
    Pagan & Papal phases identified by its actions) (Dan 8:3-12, 20-25).
  - Its Actions: Magnifies itself against Christ ('Prince of the host'), attacks
    God's People ('host'), Truth ('cast down the truth'), and the Sanctuary
    ministry ('place of his sanctuary was cast down') (Dan 8:10-12, 24-25).
  - **(RQ)** Seeing its actions described here (Dan 7:25, 8:11-12), how does
    this power directly oppose God's authority and Christ's work?

### Section 2: Unlocking the Time Prophecies (Daniel 8 & 9) (12 min) [*]

- **The 2300-Day Question (Daniel 8:13-14)**
  - The Vision's Climax: "Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall
    the sanctuary be cleansed." (Dan 8:14). This is the central time prophecy.
  - Daniel Needs Understanding: The vision, especially the time element,
    troubled Daniel and wasn't fully explained initially (Dan 8:26-27).
- **Daniel 9 Provides the Key**
  - Gabriel Returns: The angel Gabriel comes specifically to give Daniel "skill
    and understanding" regarding the vision (Dan 9:21-23).
  - The 70 Weeks Explained (Daniel 9:24-27): A period "determined" (Hebrew:
    _chatak_ - "cut off" or "decreed") for the Jewish people and Jerusalem, cut
    off from the longer 2300-day period. (Dan 9:24).
  - [Whiteboard: 2300 days -> 70 weeks (490 days) "cut off"]
  - Starting Point is Crucial: The countdown begins with the decree to restore
    and build Jerusalem (Dan 9:25). This decree by Artaxerxes in 457 BC is
    historically verifiable. [Aside: Historical dating of Artaxerxes' decree
    (Ezra 7) provides a solid, non-biblical anchor point for this crucial
    prophecy.]
  - Day-Year Principle: In symbolic prophecy, a day represents a literal year
    (Num 14:34, Ezek 4:6). [Illustration: Think of it like a map scale; 1 inch =
    1 mile. Here, 1 prophetic day = 1 literal year.]
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Prophetic Day = 1 Literal Year]
  - Calculations: 2300 prophetic days = 2300 literal years. 70 weeks = 490
    prophetic days = 490 literal years.
  - Fulfilled Milestones within the 70 Weeks (Dan 9:25-27):
    - Messiah's Arrival: 69 weeks (483 years) from 457 BC points to AD 27
      (Jesus' baptism).
    - Messiah "Cut Off": In the middle of the 70th week (AD 31 - Crucifixion).
    - End of Special Covenant with Israel: End of the 70th week (AD 34 - Stoning
      of Stephen, gospel goes to Gentiles).
  - **(RQ)** How does the precise historical fulfillment of the 70-week prophecy
    (Dan 9:24-27) give us confidence in the accuracy and divine origin of the
    larger 2300-year timeline?

### Section 3: The Sanctuary Cleansed (Meaning of 1844) (10 min)

- **Calculating the End Point:** Starting from the decree in 457 BC and
  extending 2300 years brings us to AD 1844. (Dan 8:14).
- [Whiteboard: 457 BC + 2300 Years = AD 1844]
- **Which Sanctuary?** The earthly sanctuary was destroyed in AD 70. Hebrews
  reveals Christ ministers in the _Heavenly_ Sanctuary, the true tabernacle (Heb
  8:1-2, 9:11-12, 9:24).
- **What is "Cleansing"?** The earthly sanctuary had a Day of Atonement (_Yom
  Kippur_) where the sanctuary was cleansed symbolically (Lev 16). This involved
  judgment, atonement, and the final removal of confessed sins.
- **The Heavenly Cleansing:** Beginning in 1844, Christ entered the final phase
  of His High Priestly ministry in the Most Holy Place of the Heavenly Sanctuary
  (cf. Rev 11:19). This work involves an "Investigative Judgment" â€“ a review of
  the records of all who have ever professed faith in God, before Christ
  returns. (Heb 9:23).
- [Illustration: Similar to how a business balances its books at year-end to see
  the true financial state, God reviews the life records ('books' - Rev 20:12)
  of professed believers during this judgment to reveal who, through faith in
  Christ, is prepared for eternal life.]
- Significance for Us: This marks the beginning of the pre-advent investigative
  judgment, determining who is sealed and ready for Christ's second coming (Mal
  3:1-3, 1 Pet 4:17, Rev 14:6-7 - First Angel's Message: "the hour of His
  judgment is come").
- **(RQ)** If the earthly sanctuary service was a shadow pointing to Christ's
  work (Heb 8:5), what does the cleansing of the _heavenly_ sanctuary (Heb 9:23)
  tell us about the seriousness and finality of God's plan for dealing with sin
  before Jesus returns?

### Conclusion & Appeal (8 min)

- Summary: We've traced God's prophetic roadmap through Daniel 7-9, seeing His
  foreknowledge of empires, the rise of an opposing power, and the precise
  timeline leading to Christ's ministry and the final phase of His work: the
  cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary beginning in 1844.
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - **Need/Question (from text):** Knowing that we are living in the time of
    this heavenly cleansing, this final Day of Atonement ministry (Dan 8:14, Heb
    9:23-24), how should this reality impact our daily lives?
  - **Biblical Principle (from text):** God calls us to be sober, vigilant, and
    faithful, fully trusting in Christ our High Priest who intercedes for us,
    knowing that judgment is occurring now in heaven (Heb 4:14-16, 1 Pet 4:17,
    Rev 14:7).
  - **Bridging (from text):** Just as the Israelites were to afflict their souls
    and ensure they were right with God on the earthly Day of Atonement (Lev
    16:29-31), we are called today to examine our hearts, confess our sins, and
    fully rely on Christ's merits during this antitypical Day of Atonement (1
    John 1:9, Heb 10:19-22). [Aside: The Investigative Judgment isn't about
    earning salvation through works; it's about revealing who, by genuine faith,
    has truly accepted and remained in Christ's offered salvation.]
  - **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Study Deeper:** Prayerfully study the Sanctuary message, especially in
        Hebrews 8-10, to better understand Christ's current ministry.
    2.  **Live Faithfully:** Surrender daily to Christ, confess known sins
        promptly, and claim His power for victory over sin (1 John 1:9, Jude
        24).
    3.  **Share Urgently:** Proclaim the Three Angels' Messages (Rev 14:6-12),
        including the call to worship God because the hour of His judgment _has_
        come.
  - **Invitation:** This prophecy isn't meant to frighten, but to assure us of
    God's control and Christ's ongoing work for our salvation. Will you choose
    today to place your complete trust in Jesus, our High Priest in the heavenly
    sanctuary, confessing your sins and living in readiness for His soon return?
    (Heb 10:19-23).
- Final Thought: God's longest prediction points to His ultimate victory and
  invites us to be part of His eternal kingdom. Let us respond with faith and
  obedience.
