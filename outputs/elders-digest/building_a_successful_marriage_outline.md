### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with a common challenge or question about modern marriage success rates. Contrast with God's ideal. "Why do so many marriages struggle today?"
-   **The Divine Origin:** Marriage isn't man-made, but God-designed from the beginning (Gen 1:27-28 - created male and female; Gen 2:18 - not good for man to be alone; Gen 2:21-24 - God formed Eve and brought her to Adam).
-   **Central Truth:** Introduce the core idea â€“ true success requires building according to God's blueprint, not human wisdom alone.
-   **Central Verse:** Read Matthew 19:6. `[Write on board: Matthew 19:6 - God Joins = Permanent]` Emphasize God's active role.
-   **Outline Preview:** Briefly state the main points: God's design for permanence and faithfulness, His order for cooperation and love, His foundation in Christ, and His purpose for marriage.

### Section 1: God's Design - Permanence & Faithfulness (10 min)

-   **Leaving and Cleaving (Gen 2:24):**
    -   Explain the significance: Priority shift (leaving parents), establishing a new primary loyalty, deep bonding ("cleave" - like glue), becoming "one flesh" (Gen 2:24).
    -   `[Write on board: Gen 2:24 - Leave -> Cleave -> One Flesh]`
    -   Permanence intended from the start. **(RQ)** How does understanding marriage as God's *joining* (Matt 19:6) reinforce the idea of permanence found in Genesis?
    -   God hates divorce (Malachi 2:16 - "For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away"). This reflects His desire for covenant faithfulness.
-   **Honourable Commitment (Hebrews 13:4):**
    -   "Marriage is honourable in all" - It's a high calling, divinely sanctioned (Heb 13:4a).
    -   "and the bed undefiled" - Requires exclusive faithfulness and purity within the marriage covenant (Heb 13:4b).
    -   `[Aside: The term "undefiled" here strongly implies sexual faithfulness, a cornerstone of the covenant relationship mirroring God's faithfulness to His people.]`
    -   God holds accountable those who violate this sacred trust ("whoremongers and adulterers God will judge" - Heb 13:4c).

### Section 2: God's Order - Cooperation & Mutual Love [*] (12 min)

-   **Foundation: Mutual Submission in Christ (Eph 5:21):**
    -   The context for roles begins with "Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God" (Eph 5:21). This isn't about hierarchy primarily, but mutual respect flowing from reverence for Christ.
-   **Wives' Role: Respectful Cooperation (Eph 5:22-24):**
    -   "Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord" (Eph 5:22). This submission is modeled on the church's relationship to Christ (Eph 5:23-24).
    -   It implies willing cooperation, respect for his God-given responsibility, not inferiority or blind obedience. `[Write on board: Eph 5:22-24 - Wife -> Respectful Cooperation (as unto the Lord)]`
-   **Husbands' Role: Sacrificial Love (Eph 5:25-33):**
    -   "Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it" (Eph 5:25). This is the defining command.
    -   Love means: Sacrificial action (v.25), nurturing spiritual growth (v.26-27), cherishing as one's own body (v.28-29), deep intimacy and unity (v.31, quoting Gen 2:24).
    -   `[Write on board: Eph 5:25, 28 - Husband -> Sacrificial Love (as Christ loved)]`
    -   **(RQ)** How does the command for husbands to love sacrificially balance and define the call for wives' respectful cooperation?
-   **Illustration:** Think of two pillars supporting an arch. Both are essential, distinct, and work together under the keystone (Christ) to bear the load. Neither is less important, but they function cooperatively.

### Section 3: God's Foundation - Christ-Centered Living (12 min)

-   **Building on the Rock (Matthew 7:24-25):**
    -   Jesus contrasts the wise builder (hears and does His sayings) with the foolish builder (hears and does not) (Matt 7:24, 26).
    -   The "Rock" is Christ and obedience to His Word (Matt 7:24). A marriage built here withstands storms (Matt 7:25).
    -   `[Write on board: Matt 7:24-25 - Foundation = Christ & His Word]`
    -   **(RQ)** What are practical ways a couple can ensure they are building their marriage "upon the rock" daily or weekly?
-   **Practical Elements of a Christ-Centered Home:**
    -   **Shared Devotion:** Praying together, studying the Bible together (Acts 17:11 - searching scriptures daily).
    -   **Shared Faith:** Attending church together, aligning life goals with God's will (Amos 3:3 - "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?").
    -   **Christ as Head:** Consciously making Christ the ultimate authority in decisions and conflict resolution (Col 3:17 - "whatsoever ye do... do all in the name of the Lord Jesus").
    -   `[Aside: Ellen White often emphasized the home altar, family worship, as the spiritual heartbeat of a Christian family, essential for building on the Rock. See *Adventist Home*, Ch. 81.]`

### Conclusion: God's Purpose - Forgiveness, Growth & Witness (6 min)

-   **Need/Question (from text):** We see God's high ideal, but we are imperfect humans living in a fallen world. How do we handle inevitable failures and friction? (Reflects human reality vs. divine standard in Eph 5, Matt 19).
-   **Biblical Principle (from text):** God calls us to grace and forgiveness within marriage. "Be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (Ephesians 4:32).
-   **Bridging (from text):** Just as Christ's love and forgiveness are the foundation of our relationship with God (Eph 4:32b), they must be the foundation of our marriage relationship (Eph 4:32a). This reflects the character of God.
-   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Practice Kindness Daily:** Intentionally speak and act kindly, even when difficult (Eph 4:32a).
    2.  **Forgive Quickly:** Choose to forgive as Christ forgave you, not holding grudges (Eph 4:32b; Col 3:13).
    3.  **Seek God Together:** Recommit to building on the Rock through shared prayer and study (Matt 7:24-25).
-   **Invitation:** Let's ask God to help us build (or rebuild) our marriages according to His perfect, loving blueprint, reflecting His grace and commitment to the world. A strong, Christ-centered marriage is a powerful witness (cf. John 13:35 - love for one another shows discipleship).
