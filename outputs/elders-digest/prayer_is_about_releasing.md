### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: The Lord's Prayer - familiar, yet profound. Focus on one challenging
  phrase: "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors." (Matt 6:12)
- Prayer isn't just asking; it's also about _releasing_.
  - Releasing our sins to God (Confession).
  - Releasing others from their offenses against us (Forgiveness).
- Central Theme: True prayer involves acknowledging our need for God's
  forgiveness and extending that same forgiveness to others – a vital aspect of
  reflecting God's character, especially as we near Christ's return.
- (RQ) Do we truly understand the connection Jesus makes here, and its
  implications for our sanctification?

### Section 1: Understanding Our Debt Before God (10 min)

- **What is 'Debt' in Prayer?**
  - Sin is presented as a debt owed to God's justice and holiness (Matt 6:12).
  - Biblical definition of sin: "Sin is the transgression of the law." (1 John
    3:4). It's falling short of God's perfect standard of righteousness.
  - [Whiteboard: SIN = DEBT (Matt 6:12) -> Transgression of Law (1 John 3:4)]
- **The Reality of Sin in the Believer:**
  - We are saved by grace, yet still struggle with sin. Acknowledging this is
    crucial for growth.
  - Scriptural honesty: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves..."
    (1 John 1:8, 10).
  - Paul's struggle reflects ours (Romans 7:14-25) – part of the Great
    Controversy playing out within us.
  - (RQ) Why is it sometimes hard for Christians, even Adventists awaiting
    Christ's return, to admit ongoing struggles with sin?
  - _“We cannot conceal our sins from God. We may forget them, but He never
    forgets.”_ (EGW, _Steps to Christ_, p. 37 - paraphrase for brevity, check
    context).
- **The Consequence of Unconfessed Sin:**
  - Our greatest need: God's forgiveness through Christ.
  - Sin damages daily fellowship and hinders prayer: "Your iniquities have
    separated you from your God..." (Isaiah 59:2). This separation grieves the
    Holy Spirit, hindering His work of sanctification in us.
  - [Whiteboard: Sin (Isa 59:2) -> Separation -> Hindered Prayer &
    Sanctification]

### Section 2: The Path to Release - Honest Confession (10 min) [*]

- **What is True Confession?**
  - More than just saying sorry. It's agreeing with God about our specific sin,
    acknowledging its violation of His law, and turning from it.
  - Biblical standard: "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to
    forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John
    1:9).
  - [Whiteboard: Confession (1 John 1:9) = Agreeing with God (re: Law) +
    Receiving Cleansing]
  - _“True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowledges
    particular sins... General confessions of sin... bring the soul no relief.”_
    (EGW, _Steps to Christ_, p. 38 - paraphrase/concept).
- **Judging Ourselves:**
  - Confession involves judging the sin in our own lives, taking God's side
    against it, before the final judgment.
  - "For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged." (1 Corinthians
    11:31-32).
  - (RQ) How does 'judging ourselves' in confession prepare us for the
    Investigative Judgment?
- **The Promise of Forgiveness & Cleansing:**
  - Based on God's faithfulness and justice, secured by Christ's sacrifice (His
    blood cleanses - 1 John 1:7).
  - Leads to cleansing (1 John 1:9) – part of the ongoing work of
    sanctification, fitting us for heaven.

### Section 3: The Condition for Release - Forgiving Others (12 min)

- **The Explicit Connection:**
  - Jesus links receiving forgiveness directly to giving it (Matt 6:12). This
    isn't earning salvation, but demonstrating that God's grace has truly
    transformed our hearts.
  - He emphasizes it immediately: "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your
    heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their
    trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." (Matthew
    6:14-15).
  - [Whiteboard: God Forgives Us -> Evidence: We Forgive Others (Matt 6:14-15)]
- **The Divine Command and Model:**
  - We forgive _because_ God first forgave us through Christ. This reflects His
    character.
  - "...be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as
    God in Christ forgave you." (Ephesians 4:32).
  - (RQ) How does remembering the immense debt God forgave us in Christ (cf.
    Matt 18 parable) motivate us to forgive the comparatively smaller debts
    others owe us?
  - _“We are not forgiven because we forgive, but as we forgive. The ground of
    all forgiveness is found in the unmerited love of God, but by our attitude
    toward others we show whether we have made that love our own.”_ (EGW,
    _Christ’s Object Lessons_, p. 251).
- **The Danger of Unforgiveness:**
  - Illustrated powerfully in the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew
    18:21-35).
  - The stark warning: "So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of
    you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses." (Matthew
    18:35).
  - Unforgiveness blocks our relationship with God, grieves the Holy Spirit (Eph
    4:30-32), and hinders the development of a Christ-like character needed for
    the final days.
  - [Aside: Unforgiveness is like drinking poison and expecting the other person
    to die. It primarily harms the one holding the grudge, damaging their
    spiritual health and giving Satan an advantage in the Great Controversy
    battle for our souls.]

### Section 4: Releasing Offenses and Finding Freedom (3 min)

- **Letting Go of Vengeance:**
  - Forgiveness involves releasing the offense and the offender to God, trusting
    His ultimate justice.
  - Trusting God's justice: "Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give
    place to wrath; for it is written, ‘Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,’ says
    the Lord." (Romans 12:19). This aligns us with God's character of justice
    and mercy.
  - [Whiteboard: Release Offense -> Trust God's Justice (Rom 12:19)]
- **Forgiveness and Character Perfection:**
  - Forgiving others is essential for sanctification; it is evidence of Christ's
    character being formed in us, preparing us to stand without fault before Him
    (cf. Jude 24).
  - [Analogy: Holding onto bitterness is like carrying heavy baggage that weighs
    us down spiritually. Forgiveness sets *us* free to grow in grace.]

### Conclusion and Practical Application (5 min)

- Recap: Prayer is fundamentally about release – releasing our confessed sins
  (transgressions of God's Law) to God and releasing others through forgiveness,
  based on the model of Christ's sacrifice and essential for reflecting His
  character.
- This isn't optional; it's central to the Christian life, our relationship with
  God, and our preparation for His coming (Matt 6:14-15).
- **Practical Steps:**
  1.  **Daily, Specific Confession:** Agree with God about specific sins
      (violations of His Law - 1 John 1:9) and claim His cleansing power for
      sanctification.
  2.  **Active Forgiveness:** Consciously choose to forgive those who wrong you,
      releasing them to God as an act of faith and obedience (Eph 4:32; Rom
      12:19). Ask God for the strength only He can give.
  3.  **Refuse Bitterness:** Guard your heart against resentment, recognizing it
      as a tool of the enemy to hinder your spiritual growth (Heb 12:15).
- [Aside: Just as ancient Israelites confessed sins over the sanctuary scapegoat
  (Lev 16), symbolizing transfer, our confession transfers sin to Christ, our
  Substitute. Forgiving others reflects our acceptance of His substitutionary
  work and allows His character to be perfected in us.]
- Invitation: Embrace the freedom found in receiving God's forgiveness and
  extending it to others. Let this aspect of prayer transform your relationship
  with God and prepare you more fully for His soon return.
