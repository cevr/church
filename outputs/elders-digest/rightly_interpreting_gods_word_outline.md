### Introduction (5 min)
- **Hook:** Start with a common scenario of biblical misunderstanding or misapplication. **(RQ)** Have you ever heard Scripture used in a way that didn't seem right?
- **Relevance:** Why accurate interpretation matters – foundation for faith, practice, and avoiding error (Matt 22:29).
- **Introduce Central Verse:** 2 Timothy 2:15. This isn't just a suggestion; it's a command with eternal implications.
    - [Write on board: 2 Timothy 2:15 - Study | Approved | Workman | Not Ashamed | Rightly Dividing]
- **Outline Preview:** We need the right heart, the right approach, and the right principles to handle God's Word accurately.

### Section 1: The Right Heart - Foundation for Understanding (8 min)
- **Point:** Interpretation starts *before* we open the Book – with our attitude towards God and His Word.
- **Requirement 1: Diligence & Approval (2 Tim 2:15a):** Not casual reading, but earnest *study* seeking God's approval, not man's.
    - Link to Jeremiah 29:13 (Seek with whole heart).
    - **(RQ)** What does it mean to be 'approved unto God' in our study?
- **Requirement 2: Unashamed Workman (2 Tim 2:15b):** Requires effort, skill, and commitment. Not afraid of the 'hard work'.
- **Requirement 3: Rooted in Faith & Surrender (Heb 11:6):** Must believe God *is* and approach His Word expecting to hear from Him and obey.
    - **Crucial Warning (EGW):**
        - [Read/Paraphrase Steps to Christ, p. 110]: Approaching Scripture without reverence, prayer, and a will fixed on God leads to doubt.

### Section 2: The Right Approach - 'Cutting Straight' (8 min)
- **Point:** The core command in 2 Tim 2:15c is to "rightly divide" (KJV) or "correctly handle" (NIV) the Word.
- **Meaning of "Rightly Dividing":** Accurately discerning and presenting the truth. Avoiding distortion, misapplication, or taking verses out of context.
    - `[Aside: The Greek word here for 'rightly dividing,' *orthotomeō*, literally means 'to cut straight.' It was used for cutting roads, plowing furrows, or stonemasonry – all requiring precision.]`
    - `[Illustration: Think of a skilled carpenter cutting wood. To build something strong and true, every cut must be precise and straight. 'Rightly dividing' God's Word is like that – handling it accurately so the 'building' of our faith and understanding is sound.]`
- **Dependence on the Holy Spirit (John 16:13):** We cannot do this alone. Jesus promised the Spirit would guide us into *all* truth. Prayer for guidance is essential *before* and *during* study.
    - [Write on board: Holy Spirit = Guide into Truth]
- **(RQ)** How does relying on the Spirit change how we approach difficult passages?

### Section 3: Sound Principles for Interpretation [*] (12 min)
- **Principle 1: Scripture Interprets Scripture (Isa 28:10, 13):** The Bible is its own best interpreter. Compare scripture with scripture.
    - "Precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little, there a little." Gather all relevant texts on a topic.
    - Avoid building doctrine on isolated texts.
    - [Write on board: Isa 28:10 - Precept + Precept | Line + Line]
- **Principle 2: No Private Interpretation (2 Peter 1:20-21):** Scripture's meaning isn't based on personal opinion or feeling. It originated with God through the Holy Spirit.
    - `[Aside: It's remarkable how over 40 authors, across 1500 years, penned books that harmonize so perfectly. This consistency itself is evidence supporting Peter's point about the Holy Spirit's guidance (2 Peter 1:21).]`
    - Our understanding must align with the overall testimony of Scripture, guided by the Spirit.
- **Principle 3: Consider Context:** Historical, literary (genre), immediate (surrounding verses), and overall biblical context.
    - **(RQ)** Why is ignoring context dangerous when reading the Bible? (Example: Matt 7:1 "Judge not" used to silence all discernment).
- **Principle 4: Christ-Centered Focus (Luke 24:27, 44):** Jesus is the central theme of all Scripture. Look for how passages point to Him and His plan of salvation.

### Section 4: Practical Application & Call (7 min)
- **Need/Question (from text):** We've seen the command to study and handle truth accurately (2 Tim 2:15). How do we move from *knowing* this to *doing* it?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** True understanding leads to transformation and action (James 1:22 - "Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.")
    - [Write on board: Hearers -> Doers (James 1:22)]
- **Bridging (from text):** Our study isn't just academic; it's meant to shape our lives, beliefs, and witness. Accurate handling protects us and others from error (1 Tim 4:16).
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Pray:** Before opening the Word, ask the Holy Spirit for guidance (John 16:13).
    2.  **Compare:** When studying a topic, look up multiple related verses (Isa 28:10). Use a concordance.
    3.  **Apply:** Ask "What does this passage require of me?" and seek to obey (James 1:22).
- **Invitation:** Let's commit to being diligent workmen, approved by God, handling His precious Word with the care and accuracy it deserves. Let it be a lamp to *our* feet and a light to *our* path (Psalm 119:105).

### Conclusion (5 min)
- **Recap:** We need the right heart (diligent, surrendered), the right approach (Spirit-led, cutting straight), and sound principles (Scripture interprets Scripture, context matters) to handle God's Word accurately.
- **Reiterate Central Verse (2 Tim 2:15):** Emphasize the goal – approval before God, effectiveness in His service, unashamed confidence in the truth.
- **Final Encouragement:** Embrace the journey of discovery in God's Word. It's a lifelong process, guided by His Spirit, leading to truth and eternal life.
- **Closing Prayer:** Pray for diligence, wisdom, and obedience in studying and applying God's Word.
