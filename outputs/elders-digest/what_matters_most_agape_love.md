### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** We often focus on abilities, knowledge, or grand gestures in
  spiritual life. But what does God value most? **(RQ)**
- Introduce the concept of _Agape_ love â€“ divine, selfless love.
- State Central Verse: 1 Corinthians 13:13. The ultimate measure.
- **Goal:** To understand from Scripture why Agape love is supreme and what it
  looks like practically.
- [Write on board: AGAPE LOVE (1 Cor 13)]

### Section 1: Love vs. Everything Else (1 Cor 13:1-3) (10 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Are spiritual gifts or great sacrifices the pinnacle of
  Christian experience? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (1 Cor 13:1-3):** Paul contrasts Agape with highly valued
  spiritual manifestations and actions.
  - Tongues/Prophecy/Knowledge without love = noise, emptiness (v. 1-2).
    `[Note verse refs]`
  - Extreme sacrifice (giving all, martyrdom) without love = profits _nothing_
    (v. 3). `[Note verse ref]`
  - [Write on board: Gifts/Sacrifice - Love = NOTHING (1 Cor 13:1-3)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** We might excel in church roles or charitable acts,
  but _why_ are we doing them? What's the motive? **(RQ)** Is it genuine,
  God-given love?
- **Actionable Step:** Examine our motives this week. Ask God to reveal if love
  is the driving force behind our service and interactions. (Based on 1 Cor
  13:1-3 implication).

### Section 2: The Portrait of True Love (1 Cor 13:4-7) [*] (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** What does this essential Agape love actually _look_
  like in action? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle (1 Cor 13:4-7):** Paul paints a detailed picture through
  positive and negative descriptions.
  - **Positive Attributes:**
    - Patient (longsuffering), Kind (v. 4a). `[Note verse ref]`
    - Rejoices in truth (v. 6b). `[Note verse ref]`
    - Bears all things, Believes all things (best), Hopes all things, Endures
      all things (v. 7). `[Note verse ref]`
    - [Write on board: Love IS: Patient, Kind, Truthful, Bearing, Believing,
      Hoping, Enduring (1 Cor 13:4, 6-7)]
  - **Negative Attributes (What Love is NOT):**
    - Not envious, boastful, proud, arrogant (v. 4b). `[Note verse ref]`
    - Not rude (unseemly), self-seeking (v. 5a). `[Note verse ref]`
    - Not easily provoked (irritable), thinks no evil (keeps no record of
      wrongs) (v. 5b). `[Note verse ref]`
    - Rejoices not in iniquity (v. 6a). `[Note verse ref]`
    - [Write on board: Love is NOT: Envious, Boastful, Proud, Rude, Selfish,
      Irritable, Resentful (1 Cor 13:4-5)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** How does this list challenge our daily interactions
  at home, work, church? **(RQ)** Where do we fall short based on _these
  verses_?
  - [Analogy (from v. 4-7): Love as the framework holding relationships
    together, preventing collapse under stress.]
- **Actionable Steps (Choose 1-2 based on self-assessment):**
  1.  Practice patience when provoked this week (v. 4, 5). `[Link to verse]`
  2.  Actively look for the good in someone (believes all things - v. 7).
      `[Link to verse]`
  3.  Refuse to keep a mental list of wrongs done by others (thinks no evil - v.
      5). `[Link to verse]`

### Section 3: Love's Source, Endurance, and Testimony (1 Cor 13:8, 13; Rom 5:5; 1 John 4:8; John 13:35) (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Where does this kind of love come from? Is it just
  human effort? Will it last? **(RQ)**
- **Biblical Principle:**
  - **Permanence:** Love _never fails_ (1 Cor 13:8a). Gifts (prophecy, tongues,
    knowledge) are temporary, ceasing when the perfect comes (v. 8b-10).
    `[Note verse refs]`
    - [Write on board: Gifts = Temporary; Love = Eternal (1 Cor 13:8)]
  - **Supremacy:** Love is the _greatest_ of the abiding virtues: Faith, Hope,
    Love (1 Cor 13:13). `[Note verse ref]`
  - **Source:** Agape is not natural; it's divinely imparted. Poured into our
    hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5). `[Note verse ref]`
    - [Write on board: Source: Holy Spirit (Rom 5:5)]
  - **Essence of God:** God _is_ love (1 John 4:8). To know God is to know and
    experience His love. `[Note verse ref]`
    - [Aside: *"Understanding that 'God is love' isn't just a comforting phrase;
      it's the foundational truth of the universe. It explains creation,
      redemption, and the law itself. Everything flows from His character of
      selfless love."*]
  - **Ultimate Testimony:** Genuine love for one another is the primary evidence
    to the world that we are Christ's disciples (John 13:35). `[Note verse ref]`
    - [Write Question (from John 13:35): How effectively does *our* love testify
      to the world?] **(RQ)**
- **Bridging to Practice:** If love is from God, we must be connected to Him to
  express it. If it's our greatest testimony, how seriously do we cultivate it?
  - [Aside: *"Our church communities should be laboratories where Agape love is
    practiced and perfected through the Spirit. They are meant to be previews of
    heaven, demonstrating God's character to a world starved for genuine
    connection."*]
- **Actionable Step:** Pray daily for the Holy Spirit to fill you with God's
  love (Rom 5:5) and consciously look for opportunities to demonstrate it to
  fellow believers and the world (John 13:35).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
