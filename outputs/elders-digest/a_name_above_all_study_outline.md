### Introduction (5 min)

*   Significance of names in Scripture and life (identity, authority, character).
*   Introduce the ultimate name: JESUS. **(RQ)** What makes this name different?
*   Purpose: To explore *from Scripture* the identity, mission, and power vested in the name of Jesus.
*   Central Verse Read: Philippians 2:9-11. `[Whiteboard: A Name Above All Names - Phil 2:9]`

### Section 1: The Identity Behind the Name (10 min)

*   **The Need:** To understand *who* Jesus is to grasp the power of His name. **(RQ)** Was Jesus just a good man, a prophet, or more?
*   **Biblical Principle (John 1:1, 14):** Jesus is eternally God (the Word), who became fully human.
    *   John 1:1 - Pre-existence, Divinity. `[Whiteboard: John 1:1 - Word = God]`
    *   John 1:14 - Incarnation. `[Whiteboard: John 1:14 - Word -> Flesh]`
*   **Biblical Principle (Phil 2:5-8):** The humility and condescension of God becoming man.
    *   Equality with God (v. 6).
    *   Self-emptying, taking servant form (v. 7).
    *   Obedience unto death (v. 8). `[Whiteboard: Phil 2:6-8: God -> Man -> Servant -> Death]`
*   **Bridging to Practice:** His divine-human nature uniquely qualifies Him as Savior and Mediator. Understanding this fuels our faith and trust.
*   **Actionable Step:** Meditate on Philippians 2:5-8 this week, asking God to reveal the depth of Christ's humility. How can you reflect this attitude (v. 5)?

### Section 2: The Mission in the Name (12 min) [*]

*   **The Need:** Why did the eternal Son of God need to come to earth? What problem required such a drastic solution? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle (Matt 1:21):** The name 'Jesus' (Yeshua) means 'Yahweh saves'. His primary mission is salvation *from sin*.
    *   Not just saving from consequences, but the *root problem* of sin itself.
    *   `[Whiteboard: Matt 1:21 - JESUS = SAVES FROM SIN]`
*   **Biblical Principle (Isa 53:5; cf. Mark 10:45):** Salvation accomplished through His substitutionary sacrifice.
    *   Isa 53:5 - He bore *our* wounds, *our* transgressions, *our* iniquities. `[Whiteboard: Isa 53:5 - Wounded for OUR transgressions]`
    *   Mark 10:45 - Gave His life a *ransom* for many.
    *   `[Analogy (from Isa 53): Like a judge stepping down, taking the guilty party's sentence upon himself.]`
*   **Bridging to Practice:** His death wasn't accidental; it was the divinely appointed means to pay our debt and reconcile us to God.
*   **Actionable Step:** Read Isaiah 53 slowly this week, inserting your name where appropriate. Thank Jesus specifically for being your substitute.

### Section 3: The Access Through the Name (12 min)

*   **The Need:** Can this divine Savior truly understand my daily struggles and temptations? How do I personally connect with this salvation? **(RQ)**
*   **Biblical Principle (Heb 4:15-16):** Jesus fully identifies with our human experience.
    *   Tempted in all points like us, yet without sin (v. 15). `[Whiteboard: Heb 4:15 - Tempted like us -> Sinless -> Understands]`
    *   Therefore, He is a merciful and faithful High Priest.
    *   This grants us *bold access* to the throne of grace for help (v. 16). `[Whiteboard: Heb 4:16 -> Bold Access -> Grace & Mercy]`
*   **Biblical Principle (Acts 4:12; cf. John 14:6):** Jesus is the unique and sole Savior.
    *   Acts 4:12 - No other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. `[Whiteboard: Acts 4:12 - ONLY Name for Salvation]`
    *   John 14:6 - The *only* Way, Truth, Life to the Father.
*   **Bridging to Practice:** Because He understands us perfectly (Heb 4:15) and is the *only* way (Acts 4:12), His name is the key that unlocks salvation, forgiveness, peace, comfort, hope, and divine power.
    *   `[Aside: Like an ambassador carrying the full authority of his government, the name of Jesus carries all the authority of heaven. When we approach God in His name, we are leveraging that divine authority.]`
*   **Actionable Steps:** 
    1.  When facing temptation or need, consciously approach God *through the name of Jesus*, claiming the boldness Heb 4:16 promises.
    2.  Pray specifically in Jesus' name for temporal and spiritual needs, trusting God's provision through Him (cf. John 16:23-24).
    3.  Share the hope found *only* in Jesus with gentleness and respect (Acts 4:12).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

*   Recap: The name 'Jesus' represents...
    *   The Divine Identity: God with us (John 1:14).
    *   The Saving Mission: Deliverance from sin through His sacrifice (Matt 1:21; Isa 53:5).
    *   The Unique Access: Our sympathetic High Priest and the only way to God (Heb 4:15-16; Acts 4:12).
*   The name of Jesus isn't magic; its power lies in the Person and work it represents.
*   There is salvation, peace, comfort, hope, and power available *today* through faith in His name.
*   **Invitation:** Have you personally accepted the salvation offered in His name? **(RQ)** Will you trust Him fully, relying on His name not just for eternal life, but for strength and guidance each day?
*   Final thought: Let Philippians 2:10-11 be our reality now â€“ bowing our knees and confessing Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
