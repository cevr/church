### The Eight Principles of Health [*] (15 min)

- **Introduction:** God's simple, accessible methods for maintaining the
  'temple'.
- [Illustration: Like tending a garden, our bodies require consistent care

    glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
  - [Whiteboard: Body = God's Temple (1 Cor 6:19-20) -> Stewardship Duty]
  - [Illustration: Just as neglecting maintenance on a valuable instrument
    hinders its performance and ability to produce beautiful music, neglecting
    God's health laws hinders our physical and spiritual effectiveness. We are
    His instruments (1 Cor 6:19-20), meant to be kept in tune for His service.]
  - **(RQ)** How does knowing our body belongs to God impact our daily choices?
- **Temperance in Practice:**

    just alcohol, encompassing moderation in diet, work, study, and even healthy
    things, reflecting the balance seen in 1 Cor 9:25.]
  - **(RQ)** What common practices today challenge biblical temperance?
- **The Indispensable Role of Trust:**
