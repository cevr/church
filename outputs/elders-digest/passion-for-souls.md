### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: What truly moves your heart? What evokes deep compassion?
- Introduce Theme: Cultivating Christ's 'Passion for Souls'.
- Central Verse: Matthew 9:36 - Jesus' view of the lost.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 9:36 - Compassion for the Lost]`
- Overview: We will explore:
  1.  The reality of the lost condition (Why compassion is needed).
  2.  Embracing Christ's perspective (Seeing as He sees).
  3.  Our God-given responsibility (How we respond).

### Section 1: The Lost Condition (10 min)

- **Christ's Observation (Matt 9:36):**
  - "Fainted" (weary, harassed) and "scattered" (dispersed, vulnerable).
  - "As sheep having no shepherd" - Directionless, unprotected, prey to danger.
  - `[Whiteboard: Lost = Fainted, Scattered, No Shepherd (Matt 9:36)]`
- **The Universal Reality:**
  - All have sinned (Rom 3:23) - Separation from God is the default state.
  - Without Christ = Without Hope (Eph 2:12) - Strangers to God's promises,
    alienated.
  - What are they missing? Peace with God (Rom 5:1), True Hope (1 Pet 1:3),
    Divine Guidance (Prov 3:6), Eternal Life (John 3:16).
  - `[Whiteboard: Missing: Peace, Hope, Guidance, Eternal Life (Eph 2:12, Rom 5:1)]`
- **The Seriousness:** It's not just missing blessings, but facing eternal
  separation (2 Thess 1:8-9).
- Do we truly grasp the desperate state of those without Christ? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: Christ's Compassion & Our Vision [*] (10 min)

- **God's Heart:**
  - He desires _none_ to perish (2 Peter 3:9).
  - He _loved_ the world enough to send His Son (John 3:16).
  - `[Whiteboard: God's Desire = ALL Saved (2 Pet 3:9, John 3:16)]`
- **Christ's Compassion (Matt 9:36):**
  - "Moved with compassion" - A deep, visceral response leading to action.
  - It wasn't mere pity; it was empathy driving Him to seek and save (Luke
    19:10).
- **Our Need for His Vision:**
  - We must ask God to help us see people as He does – not as interruptions or
    statistics, but as precious souls He died for.
  - How does seeing the 'harvest potential' change our view of difficult people?
    **(RQ)**
  - `[Analogy (from Matt 9:36): Like a shepherd seeing his vulnerable sheep scattered by predators – immediate concern and action.]`
- `[Aside: "Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture."]`

### Section 3: Our Three-Fold Responsibility (15 min)

- **Transition:** Seeing the need and feeling Christ's compassion leads to
  responsibility (Matt 9:37-38).
- **1. Visualize the Harvest (Matt 9:37):**
  - "The harvest truly is plenteous..." - Recognize the vast number of souls
    ready, needing labourers.
  - See the potential, not just the problems. Look beyond appearances.
  - `[Whiteboard: 1. VISUALIZE Harvest (Matt 9:37) - See the Potential]`
  - Where is the 'plenteous harvest' in our community, our workplace, our
    family? **(RQ)**
- **2. Agonize in Prayer (Matt 9:38):**
  - "Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth
    labourers..." - Prayer is foundational.
  - Pray for the lost by name. Pray for workers. Pray for open doors (Col 4:3).
  - `[Whiteboard: 2. AGONIZE in Prayer (Matt 9:38) - Pray for Lost & Laborers]`
  - This isn't passive wishing; it's earnest intercession.
- **3. Evangelize - Be a Laborer (Matt 9:38b; 2 Tim 4:5):**
  - Prayer leads to action: "send forth labourers" implies _being willing to be
    sent_ or to _support_ those who go.
  - "Do the work of an evangelist" (2 Tim 4:5) - This applies to _all_
    believers, not just pastors/evangelists.
  - `[Whiteboard: 3. EVANGELIZE (2 Tim 4:5) - Be/Support Laborers]`
  - Fulfilling the Great Commission (Matt 28:19-20) is our mandate.
- **Personal Obligation & Motivation:**
  - The Church is God's agency; the obligation rests on _all_ Christians (EGW,
    SC 81). `[Quote Concept: SC 81 - Church is agency, obligation on all]`
  - Use God-given talents/opportunities (Parable of Talents - Matt 25:14-30).
  - Love for Christ compels us (2 Cor 5:14; EGW, SC 81).
    `[Quote Concept: SC 81 - Love compels witness]`
  - Soul-winning contributes to our _own_ spiritual growth and assurance (EGW,
    SC 80). `[Quote Concept: SC 80 - Aids own salvation]`
- `[Aside: "Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed."]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Urgency:**
  - "Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to
    harvest" (John 4:35).
  - Time is short. The opportunity may pass.
  - `[Whiteboard: URGENCY! Harvest is NOW (John 4:35)]`
- **Recap:** We are called to SEE the lost (Visualize), PRAY for them (Agonize),
  and GO to them (Evangelize).
- **Challenge:** What is _one specific step_ you can take _this week_ to
  cultivate a passion for souls and act upon it, based on these scriptures?
  **(RQ)**
  - Pray for one lost person daily?
  - Share a testimony or resource?
  - Invite someone to church/study?
  - `[Whiteboard: Your Next Step? Pray? Share? Invite?]`
- **Final Appeal:** Let's ask God for His heart, His compassion. Commit to being
  a labourer in His harvest field, starting today.
- Closing Thought: The joy set before Christ (Heb 12:2) included seeing souls
  saved. We share in that joy as we participate.
