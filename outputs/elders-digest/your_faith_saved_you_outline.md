### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a question: What does it _really_ mean when Jesus says,
  "Your faith has saved you"? Is it just believing something exists?
- **Context:** Briefly introduce the scene - Jesus surrounded by a pressing
  crowd (Mark 5:24).
- **Introduce the Woman:** A desperate case, seemingly hopeless.
- **Central Question:** This story reveals the nature of _saving_ faith. What is
  it? How does it work? **(RQ)**
- [Write on board: Mark 5:24-34 - Saving Faith]

### Section 1: The Problem No One Could Solve (8 min)

- **Read/Summarize:** Mark 5:25-26 - Twelve years of suffering, depleted
  resources, physicians failed, condition worsened.
  - Emphasize the _hopelessness_ from a human perspective.
  - [Whiteboard: Obstacles: 1. Chronic Illness (12 yrs), 2. Financial Ruin, 3.
    Medical Failure, 4. Social Isolation (implied - unclean)]
- **The Need:** Illustrates our condition before Christ – helpless against sin,
  resources fail, human solutions inadequate (cf. Romans 7:24).
- **Relatability:** How often do we face situations where human help fails?
  Financial stress? Health issues? Relational breakdowns? **(RQ)**
- **Connecting Point:** Her desperation drove her _towards_ the only remaining
  hope.

### Section 2: The Touch of Desperate Faith (12 min)

- **Read/Summarize:** Mark 5:27-29 - She _heard_ of Jesus, she _came_ in the
  press behind, she _touched_ His garment, believing "If I may touch but his
  clothes, I shall be whole."
  - **Faith Source:** She _heard_ (Romans 10:17 - Faith comes by hearing the
    Word).
  - **Active Faith:** Not passive wishing. She _acted_ despite obstacles (crowd,
    weakness, uncleanness).
    - [Whiteboard: Action Steps of Faith (Mark 5:27): Heard -> Came -> Touched
      -> Believed]
  - **Specific Belief:** Focused on Christ's power, even indirect contact. She
    believed _He_ was the solution.
  - **Immediate Result:** Felt in her body she was healed (Mark 5:29). Divine
    power responds to faith's touch.
- **Theological Insight (DA 343, 347):** This wasn't mere superstition. It was
  personal trust directed at Christ Himself, believing His power could flow even
  through His garment. It was a _personal transaction_ – reaching out to take
  what He offered.
  - [Analogy (from Mark 5:27-29): Like plugging a device into a power source.
    The power is there, but connection requires an action based on belief it
    will work.]
- **RQ:** What obstacles (fear, doubt, crowds of opinion) keep us from 'pressing
  through' to touch Christ today? **(RQ)**

### Section 3: The Power and Pronouncement [*] (10 min)

- **Read/Summarize:** Mark 5:30-33 - Jesus _knew_ power had gone out. He asks,
  "Who touched my clothes?" Disciples are confused (many touching). Woman comes
  trembling, tells all.
  - **Divine Awareness:** Christ is aware of the faintest touch of genuine
    faith, distinct from the casual contact of the crowd.
    - [Whiteboard: Crowd's Touch (Curiosity/Accident) vs. Faith's Touch
      (Intentional/Believing - Mark 5:30)]
  - **Public Confession:** Jesus draws her out, not for condemnation, but for
    confirmation and teaching.
- **Read:** Mark 5:34 - "Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace,
  and be whole of thy plague."
  - **Confirmation:** He affirms the healing.
  - **Attribution:** He attributes it to _her faith_ – the conduit through which
    His power flowed.
  - **Peace & Wholeness:** Faith brings not just physical restoration (in this
    case) but peace with God.
- **Insight (DA 347):** "It is not faith that saves us, but Christ... Faith is
  the hand by which we grasp the divine supply." Saving faith embraces Christ
  and His merits.
- [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our lives, touched by faith, should
  represent the kingdom of heaven, demonstrating its power and peace even amidst
  the 'crowds' of this world.]

### Section 4: What _Is_ Saving Faith? (5 min)

- **Synthesize:** Based on the story and supporting texts:
  - **Not just belief _about_ God:** (James 2:19 - demons believe). It's trust
    _in_ God.
  - **Active, not passive:** Requires reaching out, acting on belief (Mark 5:27;
    James 2:17-20).
  - **Personal Transaction:** Laying hold of Christ and His promises for oneself
    (DA 347).
  - **Persistent:** Overcomes obstacles (Mark 5:27).
  - **Life-Transforming:** Brings divine power, healing, peace (Mark 5:34; DA
    347 - vigor, conquering power).
  - **Grounded in God's Word:** Comes by hearing (Rom 10:17).
  - **Essential:** Without it, impossible to please God (Heb 11:6).
- [Whiteboard: Saving Faith = Active Trust + Personal Reception of Christ +
  Reliance on His Power (Mark 5:34, Heb 11:6, DA 347)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** The woman's story shows saving faith isn't complicated theory, but
  simple, desperate, active trust in Jesus as the _only_ solution.
- **Challenge:** Are we just part of the 'crowd' bumping against Jesus with
  casual interest, or are we reaching out with the touch of personal, desperate
  faith for our needs (forgiveness, strength, victory over sin)? **(RQ)**
- **Practical Application (MS 22, 1889):** God provides strength for _present_
  needs. We must exercise faith _today_ for _today's_ challenges, trusting Him
  moment by moment.
  - [Action Step (from Mark 5:27): Identify one area of 'need' this week.
    Consciously 'press through' obstacles (doubt, fear) in prayer, reaching out
    to claim Christ's power/promise for that specific situation.]
- **Final Appeal:** Jesus is still asking, "Who touched Me?" He feels the touch
  of faith. Reach out to Him now. Don't let anything hold you back. Accept His
  wholeness and peace.
- [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom... Just as the woman used the
  'press' of the crowd to reach Jesus, we can navigate the pressures of life not
  as hindrances, but as the very path through which we press closer to Him for
  His power.]
- **Prayer:** Closing prayer focusing on exercising active, personal faith.
