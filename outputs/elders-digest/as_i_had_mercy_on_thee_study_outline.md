### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Introduce the Beatitude: Matthew 5:7 - A promise linked to a condition.
- What is Mercy?
  - More than just pity; active compassion, forgiveness, withholding deserved
    judgment.
  - `[Write on board: Mercy = Compassion + Forgiveness + Kindness]`
- The Core Principle: Receiving God's mercy is intrinsically linked to showing
  mercy to others. (Matt 5:7)
- **(RQ)** Why might Jesus place such emphasis on this particular quality right
  near the start of His sermon?

### Section 1: The Source and Standard of Mercy (8 min)

- **God is Merciful:** His essential nature.
  - Exodus 34:6-7 - God proclaims His name: merciful, gracious, longsuffering.
  - `[Whiteboard: God's Character = MERCIFUL (Ex 34:6)]`
  - Luke 6:36 - Our standard: "Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is
    merciful."
- **Christ Demonstrated Mercy:**
  - His entire life: Healing, teaching, forgiving.
  - Ultimate example: Luke 23:34b - "Father, forgive them; for they know not
    what they do."
  - His command reflects His actions: Matthew 10:8b - "freely ye have received,
    freely give."
  - `[Whiteboard: Christ's Mercy = Forgiveness (Lk 23:34), Generosity (Mt 10:8)]`
- Our capacity for mercy flows _from_ receiving His mercy (Eph 2:4-5).
  - **(RQ)** How does remembering God's mercy towards us fuel our mercy towards
    others?

### Section 2: The Unbreakable Law of Mercy [*] (9 min)

- **The Condition Explained:** Matthew 5:7 - "_for_ they shall obtain mercy."
  - Not earning salvation, but a principle of the kingdom.
  - James 2:13 - "For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
    mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment."
  - **Illustration:** Like looking in a mirror (James 1:23-24). If the mirror of
    God's law shows us needing mercy (which it does), but we refuse to show
    mercy, we are like the person who sees their face and immediately forgets
    what they look like â€“ ignoring the reality of our own need and God's
    provision (cf. James 2:13).
- **The Parable of the Unforgiving Servant:** Matthew 18:21-35
  - Huge debt forgiven (God's mercy to us). (Matt 18:27)
  - Small debt demanded mercilessly (Our lack of mercy). (Matt 18:28-30)
  - The consequence: Matthew 18:33-35 - Forgiveness revoked based on the
    servant's merciless actions.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 18:33 -> God's Mercy Received vs. Mercy Shown]`
  - `[Draw simple diagram: Receive Mercy -> Blocked by Unforgiveness -> Lose Mercy]`
- **A 'Self-Acting Law':**
  - Our attitude towards others reflects our true relationship with God's grace.
    (Matt 18:35)
  - An unforgiving heart cannot truly receive or appreciate God's forgiveness.
    (cf. Mark 11:25-26)
  - **(RQ)** In what ways might we act like the unforgiving servant without
    realizing it?
- `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies...]` Our interactions demonstrate the nature
  of the kingdom we represent. Showing mercy reflects the King's character,
  while harshness misrepresents Him.

### Section 3: Mercy in Action: Christ's Example (10 min)

- **What does being 'merciful' look like practically?** (Based on Christ &
  Scripture)
  - **Kindness & Tenderheartedness:** Ephesians 4:32a - Active goodwill,
    gentleness in spirit.
  - **Forgiveness:** Ephesians 4:32b - Releasing wrongs "even as God for
    Christ's sake hath forgiven you." This is the _motivation_ and _measure_.
    - `[Write on board: Forgive AS God Forgave You (Eph 4:32)]`
  - **Compassion for the Needy:** Matthew 25:34-40 - Mercy shown through
    practical help (food, drink, clothing, visitation).
    - Seeing Christ in the "least of these." (Matt 25:40)
    - **(RQ)** How does serving the needy connect directly to being merciful
      according to Jesus?
  - **Withholding Harsh Judgment:** Luke 6:37a - "Judge not... condemn not..."
    - Not ignoring sin, but refusing a critical, condemning spirit. Focus on
      restoration, not just condemnation (Gal 6:1).
    - `[Whiteboard: Mercy = Judge Fairly, Not Harshly (Lk 6:37)]`
  - **Illustration:** Showing mercy is like being a conduit for God's grace. God
    pours His mercy into us (Eph 2:4-5); being merciful means letting that grace
    flow _through_ us to others (Eph 4:32), rather than damming it up with
    unforgiveness or indifference.

### Section 4: Applying Mercy Today (7 min)

- **Need/Question (from text):** We see the standard (Luke 6:36) and the
  consequence of failing (Matt 18:35, James 2:13). The need is clear: How do we
  cultivate a merciful heart in a world often characterized by judgment and
  harshness? How do we avoid being the unforgiving servant?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** Our ability and command to be merciful
  stem directly from receiving God's mercy through Christ (Eph 4:32). It's a
  reflection of His character (Luke 6:36) and evidence of His grace working in
  us.
- **Bridging (from text):** This isn't just about ancient parables.
  - How do we react to annoying colleagues? (Eph 4:32 - kindness?)
  - How do we respond to family members who hurt us? (Eph 4:32 - forgiveness?)
  - How do we view those struggling or different from us? (Matt 25:40 -
    compassion?)
  - How do we engage in online discussions or react to news? (Luke 6:37 -
    withholding condemnation?)
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  1.  **Pray for a Merciful Spirit:** Ask God to help you see others as He sees
      them and to give you His heart of compassion (cf. Phil 2:5, Luke 6:36).
  2.  **Practice Active Forgiveness:** Identify one specific person or situation
      where you need to extend forgiveness, as God has forgiven you (Eph 4:32).
      Make a conscious choice to release the debt.
  3.  **Choose Compassion over Condemnation:** Find one opportunity this week to
      show practical kindness (Matt 25:40) or consciously withhold a harsh
      judgment (Luke 6:37), replacing it with understanding or prayer.
- **Invitation:** God freely offers us boundless mercy. Will we accept it fully
  by allowing it to transform how we treat others? Let us choose today to be
  conduits of His mercy, reflecting His love to the world.

### Conclusion (6 min)

- Recap: Mercy is God's nature (Ex 34:6), our standard (Luke 6:36), demonstrated
  by Christ (Luke 23:34), and required of His followers (Matt 5:7).
- The Promise and the Principle: "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall
  obtain mercy." (Matt 5:7). This isn't earning salvation, but living out the
  reality of the grace we've received. Our mercy to others is the fruit of God's
  mercy to us.
- Final Thought: Reflecting God's mercy is not optional; it's central to
  Christian character and our witness. It proves the reality of His transforming
  grace in our lives (cf. James 2:13).
- **(RQ)** What is one step you will take this week to be more intentionally
  merciful, reflecting the mercy God has shown you?
- Call to Prayer / Closing Prayer (focusing on receiving and extending God's
  mercy).
- Announce Closing Hymn.
