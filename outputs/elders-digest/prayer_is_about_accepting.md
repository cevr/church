### Introduction (5 min)

- Prayer: Often viewed as asking (Matt 7:7), but Christ's model prayer begins
  with relationship, a fundamental _acceptance_ of WHO God is: "Our Father"
  (Matt 6:9).
- This relational starting point transforms prayer from a transaction to
  communion. (John 17:3)
- **(RQ)** How does acknowledging God _first_ as "Father" change the _way_ we
  ask and what we ask for? (cf. Matt 6:8 - "Your Father knoweth what things ye
  have need of, before ye ask him.")
- Today's focus: Grounding our prayer life in the scriptural acceptances
  required to truly call God "Father."
- [Write on board: Prayer = Accepting: 1. God as Father (Matt 6:9) 2. His
  Reality & Promises (Heb 11:6; Matt 6:33) 3. His Way of Approach (1 Tim 2:5;
  James 1:6)]

### Section 1: Understanding 'Our Father' Through New Birth (10 min)

- **A. He _Becomes_ Our Father Spiritually:**
  - This relationship isn't automatic by creation alone, but requires spiritual
    rebirth. (John 1:12 - "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to
    become the sons of God...")
  - Jesus emphasized this necessity: "Except a man be born again, he cannot see
    the kingdom of God." (John 3:3) "Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must
    be born again." (John 3:7)
  - [Write on board: John 3:3 -> New Birth -> Child of God]
  - This new birth grants us the "Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
    Father." (Romans 8:15)
  - It's a deliberate act of God's will and love: "Having predestinated us unto
    the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself..." (Ephesians 1:5; see
    also Gal 4:5-7)
- **B. Reflecting the Father's Character:**
  - Being His children means reflecting His character of love and obedience. (1
    John 3:1-2 - "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon
    us...")
  - **(RQ)** If God is our Father, what does that imply about our relationship
    with fellow believers, who are also His children? (cf. Mal 2:10 - "Have we
    not all one father?")
  - [Aside: Ellen White notes, "Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to
    a friend." (Steps to Christ, p. 93). This friendship is rooted in the
    Father-child relationship established through Christ.]

### Section 2: Accepting God's Reality & Promises (12 min) [*]

- **A. Foundational Belief: He IS:**
  - Meaningful prayer requires accepting God's existence and His active
    involvement. "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
    cometh to God must believe that he is..." (Hebrews 11:6a)
  - This isn't just intellectual assent, but a deep conviction in His presence
    and power. (Jer 23:24 - "Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall
    not see him? saith the LORD...")
  - [Write on board: Hebrews 11:6a -> Must Believe: 1. He IS 2. He REWARDS]
- **B. Foundational Belief: He REWARDS:**
  - We must also believe "...and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently
    seek him." (Hebrews 11:6b)
  - This reward isn't always material, but includes His presence, peace,
    guidance, and ultimately, eternal life. (John 17:3)
- **C. Accepting His Promise of Provision:**
  - As a loving Father, He knows and provides for our needs. Jesus explicitly
    commands us _not_ to worry like the Gentiles do. (Matthew 6:31-32)
  - The condition: Seek _first_ His Kingdom and righteousness. (Matthew 6:33a)
  - The promise: "...and all these things shall be added unto you." (Matthew
    6:33b)
  - **(RQ)** How does prioritizing God's kingdom (His rule, His ways)
    demonstrate our trust in Him as Father?
  - _Illustration:_ Like a child trusts a loving parent for daily food and
    shelter, we are called to trust our Heavenly Father for our temporal _and_
    spiritual needs when we align with His priorities. Worry demonstrates a lack
    of faith in the Father's care.

### Section 3: How We Approach Our Father in Faith (12 min)

- **A. Through the One Mediator:**
  - We don't approach the Father based on our own merit. Access is granted
    _only_ through Jesus Christ. "For there is one God, and one mediator between
    God and men, the man Christ Jesus;" (1 Timothy 2:5)
  - Jesus Himself confirmed this: "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
    cometh unto the Father, but by me." (John 14:6)
  - [Write on board: Our Approach -> FATHER <- via JESUS (1 Tim 2:5)]
  - Our prayers are offered _in Jesus' name_, acknowledging His sacrifice and
    authority. (John 16:23-24)
- **B. With Unwavering Faith:**
  - Approaching God requires faith, not doubt. "But let him ask in faith,
    nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with
    the wind and tossed." (James 1:6)
  - **(RQ)** What practical things can help us combat doubt when we pray,
    anchoring our faith in God's character and promises (like Matt 6:33)?
  - Faith isn't wishing; it's trusting God's revealed will and character, even
    when we don't see the immediate answer. (Heb 11:1)
  - [Aside: The pioneers often spoke of "prevailing prayer" â€“ persistent,
    faith-filled prayer based on God's promises, wrestling like Jacob until the
    blessing came (Gen 32:26), but always submitting to God's ultimate will.]
- **C. Hallowing His Name:**
  - Our approach begins with reverence, acknowledging His holiness: "Hallowed be
    thy name." (Matthew 6:9b)
  - This means respecting His character, His authority, and His commands in our
    lives, not just our words. (cf. Isa 29:13)

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Need/Question (from text):** Do we truly approach God in prayer as our
  loving, providing Father (Matt 6:9, 33), having accepted the new birth He
  offers (John 3:3)? Do we come through the designated Mediator, Jesus (1 Tim
  2:5), and with unwavering faith (James 1:6)?
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** Meaningful prayer is built on accepting
  God as our Father through the new birth in Christ (John 3:3, Rom 8:15),
  trusting His existence and promises (Heb 11:6, Matt 6:33), and approaching Him
  solely through Jesus with unwavering faith (1 Tim 2:5, James 1:6).
- **Bridging (from text):** In our busy, often anxious lives, the command to
  seek _first_ the Kingdom (Matt 6:33) and trust our Father feels radical. Yet,
  this is the path to true peace and answered prayer according to Christ.
  Viewing prayer through this lens of _acceptance_ shifts it from a duty to a
  privilege of communion with our Father.
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  **Reflect:** This week, consciously begin prayers by acknowledging "Our
      Father" (Matt 6:9), reflecting on what that relationship means through
      Christ (Rom 8:15).
  2.  **Trust:** When tempted to worry about needs, recall Matthew 6:33.
      Verbally declare your trust in the Father's provision as you seek His
      kingdom first.
  3.  **Believe:** Before asking, reaffirm your belief that God IS and REWARDS
      those who seek Him (Heb 11:6). Pray specifically against doubt (cf. Mark
      9:24).
- **Invitation:** If you haven't accepted Jesus and the new birth He offers, you
  cannot truly call God "Father" in this intimate, saving sense. Today, accept
  His offer of adoption (John 1:12). If you are His child, recommit to
  approaching Him with the full acceptance and faith He deserves. Let us pray,
  accepting Him now.
