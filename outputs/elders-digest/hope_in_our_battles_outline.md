### Introduction (5 min)
-   Welcome & Prayer
-   Introduce Topic: Life involves battles (spiritual, emotional, physical). Where do we find unwavering hope?
-   Personal faith & relationship with God = The essential foundation. **(RQ)** How does knowing *who* God is change how we face struggles?
-   Introduce Central Verse: Psalm 27:1 - David's declaration of confidence.
-   Outline Overview: Exploring Psalm 27 to understand God as our Light, Salvation, Strength, Refuge, and Victory.

### Section 1: The Foundation of Hope (Psalm 27:1) (9 min)
-   **Read Psalm 27:1**
-   **God is our Light:**
    -   Meaning: Dispels darkness (sin, ignorance, despair - John 8:12), guides our path (Ps 119:105). `[Whiteboard: LIGHT = Guidance, Truth, Hope (Ps 27:1)]`
    -   **(RQ)** How does focusing on God as Light change our perspective in confusing times?
-   **God is our Salvation:**
    -   Meaning: Delivers from eternal damnation (John 3:16), secures our souls *now* (Eph 2:8), rescues from present dangers (Ps 18:2). `[Whiteboard: SALVATION = Rescue (Soul & Situation) (Ps 27:1)]`
    -   **(RQ)** Do we live with the assurance that our ultimate salvation is secure in Christ, regardless of current battles?
-   **God is our Strength:**
    -   Meaning: Our defense, stronghold, power to endure and overcome (Phil 4:13). Delivers from defeat, guarantees ultimate success in His will (Isa 40:29-31). `[Whiteboard: STRENGTH = Defense, Power, Endurance (Ps 27:1)]`
    -   **(RQ)** Where do we naturally turn for strength first – ourselves, others, or God?
-   **Result:** Fearlessness rooted in God's character, not absence of problems. `[Write: God > Fear]`

### Section 2: Confidence in the Unchanging God [*] (6 min)
-   **(RQ)** Why could David be so confident? Because God is reliable.
-   **God's Past Performance:** David recalled past deliverances (e.g., from the lion, the bear, Goliath - **1 Samuel 17:34-37**).
    -   We build confidence by remembering God's faithfulness in our own lives and in Scripture (Ps 77:11). `[Prompt: Share brief personal testimony/biblical example of God's past faithfulness]`
-   **God's Unchanging Nature:**
    -   Malachi 3:6 - "For I am the Lord, I change not..."
    -   Hebrews 13:8 - "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever."
    -   `[Whiteboard: God's Character = UNCHANGING (Mal 3:6, Heb 13:8)]`
    -   The God who helped David, Moses, Paul is *our* God today.
-   **Application:** Trust His character even when circumstances seem bleak. His nature guarantees His promises (Num 23:19).

### Section 3: Commitment: Seeking God's Presence (Psalm 27:4) (9 min)
-   **Read Psalm 27:4** - "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after..."
-   David's singular focus amidst turmoil wasn't just deliverance, but God Himself.
-   **Desiring His Presence:** "That I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life..."
    -   Not just heaven later, but constant communion *now* (John 15:4). `[Whiteboard: DWELL = Constant Communion]`
    -   **(RQ)** What does it practically mean to 'dwell' with God daily? (Prayer, Word, Obedience)
-   **Beholding His Beauty:** "...to behold the beauty of the Lord..."
    -   Focusing on God's character, His loveliness, His ways (Worship - Ps 96:9). `[Whiteboard: BEHOLD = Focus on God's Character (Worship)]`
    -   [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our lives, when focused on God's beauty, become outposts reflecting His kingdom's values, not the world's, even amidst battles.]
-   **Depending on Him:** "...and to inquire in his temple."
    -   Seeking His guidance, wisdom, will in every situation (Prov 3:5-6). `[Whiteboard: INQUIRE = Seek His Will/Guidance]`
    -   **(RQ)** Is seeking God's specific guidance our first step or last resort in trouble?
-   **Application:** Prioritize relationship with God above the desire for mere problem-solving. Seeking Him *is* the path to peace and victory (Matt 6:33).

### Section 4: God's Secure Protection (Psalm 27:5; Col 3:3) (6 min)
-   **Read Psalm 27:5** - "For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion..."
-   God provides divine security amidst life's storms.
-   **Imagery of Safety (from Ps 27:5):**
    -   `Pavilion`: Royal tent, place of protection and privacy. `[Whiteboard: PAVILION = Divine Shelter]`
    -   `Secret of His Tabernacle`: Innermost sanctuary, place of communion and safety. `[Whiteboard: TABERNACLE = Intimate Safety]`
    -   `Rock`: Stability, unshakeable foundation. `[Whiteboard: ROCK = Unshakeable Security]`
-   **Spiritual Reality:** Colossians 3:3 - "For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
    -   Our true identity and security are found *in Christ*, beyond the reach of earthly troubles' ultimate harm.
    -   **(RQ)** How does knowing our life is 'hid with Christ' impact our response to threats or losses? (Focus shifts from temporal to eternal security).
-   **Application:** Find refuge *in God's presence* through prayer, study, trust (Prov 18:10). He is our true safe place.

### Section 5: Victory and Worship (Psalm 27:6) (5 min)
-   **Read Psalm 27:6** - "And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me..."
-   Confidence in God leads to assurance of eventual victory.
-   **Elevation Over Enemies:** Not necessarily removal *of* enemies, but being lifted *above* their influence and power by God's perspective and strength.
    -   God grants perspective and spiritual ascendancy (cf. Rom 8:37 - more than conquerors).
-   **Result: Worship & Praise:** "...therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord."
    -   Victory leads to grateful worship. We praise Him *because* He is our Light, Salvation, Strength, Refuge (Ps 27:1, 5).
    -   [Brief Illustration Concept: Like reaching a mountain summit - the struggle is forgotten in the glorious view and sense of accomplishment *given by God*.]
-   **Application:** Even amidst the battle, begin to praise God for the promised victory in Christ (1 Cor 15:57).

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)
-   Recap: Hope isn't wishful thinking; it's confidence based on *Who God is* (Light, Salvation, Strength - Ps 27:1) and His *unchanging nature* (Mal 3:6).
-   This hope is accessed through *relationship* (dwelling, beholding, inquiring - Ps 27:4) and results in *security* (Ps 27:5; Col 3:3) and *victory* (Ps 27:6).
-   **(RQ)** Are you facing battles today? Where is your focus fixed? On the storm or the Rock?
-   **Invitation:**
    -   Choose today to make God your singular desire (Ps 27:4).
    -   Actively trust Him as your Light, Salvation, and Strength (Ps 27:1).
    -   Find your security in being 'hid with Christ' (Col 3:3).
    -   Commit to 'inquiring' - seeking His guidance first (Prov 3:6).
-   Final Prayer: For attendees to experience the unwavering hope found only in God amidst their personal battles, trusting His character and promises.
