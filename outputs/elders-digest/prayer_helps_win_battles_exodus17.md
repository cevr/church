### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: We are all involved in unseen spiritual battles daily (Eph 6:12).
- Briefly introduce the setting: Israel, newly freed, faces an unprovoked attack
  by Amalek (Ex 17:8).
- Purpose: To explore Exodus 17 as a powerful illustration of how vital prayer
  is for spiritual victory, both personally and corporately.
- Central Verse Read: Exodus 17:11 - The core principle.
- [Whiteboard: SPIRITUAL BATTLE (Eph 6:12) -> PRAYER = VICTORY (Ex 17:11)]

### Main Content Section 1: The Battle and the Intercessor (12 min)

- **The Divine Strategy (Ex 17:8-9):**
  - Amalek attacks Israel – representing the constant opposition of the enemy.
  - Moses' instruction: Joshua fights, Moses prays on the hill with the 'rod of
    God'.
  - [Whiteboard: Joshua (Action/Fight - Valley) + Moses (Intercession/Authority
    - Hill)]
  - Point: Spiritual victory requires both active engagement ('fighting') and
    dedicated, authoritative prayer ('rod of God').
  - (RQ) What does holding the 'rod of God' symbolize in our prayers today?
    (Praying with faith in God's power and authority).
- **Prayer's Direct Impact (Ex 17:10-11):**
  - Moses obeys; the direct correlation is shown.
  - Hands Up (Prayer Ascending) -> Israel Prevails.
  - Hands Down (Prayer Ceasing) -> Amalek Prevails.
  - [Whiteboard: Draw arrows: Prayer UP -> Victory UP; Prayer DOWN -> Defeat UP]
  - Point: Intercessory prayer is not passive; it actively influences the
    outcome of spiritual conflicts. It sustains those on the front lines.
  - (RQ) Seeing this direct link in Ex 17:11, how might our prayerlessness be
    affecting unseen battles in our lives or church?
  - Evangelism Link: Success in outreach (Joshua fighting) depends on sustained
    prayer support (Moses on the hill).

### Main Content Section 2: Teamwork and Persistence in Prayer [*] (12 min)

- **The Struggle in Intercession (Ex 17:12a):**
  - Moses' hands became heavy – Intercession can be wearying.
  - Point: Acknowledges the reality of prayer fatigue. It's not always easy.
  - (RQ) Have you ever felt 'heavy hands' in your prayer life? What does this
    passage suggest?
- **The Necessity of Support (Ex 17:12b):**
  - Aaron and Hur come alongside, providing physical support to keep Moses'
    hands raised.
  - [Whiteboard: Moses + Aaron + Hur = Sustained Intercession]
  - Point: The vital importance of teamwork and mutual support in prayer. We
    need prayer partners and corporate prayer.
  - [Analogy (from Ex 17:12): Like paramedics supporting a vital sign, Aaron and
    Hur supported the 'vital sign' of prayer for Israel's victory.]
  - (RQ) Who are your 'Aaron and Hur'? How can you be an 'Aaron' or 'Hur' for
    someone else this week?
- **Persistence Until Victory (Ex 17:12c-13):**
  - Hands were steady _until the going down of the sun_. Joshua decisively
    defeated Amalek.
  - Scripture Link: 1 Thess 5:17 - "Pray without ceasing."
  - Point: Victory often requires persistent, unwavering prayer until the
    breakthrough comes. Don't give up prematurely.
  - [Aside: "Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical
    truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the
    kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Sustained
    prayer, like Moses' upheld hands, maintains that spiritual territory against
    encroachment."]
  - Character Link: This persistence builds endurance and unwavering faith,
    essential character traits for God's people, especially in the last days.

### Main Content Section 3: Remembering and Declaring God's Victory (10 min)

- **Memorializing God's Acts (Ex 17:14):**
  - God's command: "Write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the
    ears of Joshua..."
  - [Whiteboard: Write -> Remember -> Rehearse/Teach]
  - Point: We must intentionally remember, record, and share God's interventions
    and answered prayers to build faith for present and future generations.
  - (RQ) How can we better practice Ex 17:14 in our personal lives and church
    community?
  - Last Generation Link: Passing on testimonies of God's faithfulness
    strengthens the final generation for their unique challenges.
- **Declaring God's Lordship (Ex 17:15-16):**
  - Moses builds an altar: "Jehovah Nissi" – The Lord is my Banner.
  - [Whiteboard: JEHOVAH NISSI = The LORD is My Banner (Protection, Victory,
    Allegiance)]
  - Point: Prayer acknowledges God's sovereignty and places us under His banner
    of protection and authority. It's a declaration of allegiance and trust.
  - The 'rod of God' (v.9) and 'Jehovah Nissi' (v.15) connect prayer with
    recognizing and wielding God's authority over the enemy.
  - [Aside: "Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use seasons often focused
    on materialism to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love. It's like
    finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we
    can put it to work for God's kingdom under His banner, Jehovah Nissi. Prayer
    helps us discern how to advance His cause."]
  - Last Day Urgency: As spiritual warfare intensifies (Rev 12:17), consciously
    praying under 'Jehovah Nissi' becomes crucial for standing firm.
