### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Greeting & Opening Prayer**
-   **The Concept:** Religion, intended for connection with God, can become diseased. What does 'sick religion' look like according to Scripture? **(RQ)**
-   **Purpose:** To diagnose symptoms of spiritual sickness in worship using Scripture and rediscover God's remedy.
-   **Central Text Introduction:** Jesus' strong reaction to the temple's state reveals God's heart about worship. (Read Matthew 21:13)
    -   `[Write on board: Matthew 21:13 - House of Prayer vs. Den of Thieves]`
-   **Roadmap:** We'll examine symptoms (Isa 29, Mal 1, John 2), root causes (1 Tim 6, Rev 3), and the path back to health (Rev 3, Matt 21).

### Section 1: Symptoms - Lost Reverence & Purpose (12 min)

-   **Symptom 1: Formalism - Heartless Worship**
    -   Read Isaiah 29:13. What does God identify as the core problem? ("their heart is far from me") **(RQ)**
    -   `[Whiteboard: Symptom 1: FORMALISM (Isa 29:13) = Outward Show / Inward Distance]`
    -   Discuss: Going through religious motions (drawing near with mouth/lips) without genuine awe, love, or submission in the heart (Isa 29:13). It's worship learned "by the precept of men," not from a relationship with God.
    -   Connection: This contrasts sharply with God's desire for worship "in spirit and in truth" (John 4:24).
-   **Symptom 2: Contempt - Cheapening the Sacred**
    -   Read Malachi 1:6-8. How were the priests despising God's name and polluting His altar? (Offering blind, lame, sick animals - Mal 1:7-8) **(RQ)**
    -   `[Whiteboard: Symptom 2: CONTEMPT (Mal 1:6-8) = Offering God Leftovers / Devaluing Holiness]`
    -   Discuss: Offering God less than our best (time, attention, resources), treating holy things casually. This demonstrates a low view of God's worthiness (Mal 1:6 - "Where is mine honour?").
    -   True worship involves recognizing God's value and offering our best, not just what's convenient or leftover (Ref. David refusing to offer what cost him nothing - 2 Sam 24:24).
-   **The Sacred Space Violated**
    -   Read John 2:14-16 (First Temple Cleansing). What specific activities provoked Jesus' response? (Selling oxen, sheep, doves; money changers - John 2:14).
    -   `[Draw simple diagram: Temple Courts -> Intended for Gentile Prayer (Isa 56:7) -> Became Marketplace (John 2:14)]`
    -   Connect: How does prioritizing commerce/personal gain profane a space designated for God's purpose? (Jesus calls it making His Father's house a "house of merchandise" - John 2:16; later, a "den of thieves" - Matt 21:13).
    -   `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture.]`
    -   Discuss: Modern parallels – Does focus on programs/budgets overshadow prayer and spiritual connection? (Matt 21:13). Does the church feel more like a social club than a house dedicated to God? (John 2:16).

### Section 2: Root Cause - Worldliness & Self-Focus [*] (10 min)

-   **The Corrupting Influence: Love of the World**
    -   Read 1 Timothy 6:10. Why is the *love* of money identified as a root of *all kinds* of evil? (It causes some to covet, leading them to err from the faith and pierce themselves with sorrows - 1 Tim 6:10). **(RQ)**
    -   `[Whiteboard: Root Cause 1: LOVE OF MONEY (1 Tim 6:10) -> Pierces through / Errors from faith]`
    -   Discuss: Prioritizing material gain/security over God's kingdom diverts affections and loyalty, leading faith astray (1 Tim 6:10).
    -   Connect: This love manifested in the temple market through exploitation (implied in "den of thieves" - Matt 21:13) and prioritizing profit over the sacred purpose of the space (John 2:14-16).
-   **The Deception of Self-Sufficiency**
    -   Read Revelation 3:15-17 (Laodicea). What is the danger of being lukewarm? Why did they feel 'rich' but were actually 'poor'? (They were self-deceived, trusting their material wealth while spiritually destitute - Rev 3:17). **(RQ)**
    -   `[Whiteboard: Root Cause 2: LUKEWARMNESS (Rev 3:15-17) -> Self-Sufficient -> Spiritually Blind/Poor]`
    -   Discuss: Comfort and prosperity can lead to a false sense of needing nothing, even from God (Rev 3:17 - "I am rich... and have need of nothing"). This breeds spiritual complacency (lukewarmness - Rev 3:16).
    -   `[Analogy: Spiritual health check-up. Lukewarmness is like having a low-grade fever – not healthy, not dead, just ineffective and unaware of the true condition described in Rev 3:17.]`
    -   How does this self-focus ("I am rich") replace God-focus and mission-focus? (Their spiritual poverty - Rev 3:17 - shows they weren't focused on God or His work).

### Section 3: Consequences & The Cure (12 min)

-   **Consequence: Loss of Mission**
    -   When reverence for God fades (Mal 1:6-8) and self-interest grows (Matt 21:12-13, Rev 3:17), what happens to the outward focus of faith? **(RQ)**
    -   The temple courts, meant as a "house of prayer *for all nations*" (Mark 11:17, quoting Isa 56:7), became obstructed by commerce (John 2:14), hindering access for seeking Gentiles. Sick religion inevitably becomes inward-focused, neglecting God's mission.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Lost Reverence (Mal 1) -> Self-Focus (Matt 21, Rev 3) -> Lost Mission (Isa 56:7)]`
-   **The Cure: Rekindling Zeal & True Worship**
    -   **Christ's Example:** Jesus' actions were driven by zeal for God's house (Read John 2:17 - "The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up"). This zeal wasn't just emotion; it led to decisive action (John 2:15-16; Matt 21:12).
    -   **God's Prescription (Laodicea):**
        -   Acknowledge the true condition (Rev 3:17).
        -   Seek true spiritual riches from Christ (Read Rev 3:18 - "buy of me gold tried in the fire... white raiment... eyesalve"). This requires recognizing our need.
        -   Be zealous and repent (Read Rev 3:19). Lukewarmness must be replaced by fervent commitment.
    -   **Restoring Purpose:** Re-establish God's intended priority: making His house a "house of prayer" (Matt 21:13). This means prioritizing communion with God above other activities.
    -   **Offering Acceptable Worship:** The cure involves rejecting the "polluted" offerings (Mal 1:7-8) and instead offering God our best, reflecting His worthiness (Implied contrast in Malachi).

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** We've seen the symptoms of sick religion – formalism (Isa 29:13), contempt (Mal 1:6-8), and profaning the sacred (John 2:14-16; Matt 21:13). We identified root causes in worldliness (1 Tim 6:10) and self-sufficient lukewarmness (Rev 3:15-17). The consequence is often a loss of mission.
-   **The Remedy:** The cure lies in rekindling zeal for God (John 2:17), repenting of lukewarmness (Rev 3:19), seeking true spiritual riches from Christ (Rev 3:18), and restoring God's priorities, especially prayer (Matt 21:13).
-   **Actionable Steps (Choose 1-2 for personal focus):**
    1.  **Heart Check:** This week, consciously examine your heart during worship/devotions. Ask: Is my heart truly present, or am I just going through motions? (Ref. Isa 29:13).
    2.  **Prioritize Prayer:** Designate a specific time/place this week to be your personal "house of prayer," intentionally minimizing distractions. (Ref. Matt 21:13).
    3.  **Offer Your Best:** Identify one specific area (time, talent, attention) where you can intentionally give God your best, not leftovers, this week. (Ref. Mal 1:8).
    4.  **Seek True Riches:** Spend focused time pursuing spiritual "gold" (Bible study, prayer, service) instead of prioritizing only material or worldly goals. (Ref. Rev 3:18; 1 Tim 6:10).
-   **Invitation:** Jesus stands at the door and knocks (Rev 3:20). He invites us out of lukewarmness and into genuine, vibrant fellowship. Will we hear His voice, open the door, and allow Him to cleanse and restore our worship, individually and corporately? Let's commit to being zealous for His house and His honor.
-   **Connect to Closing Hymn:** As we prepare to sing "O Brother, Be Faithful," let's ask God for the strength to be faithful in our worship, zealous for His truth, and ready for His soon return.
