### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with the image of prominent religious symbols (e.g., Christ the Redeemer
  statue).
  - Impressive, globally recognized... but silent stone.
- Contrast: The world these symbols overlook is still filled with sin,
  suffering, need. (Rom 3:23)
- **The Need:** We need more than symbols; we need a living, active Savior.
  - **(RQ)** Do symbols sometimes substitute for genuine connection with the
    living God?
- Introduce theme: Exploring the reality and power of Christ's outstretched arms
  – past, present, and future.
  - `[Whiteboard: Title - The Living Christ: Beyond Symbols]`

### Section 1: Symbols vs. The Living Savior (8 min)

- **The Problem:** Relying on outward forms without inward reality.
  - Symbols (like Corcovado) point, but cannot save. (cf. 1 Cor 8:4 - idols are
    nothing).
  - The world's condition proves symbols aren't enough. **(RQ)** Where do people
    mistakenly place their trust?
- **The Reality:** We must look _beyond_ the visible, heavenward by faith. (Heb
  12:2)
  - `[Whiteboard: Symbol (Points) <---> Reality (Saves - Heb 12:2)]`
  - Jesus isn't a statue; He is alive, at God's right hand. (Acts 7:55-56)
- **The Invitation:** To engage with the _living_ Christ, not just concepts
  about Him.
  - He is actively calling, reaching. (Rev 3:20)

### Section 2: The Universal Reach of Calvary's Arms (10 min)

- **The Act:** Christ's death – arms outstretched on the cross.
  - Not a passive victim, but divine power in action. (John 10:18)
  - Symbolism: Reaching wide to embrace _all_ humanity.
    - `[Whiteboard: Cross Arms = Universal Invitation (John 12:32)]`
  - John 12:32 - "lifted up... will draw all men unto me."
    - **(RQ)** How does the _universality_ of Christ's sacrifice impact how we
      see others?
  - EGW Insight: "His arms were outstretched to embrace the world..." (Morning
    Watch 1963) - _Briefly mention_. Connects the physical posture to the
    spiritual intent.
- **The Scope:** Atonement sufficient for every person. (1 John 2:2)
  - `[Illustration Concept: A single lifeboat (Cross) large enough for everyone drowning (Sin), but each must choose to get in.]`
- **The Call:** Respond to His drawing power.

### Section 3: Strength in His Unfailing Arms [*] (10 min)

- **Human Weakness:** We tire, falter, need support.
  - Moses' arms grew heavy (Exodus 17:11-12). A picture of human limitation in
    spiritual warfare/service.
    - `[Whiteboard: Moses' Arms (Human Effort - Needs Support) vs. God's Arms (Divine Power - Unfailing)]`
  - Job 26:2 - "How hast thou helped him that is without power?"
  - **(RQ)** Where do we feel our 'arms' getting heavy in our Christian walk or
    service?
- **Divine Strength:** God's arm is _never_ weak or short.
  - Isaiah 59:1 - "Behold, the LORD'S hand is not shortened, that it cannot
    save..."
  - Psalm 89:13 - "Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand..."
  - `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies, our lives should represent the power of the kingdom we belong to, drawing strength not from ourselves, but from the King whose arms uphold the universe.]`
- **The Application:** Actively rely on His strength, not our own.
  - Philippians 4:13 - "I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth
    me."
  - Action Step: Identify one area of weakness; consciously ask for His strength
    _based on His promise_ (e.g., Isa 41:10).

### Section 4: Refuge in His Everlasting Arms (7 min)

- **Life's Crises:** Storms, fears, uncertainties are real.
  - **(RQ)** Where do people instinctively run when trouble hits?
- **God's Promise:** A secure refuge.
  - Deuteronomy 33:27 - "The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
    everlasting arms..."
    - `[Whiteboard: Deut 33:27 - REFUGE = Everlasting Arms]`
  - Isaiah 33:2 - "O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
    their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble."
    - This is a daily provision, especially needed in crisis.
  - `[Metaphor (from Deut 33:27): God's arms like the bedrock foundation under a house during an earthquake - unseen but absolutely secure.]`
- **Ongoing Reality:** Christ's High Priestly Ministry.
  - Hebrews 7:25 - He _ever liveth_ to make intercession. His arms are still
    outstretched in mediation.
    - `[Whiteboard: Heb 7:25 - Intercession = Ongoing Saving Power]`
  - This work continues until sin is eradicated.
- **The Confidence:** We can face anything sheltered in His care.
  - Psalm 91:4 - "He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
    shalt thou trust..."

  (Cross); His sustaining strength (Daily Power); His secure refuge (Everlasting

  living Christ. Place your weakness, your burdens, your future into His
  capable, everlasting arms.
