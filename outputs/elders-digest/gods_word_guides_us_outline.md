### Introduction (6 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a brief story or observation about feeling lost or
  needing direction in life or church ministry.
- **Context:** Introduce the setting of Acts 6 - rapid church growth leading to
  practical problems (v. 1).
  - **(RQ)** What happens when growth outpaces structure guided by God's
    priorities?
- **Central Theme:** Introduce the core idea: God's Word, faithfully prioritized
  and applied, is the divine guide for the church's life, ministry, and
  multiplication.
  - `[Whiteboard: God's Word -> Priority -> Application -> Multiplication (Acts 6:7)]`
- **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the study: Prioritizing the Word (Acts 6:2-4),
  Applying the Word (Acts 6:1, 5-6; James 1:22), and the Resulting Growth (Acts
  6:7; Matt 28:19-20).

### Section 1: The Priority of the Word (10 min)

- **The Problem & Apostolic Response (Acts 6:1-2):**
  - Murmuring arose – a practical need (widow care).
  - Apostles' assessment: Not right for them to leave the Word of God to serve
    tables (v. 2).
  - **(RQ)** Was practical ministry unimportant? Or was there a higher priority
    for _their_ calling?
  - `[Whiteboard: Apostles' Focus = Prayer + Ministry of the Word (Acts 6:4)]`
- **Establishing Priorities (Acts 6:3-4):**
  - Solution involved delegation _so that_ the Word remained central.
  - The apostles prioritized teaching and preaching – feeding the flock
    spiritually.
  - This wasn't neglect, but strategic focus based on divine calling.
  - Connection to modern church: Is the Word (teaching, study, preaching) truly
    central in our church life and personal schedules?
  - `[Write Question on Board (from Acts 6:4): What does 'give ourselves continually' to the Word look like today?]`

### Section 2: The Power & Application of the Word (12 min) [*]

- **The Word is Living and Active (Hebrews 4:12):**
  - It's not just ancient text; it's powerful, discerning thoughts and intents.
  - `[Whiteboard: Heb 4:12 - Word = Living, Powerful, Discerning]`
  - **(RQ)** How does recognizing the Word's power change how we approach it?
- **The Word Accomplishes God's Purpose (Isaiah 55:11):**
  - God promises His Word won't return void.
  - `[Analogy (from Isa 55:10-11): Word like rain/snow - brings life/fruit]`
- **The Word Demands Application (James 1:22; Acts 6:1, 3, 5-6):**
  - Hearing isn't enough; we must be _doers_.
  - The apostles' focus on the Word _led_ to a practical solution guided by the
    Word's principles (choosing spirit-filled men, caring for needy).
  - `[Whiteboard: Hear (Acts 6:2) -> Apply (Acts 6:3-6) -> Result (Acts 6:7)]`
  - The selection of deacons demonstrates applying spiritual principles (full of
    Holy Spirit and wisdom - v. 3) to practical needs.
  - Balancing Word (apostles) and Deed (deacons) – both are essential
    _applications_ of God's guidance.
  - `[Aside: Our church structures, from Sabbath School to community services, should be direct outflows of biblical instruction, not just tradition. They are labs for applying the Word we study.]`
- **Corporate Hearing (Implied in Acts context):** Importance of gathering to
  hear the Word together for shared understanding, encouragement, and
  commitment.

### Section 3: The Result of the Word (11 min)

- **The Word Increased (Acts 6:7a):**
  - Faithful proclamation and application led to the _spread_ and _influence_ of
    the message.
  - **(RQ)** What does it mean for the _Word_ itself to increase?
- **Disciples Multiplied (Acts 6:7b):**
  - Direct result of prioritizing and applying the Word.
  - Growth wasn't just addition, but _multiplication_.
  - `[Whiteboard: Faithful Word Ministry (Acts 6:4, 6) => Word Increases => Disciples Multiply (Acts 6:7)]`
- **Obedience to the Faith (Acts 6:7c):**
  - Even resistant groups (priests) were converted – demonstrating the Word's
    power (Heb 4:12).
- **Connection to the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20):**
  - Making disciples involves teaching them to observe _all_ that Christ
    commanded (His Word).
  - Acts 6 shows the _engine_ for fulfilling the commission: prioritizing,
    living, and sharing the Word.
  - Link to 3 Angels' Messages: Proclaiming the everlasting gospel (Word) leads
    to people coming out of Babylon and joining God's faithful remnant
    (multiplication/obedience).
  - `[Aside: Just as the early church turned the world upside down by prioritizing and living the Word, our urgent call today is to let that same Word transform us and fuel our witness in these last days.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** God's Word must be our priority (Acts 6:4), it's living and demands
  application (Heb 4:12, James 1:22), and when faithfully handled, it leads to
  spiritual growth and multiplication (Acts 6:7).
- **Practical Application Steps:**
  1.  **Prioritize Hearing:** Make corporate worship and personal study
      non-negotiable times to hear from God through His Word.
      `[Link to Acts 6:4]`
  2.  **Intentionally Apply:** Ask daily: How does the Word I read/heard today
      guide my actions, my service, my work, my relationships?
      `[Link to James 1:22, Acts 6:3-6]`
  3.  **Encourage Each Other:** Discuss the Word, hold each other accountable to
      live it out. `[Implied in corporate context]`
  4.  **Pray for Multiplication:** Pray for the Word to increase in our church
      and community, leading to more disciples.
      `[Link to Acts 6:7, Matt 28:19-20]`
- **Final Invitation:** Commit this week to taking one specific step to
  prioritize hearing and applying God's Word, trusting in its power to guide you
  and multiply His work through you. Let's be a people governed and energized by
  the living Word of God.
