### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Analogy of a building - needs strong pillars for stability and
  purpose (cf. 1 Tim 3:15 - church as pillar of truth).
- **Concept:** The Church needs 'pillars' - dedicated, responsible members
  committed to its mission (Gal 2:9). These are those found faithful in their
  stewardship (1 Cor 4:2) and committed to God's work (cf. Neh 4:6 - people had
  a mind to work).
  - [Whiteboard: CHURCH PILLARS (Gal 2:9) = Dedicated (Neh 4:6), Responsible (1
    Cor 4:2), Committed]
- **Problem:** Many feel inadequate for significant service, echoing biblical
  figures: lack ability (Exod 4:10 - Moses), courage (Judg 6:15 - Gideon), or
  wisdom (Jer 1:6 - Jeremiah; 1 Kings 3:7 - Solomon).
- **Study Purpose:** To see from Scripture how God equips _anyone_ He calls to
  be a pillar, overcoming inadequacy through His provision.
- **Central Truth Intro:** God doesn't call the equipped; He equips the called
  (cf. 2 Cor 3:5-6 - our sufficiency is from God; Phil 4:13).

### Section 1: The Call and the Common Hesitation (10 min)

- **The Need:** Church's mission is vast; workers are needed (Matt 9:37-38). The
  harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.
- **The Call:** Every member receives gifts for service (1 Cor 12:7, 11). This
  call is universal, distributed "severally as He will" for the common good.
- **The Hesitation:** Focus on common feelings of inadequacy, grounded in
  scripture examples:
  - Lack of perceived ability: "I am not eloquent... slow of speech" (Exod
    4:10).
  - Lack of courage/boldness: "my clan is the weakest... I am the least" (Judg
    6:15); disciples hiding "for fear" (John 20:19).
  - Lack of wisdom/understanding: "I do not know how to speak, for I am only a
    youth" (Jer 1:6); "If any of you lacks wisdom..." (James 1:5).
  - **(RQ)** How often do these feelings (voiced by Moses, Gideon, Jeremiah)
    prevent us from stepping forward in service, even in small ways God prompts
    (cf. Luke 16:10)?
- **Pillars in Galatians 2:9:** James, Cephas, John - recognized ("seemed to be
  pillars") for steadfastness and commitment, evident in their leadership and
  faithfulness (e.g., Acts 15). They weren't perfect (Gal 2:11-14), but they
  were dedicated pillars upholding the gospel.
- **Transition:** These feelings of inadequacy are real and biblically attested,
  but God's promises are greater and specifically address these weaknesses.

### Section 2: God's Provision - Overcoming Inadequacy [*] (12 min)

- **Foundation:** Jehovah Jireh - The Lord Will Provide (Gen 22:14). This
  applies not just to physical needs, but to the resources needed for His work.
  - [Whiteboard: JEHOVAH JIREH (Gen 22:14) = The Lord Will Provide]
- **Provision 1: Ability (Moses)**
  - Moses' Excuse: "I am not eloquent... slow of speech" (Exod 4:10).
  - God's Response: "Who hath made man's mouth?... I will be with thy mouth, and
    teach thee what thou shalt say." (Exod 4:11-12).
  - Principle: God provides the necessary _ability_ for the tasks He assigns
    (Exod 4:12). Our sufficiency is from Him (2 Cor 3:5). [Whiteboard: PROVISION
    1: ABILITY (Exod 4:12; 2 Cor 3:5)]
  - **(RQ)** What task has God placed before you where you feel you lack the
    ability (Exod 4:10)? How does God's promise in Exod 4:12 speak directly to
    that?
- **Provision 2: Courage (Gideon)**
  - Gideon's Fear: Felt insignificant, "my clan is the weakest... I am the
    least" (Judg 6:15).
  - God's Assurance: "The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valour... Surely
    I will be with thee" (Judg 6:12, 16).
  - Principle: God provides _courage_ through His promised presence, overcoming
    fear (Judg 6:16; cf. Josh 1:9 - "Be strong and courageous... for the Lord
    your God is with you"). [Whiteboard: PROVISION 2: COURAGE (Judg 6:16; Josh
    1:9)]
  - [Brief Illustration Concept: Contrast Gideon hiding by the winepress (Judg
    6:11) with Gideon leading 300 men against a vast army (Judg 7) - God
    empowers the fearful when they trust His presence.]
- **Provision 3: Power (Apostles)**
  - Disciples' state before Pentecost (fearful - John 20:19) vs. after (bold -
    Acts 4:13, 31).
  - God's Promise: "But ye shall receive _power_, after that the Holy Ghost is
    come upon you" (Acts 1:8).
  - Purpose: To be effective witnesses ("ye shall be witnesses unto me..." -
    Acts 1:8). [Whiteboard: PROVISION 3: POWER (Acts 1:8) -> Witness]
  - EGW Link (Supportive): Holy Spirit brings efficiency and qualification (Ref:
    Christian Service, p. 251 - "With the consecrated worker, He combines His
    divine power with human effort.").
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our Spirit-empowered lives become
    outposts of heaven, demonstrating God's kingdom principles (Rom 14:17) and
    power (1 Cor 4:20) in our daily sphere.
- **Provision 4: Wisdom (James)**
  - Need: Service requires discernment and understanding (cf. Solomon's request,
    1 Kings 3:9).
  - God's Promise: "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth
    to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him." (James
    1:5).
  - Condition: Ask in faith, without wavering (James 1:6). [Whiteboard:
    PROVISION 4: WISDOM (James 1:5) - Ask in Faith (James 1:6)]
  - Principle: God generously gives _wisdom_ needed for His work when asked
    sincerely in faith (James 1:5-6).

### Section 3: Activating God's Gifts - The Call to Action (12 min)

- **Untie Your Talents (Luke 19:29-31)**
  - Narrative: Jesus needed the colt for a specific purpose (His triumphal
    entry); it was found "tied" (Luke 19:30).
  - Application: Our God-given abilities, gifts, resources (cf. 1 Pet 4:10 -
    stewards of God's varied grace) can be 'tied up' by fear (Matt 25:25),
    neglect, or unwillingness.
  - **(RQ)** What gifts or abilities (1 Pet 4:10) has God given you that are
    currently 'tied' (Luke 19:30) and unused for His service, perhaps like the
    servant who hid his talent (Matt 25:18)?
  - Command: "Loose him, and bring him hither... The Lord hath need of him."
    (Luke 19:30-31). God requires our active participation and use of what He
    provides.
  - [Whiteboard: UNTIE YOUR TALENTS (Luke 19:30) - The Lord hath need! (cf. 1
    Pet 4:10)]
  - Connection: Parable of Talents (Matt 25:14-30) - accountability for using
    what God entrusts to us ("Occupy till I come," Luke 19:13 KJV).
- **Collective Effort - The Saving Net**
  - The Mission: Seeking and saving the lost (Luke 19:10) requires a concerted
    effort, like fishermen working together (cf. Luke 5:6-7 - nets breaking,
    partners helping).
  - [Analogy (from fishing): A single line catches few; a net, woven together
    (each member contributing), catches many.]
  - Biblical Basis: The church as the Body of Christ, each part working together
    effectively (1 Cor 12:12-27; Eph 4:16 - "the whole body... when each part is
    working properly, makes the body grow"). Unity is essential for witness
    (John 17:21).
  - Necessity: We need _all_ members actively engaged (Eph 4:16), forming a
    'saving net' through combined efforts in evangelism and nurture.
  - **(RQ)** How can our church better function as a 'net' (cf. Luke 5:6-7),
    combining individual strengths (1 Cor 12:7) for a greater impact, as
    described in Eph 4:16?
  - [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Like the colt (Luke
    19:30), our skills or resources, even if developed in secular contexts, can
    be consecrated (Rom 12:1) and powerfully used for God's purposes when we
    'untie' them for Him.

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** God calls _us_ to be pillars (Gal 2:9), faithful stewards (1 Cor
  4:2). Feelings of inadequacy are real but overcome by God's specific promises:
  - He provides Ability (Exod 4:12)
  - He provides Courage through His Presence (Judg 6:16; Josh 1:9)
  - He provides Power through His Spirit (Acts 1:8)
  - He provides Wisdom when asked in faith (James 1:5-6)
- **Challenge:** Reject excuses based on inadequacy (Exod 4:10; Judg 6:15).
  Trust Jehovah Jireh (Gen 22:14).
- **Action Steps (Review from Whiteboard):**
  1.  **Commit:** Accept God's call to be a dedicated pillar (Gal 2:9; 1 Cor
      4:2).
  2.  **Claim:** Identify your inadequacy (Ability? Courage? Power? Wisdom?).
      Find the corresponding promise (Exod 4:12; Judg 6:16/Josh 1:9; Acts 1:8;
      James 1:5) and claim it in faith (James 1:6).
  3.  **Untie:** Identify 1-2 specific talents/gifts (1 Pet 4:10). Pray about
      how to 'untie' them (Luke 19:30) for active service this week/month.
  4.  **Collaborate:** Seek ways to join efforts with others (Eph 4:16) in the
      church's mission (Matt 9:38).
- **Final Appeal:** Step forward in faith (Heb 11:6). Trust God to equip you (2
  Cor 3:5-6). Become the pillar He calls you to be (Gal 2:9). Let's build His
  church together (Eph 4:16), strong and effective for His glory.
