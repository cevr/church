**Opening Hymn:** #300 "Rock of Ages" "Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide

Be of sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power."

attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll; Whatever my lot, Thou hast
taught me to say, It is well, it is well with my soul."

**Central Bible Verse:** Joshua 7:11 - "Israel hath sinned, and they have also

even among their own stuff."

### Introduction (5 min)

- Recap Israel's stunning victory at Jericho (Joshua 6) - God's power
  demonstrated, walls fell supernaturally.
- The specific command regarding the spoils of Jericho (Joshua 6:17-19) -
  everything devoted to the Lord ("accursed" or _cherem_), except metals for the
  treasury. `[Write on board: Jericho Spoils = Cherem (Devoted/Forbidden)]`
- Transition to the next objective: Ai. Initial confidence based on past
  success.
- Introduce the theme: How hidden, seemingly "small" sins can undermine God's
  blessing, affect the entire community, and lead to unexpected failure.
- **(RQ)** After such a great victory, what could possibly go wrong?

### Section 1: Victory's Shadow - Defeat at Ai (8 min)

- **Apparent Success Breeds Carelessness:**
  - The spies' report on Ai: "Let not all the people go up; but let about two or
    three thousand men go up and smite Ai; make not all the people to labour
    thither; for they are but few." (Joshua 7:3). They underestimated the enemy
    and relied on their own assessment, not seeking God's specific guidance for
    _this_ battle.
  - `[Write on board: Spies' Report: "They are but few"]`
- **The Shocking Defeat:**
  - Israel sends about 3,000 men as suggested (Joshua 7:4a).
  - They are routed by the men of Ai: "they fled before the men of Ai." (Joshua
    7:4b).
  - Significant losses: "And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six
    men: for they chased them... and smote them in the going down" (Joshua
    7:5a).
  - The impact on morale: "wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became
    as water." (Joshua 7:5b). From Jericho's triumph to utter despair.
- **(RQ)** Why would God allow His people, fresh from victory, to suffer such a
  humiliating defeat? Was God unfaithful? (Hint: Look back at the command in
  Joshua 6:18).

### Section 2: Divine Diagnosis - Uncovering the Root [*] (10 min)

- **Joshua's Distress and God's Response:**
  - Joshua's reaction: Rends clothes, falls on his face, questions God (Joshua
    7:6-9). He assumes the problem is with God's power or plan.
  - God's direct answer: "Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?"
    (Joshua 7:10). God redirects Joshua from despair to the real issue.
  - The Problem Identified: "Israel hath sinned..." (Joshua 7:11a). God
    explicitly states the cause is not external weakness but internal
    corruption. `[Write on board: Cause of Defeat = SIN]`
- **The Nature of the Sin:**
  - Transgressed the covenant (Joshua 7:11b). Disobedience to a direct command.
  - Taken the "accursed thing" (_cherem_) (Joshua 7:11c). Violated the specific
    instruction about Jericho's spoils.
  - Stolen (Joshua 7:11d). Took what belonged solely to God.
  - Deceived ("dissembled") (Joshua 7:11e). Acted deceitfully, hiding the truth.
  - Hidden the evidence ("put it even among their own stuff") (Joshua 7:11f).
    Attempted to conceal the sin.
- **The Consequence and the Mandate:**
  - God's presence withdrawn: "Neither will I be with you any more, except ye
    destroy the accursed from among you." (Joshua 7:12). Sin separates from God
    and removes His blessing/protection.
  - The command: Sanctify the people, identify the guilty party through a
    process of elimination (tribe, family, household, individual), and deal with
    the sin decisively (Joshua 7:13-15).
- `[Aside: The process of casting lots (implied in v. 14-18) was a divinely guided method in the OT to reveal God's will in specific situations, not random chance. See Prov. 16:33.]`

### Section 3: The Anatomy and Cost of Sin (12 min)

- **The Culprit Identified:**
  - The process unfolds as God directed (Joshua 7:16-18). Tribe of Judah ->
    family of Zarhites -> household of Zabdi -> Achan son of Carmi.
  - `[Write on board: Judah -> Zarhites -> Zabdi -> Achan]`
- **Achan's Confession - The Progression of Sin:**
  - Joshua's plea: "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel,
    and make confession unto him..." (Joshua 7:19). Confession gives glory to
    God by acknowledging His omniscience and justice.
  - Achan's admission: "Indeed I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel..."
    (Joshua 7:20).
  - The steps:
    - "When I **saw** among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two
      hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold..." (Joshua 7:21a). Sin
      often begins with the eyes (cf. Eve, David).
    - "...then I **coveted** them..." (Joshua 7:21b). Desire follows sight. The
      heart entertains the temptation. (RQ) How does the 10th commandment relate
      here? (Exodus 20:17)
    - "...and **took** them..." (Joshua 7:21c). Desire leads to action.
    - "...and, behold, they are **hid** in the earth in the midst of my tent..."
      (Joshua 7:21d). Attempted concealment follows the act.
  - `[Write on board: Saw -> Coveted -> Took -> Hid]`
  - **Illustration:** Like a small crack in a dam, seemingly insignificant at
    first, but capable of causing catastrophic failure if ignored. Achan's
    "private" sin had public, devastating consequences.
- **The Terrible Cost:**
  - The stolen items recovered (Joshua 7:22-23). Sin will eventually be brought
    to light (Numbers 32:23).
  - The judgment executed: Achan, his family (implying complicity or shared
    responsibility under the theocratic covenant structure), his possessions,
    and the stolen goods are taken to the Valley of Achor (Trouble) (Joshua
    7:24).
  - The sentence: Stoning and burning, a complete removal of the offense (Joshua
    7:25). This harsh judgment underscored the holiness of God and the
    seriousness of disobeying His direct command, especially regarding things
    devoted to Him.
  - A monument of stones raised as a perpetual warning (Joshua 7:26).
    `[Write on board: Valley of Achor = Valley of Trouble]`

### Conclusion: From Trouble to Hope (10 min)

- **Need/Question (from text):** How does personal, hidden sin affect my
  relationship with God and my community? What happens when we disobey God's
  clear commands, even seemingly small ones? (Joshua 7:1, 11-12)
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** Hidden sin grieves God, breaks fellowship,
  invites consequences, and impacts the entire community of faith. Confession
  and decisive dealing with sin are necessary for restoration. (Joshua 7:11-13,
  19-21, 25-26). God requires holiness among His people.
- **Bridging (from text):** We may not face literal stoning today, but the
  principles remain. Secret sins (pride, envy, dishonesty, lust, bitterness)
  still damage our spiritual lives, hinder our witness, affect our families and
  church, and separate us from God's full blessing. (RQ) Are there "accursed
  things" (things God has forbidden or that take His place) hidden in our
  "tents" today?
- `[Aside: Ellen White comments on this account, emphasizing the far-reaching consequences of even one person's sin within the church body. See Patriarchs and Prophets, Ch. 45 "Achan's Sin and Its Punishment".]`
- **Actionable Steps (derived from text):**
  1.  **Examine:** Honestly ask God to reveal any hidden "Achan" (sin) in your
      heart through prayer and His Word (Psalm 139:23-24).
  2.  **Confess:** Specifically confess any known sin to God, acknowledging His
      holiness and your need for forgiveness (1 John 1:9). If others were
      wronged, seek reconciliation where appropriate.
  3.  **Forsake:** Make a conscious decision, with God's help, to turn away from
      the sin and remove it from your life (Proverbs 28:13). Replace the
      forbidden with devotion to God.
- **From Trouble to Hope:** The Valley of Achor ("Trouble") later becomes a
  symbol of hope through God's grace: "And I will give her her vineyards from
  thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope..." (Hosea 2:15). Where sin
  brought trouble, God can bring restoration and hope through repentance and His
  redeeming power in Christ.
- **Invitation:** Let us allow God to search our hearts today. Let's confess
  anything that hinders our fellowship with Him and each other, remove the
  "accursed things," and experience the joy and victory that comes from walking
  in obedience and holiness. Let the Valley of Trouble become a Door of Hope
  through Jesus Christ.
