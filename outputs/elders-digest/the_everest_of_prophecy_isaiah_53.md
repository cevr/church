### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce Isaiah 53: The "Mount Everest" of Messianic Prophecy.
  - Why? Unparalleled detail on the Messiah's identity and substitutionary
    suffering.
- Central Theme: Christ's sacrifice foretold with stunning accuracy.
- **RQ:** Why would God provide such a detailed, painful prophecy centuries
  before the event? (Purpose: Faith, Identification of Messiah - Isa 46:9-10)
- [Whiteboard: Isaiah 53 - The Suffering Servant Prophecy]

### Section 1: The Unexpected Messiah (Isa 53:1-3) (8 min)

- **Who hath believed our report? (v. 1)**
  - The message of a suffering, humble Messiah was unexpected, counter-cultural.
  - **RQ:** Do we sometimes resist truths that don't fit our expectations? (John
    1:11)
- **Tender plant, root out of dry ground (v. 2)**
  - Humble, unlikely origins; not worldly power/pomp.
  - Connect to Rev 22:16: The 'Root' (Divine) and 'Offspring' (Human) of David.
  - [Whiteboard: Root (Divinity - Rev 22:16) + Dry Ground (Humanity/Humble Birth
    - Isa 53:2)]
- **No form nor comeliness... despised and rejected of men (v. 2-3)**
  - He didn't meet worldly standards of appearance or status.
  - **RQ:** How easily do we judge based on externals, potentially missing God's
    work? (1 Sam 16:7)
- **A man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief (v. 3)**
  - He fully entered into the human experience of suffering.

### Section 2: The Substitute's Burden (Isa 53:4-6, 10) (12 min)

- **Surely he hath borne _our_ griefs, and carried _our_ sorrows (v. 4a)**
  - Crucial point: Substitution. It was _our_ burden He took.
  - [Whiteboard: OUR Griefs/Sorrows -> HIS Bearing (Isa 53:4)]
- **Yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted (v. 4b)**
  - The great misunderstanding: They thought His suffering was punishment for
    His _own_ sin.
- **But he was wounded for _our_ transgressions, bruised for _our_ iniquities
  (v. 5a)**
  - Direct causal link: His suffering was the consequence of _our_ sin.
  - [Write on board: Transgression (Rebellion) + Iniquity (Perversity) = OURS ->
    HIS Wounds (Isa 53:5)]
- **The chastisement of _our_ peace was upon him (v. 5b)**
  - His punishment secured _our_ reconciliation with God.
- **And with his stripes we are healed (v. 5c)**
  - His physical agony brings _our_ spiritual restoration.
  - [Analogy (from v. 5): Like a debt fully paid by another, His suffering
    cancels our spiritual debt.]
- **All we like sheep have gone astray... the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
  of us all (v. 6)**
  - Universal sinfulness met by a universal provision.
  - [Whiteboard: Our Straying (v. 6a) -> Iniquity Laid on HIM (v. 6b)]
- **Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief (v. 10a)**
  - Not delight in suffering, but satisfaction in the plan of redemption
    succeeding. (Ref EGW, DA 755-756 concept: Bearing the divine wrath against
    sin _in our place_).
  - **RQ:** How does grasping the _personal_ nature of His substitution ('for
    _my_ transgressions') deepen our gratitude?

### Section 3: Prophecy Fulfilled (Isa 53:7-9, 12) [*] (10 min)

- **He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth (v.
  7a)**
  - Prophecy of silent submission during trial.
  - Fulfilled: Matt 26:63; Matt 27:12-14.
  - [Whiteboard: Isa 53:7 -> Matt 26:63 (Silent Lamb)]
- **Brought as a lamb to the slaughter... as a sheep before her shearers is dumb
  (v. 7b)**
  - Perfect imagery of innocence, vulnerability, and non-resistance.
- **Taken from prison and from judgment... cut off out of the land of the living
  (v. 8a, c)**
  - Describes His unjust trial and execution.
- **For the transgression of my people was he stricken (v. 8d)**
  - Reiteration: His death was substitutionary.
- **Made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death (v. 9)**
  - Precise details: Crucified between thieves (wicked), buried in Joseph's tomb
    (rich). (Matt 27:38, 57-60).
- **He was numbered with the transgressors (v. 12a)**
  - Crucified alongside criminals.
  - Fulfilled: Mark 15:27-28.
- **He bare the sin of many (v. 12b)**
  - The essence of atonement.
- **Made intercession for the transgressors (v. 12c)**
  - Praying for His executioners and all sinners.
  - Fulfilled: Luke 23:34 ("Father, forgive them...").
  - [Aside: Christ's prayer on the cross wasn't just for the soldiers; it
    extends to every sinner He died for, including us when we reject Him. His
    intercession began even in His deepest agony.]
- Connect to Philippians 2:6-8: The divine self-emptying ('kenosis') that made
  this humiliation and sacrifice possible.

### Section 4: The Glorious Result & Our Response (Isa 53:11-12) (5 min)

- **He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied (v. 11a)**
  - The 'fruit' of His suffering: Redeemed souls ('new creatures' - 2 Cor 5:17).
  - His ultimate joy is our salvation.
- **By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many (v. 11b)**
  - Justification (being declared righteous) comes through knowing and accepting
    Him and His work.
  - [Whiteboard: His Sacrifice (Isa 53:5) -> Justification by Faith (Isa 53:11)]
- **For he shall bear their iniquities (v. 11c)**
  - Final emphasis on the substitutionary basis of justification.
- **Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great... because he hath
  poured out his soul unto death (v. 12a, c)**
  - His ultimate exaltation is the reward for His sacrifice. (Connect Phil
    2:9-11).
- [Aside: Studying prophecy like Isaiah 53 isn't just an academic exercise. It's
  like examining the blueprints of our salvation, showing God's meticulous plan
  and unwavering love long before the cross was ever erected.]

### Conclusion (5 min)

- Recap: Isaiah 53 stands as irrefutable evidence of God's foreknowledge and the
  identity of Jesus as the prophesied Suffering Servant and Substitute.
- The Core Message: The Everlasting Gospel is centered on Christ's death _in our
  place_ (Isa 53:5-6).
- Importance of Study (Ref EGW, SDA BC 4:1147 concept): Deep, prayerful study of
  Christ's sacrifice, especially His final hours and prophecies like Isaiah 53,
  is vital for spiritual life and transformation.
- **Practical Application:**
  - **Study:** Commit to reading Isaiah 53 prayerfully this week, perhaps
    alongside Matthew 26-27 or Mark 14-15. [Whiteboard: Action: Read Isa 53 +
    Gospel Passion Narrative]
  - **Accept:** Have you personally claimed His substitutionary death for _your_
    sins? Have you received the healing His stripes offer? **(RQ)**
  - **Reflect:** How does the reality of His sacrifice motivate your daily
    choices and witness?
- Final Appeal: Don't just admire the prophecy; embrace the Savior it reveals.
  Trust the One wounded _for you_. Accept His gift of peace and healing.
