### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Universal experience/fear of death. Is it only darkness?
- Introduce Paradox: Death = Enemy (Biblical view) vs. Potential Beauty/Release
  (Through Christ).
- State Purpose: Explore how God transforms the reality of death for the
  believer through the victory of Jesus Christ.
- Central Verse Introduction: 1 Cor 15:55 - A question of triumph, not despair.
- [Whiteboard: DEATH: Enemy? OR Release? -> 1 Cor 15:55]

### Section 1: Death - The Enemy Born of Sin (10 min)

- **The Origin:**
  - Not God's original plan (Gen 1:31 - "very good").
  - Result of Sin: Disobedience brought consequence (Gen 2:17; Rom 5:12).
  - Wages of Sin: Clearly defined (Rom 6:23a).
  - [Whiteboard: SIN (Rom 5:12) -> DEATH (Rom 6:23)]
  - Return to Dust: The physical sentence (Gen 3:19).
- **The Nature:**
  - An Enemy: Explicitly called the "last enemy" (1 Cor 15:26).
  - Brings sorrow, separation, decay (John 11:35 - Jesus wept).
  - **(RQ)** If death is an enemy introduced by sin, why does it feel so final
    and powerful in our experience? (Gen 3:19; Rom 6:23)

### Section 2: God's Timing - Finding Beauty in the Cycle [*] (10 min)

- **God's Sovereignty Over Time:**
  - Everything Beautiful in _His_ Time (Eccl 3:1-11). Read v. 11.
  - [Whiteboard: Eccl 3:11 - "Beautiful in His time"]
  - Cycles in Nature: Seed 'dies' to bring life (John 12:24), seasons change.
    [Analogy: Winter seems dead, but precedes spring life, all part of God's
    design].
  - Cycles in Life: Stages from birth to old age, each with purpose under God
    (Eccl 3:1-8).
- **Transforming the Ugly:**
  - The Cross: Instrument of torture/shame -> Symbol of ultimate love/victory
    (Gal 6:14).
  - [Whiteboard: Cross (Shame) --Resurrection--> Victory/Beauty]
  - Death for the Believer: God uses even this enemy event within His timing and
    redemptive plan.
  - **(RQ)** How can we trust God's timing (Eccl 3:11) when facing the
    'ugliness' and pain of death?
  - [Aside: Like finding a discarded, broken object and repurposing it into
    something beautiful and useful, God takes the curse of death, imposed by
    sin, and through Christ's sacrifice and resurrection, makes it a temporary
    passage to eternal glory for the faithful.]

### Section 3: Christ's Victory - The Sting Removed (12 min)

- **Christ's Conquest:**
  - He tasted death for everyone (Heb 2:9).
  - Destroyed him who had power of death (the devil) (Heb 2:14-15).
  - Firstfruits of the resurrection (1 Cor 15:20-23). Guarantees our own.
  - [Whiteboard: Christ's Death/Resurrection -> Victory over Grave (Heb 2:14)]
- **The Sting and Its Removal:**
  - The Sting = Sin (1 Cor 15:56). Death's power lies in sin's condemnation and
    separation from God.
  - Victory through Christ: He paid sin's penalty, offering forgiveness and
    reconciliation (Rom 6:23b; 1 Cor 15:57; 1 John 1:9).
  - [Whiteboard: STING = SIN (1 Cor 15:56) -> REMOVED by Christ's Blood (1 John
    1:7, 9)]
  - **(RQ)** If the sting (sin's condemnation) is removed for believers, why do
    we still physically die? (1 Cor 15:56-57)? (Answer: Physical death remains
    consequence of living in sinful world, but spiritual death/separation is
    overcome).
- **Death Re-Framed for Believers:**
  - A Sleep: Temporary state awaiting resurrection (John 11:11-14; 1 Thess
    4:13-14). Not annihilation.
  - A Blessed Release: From suffering, temptation, sin-marred body (Context:
    Phil 1:21-23; Rom 7:24 -> Rom 8:1). [Contrast: Enemy vs. Release *through
    Christ*].
  - [Write Question: How does knowing death is 'sleep' change how we grieve? (1
    Thess 4:13)]

### Conclusion & Application (8 min)

- **Recap:** Death entered through sin (Enemy - Gen 3; Rom 6:23). God works
  within time (Eccl 3:11). Christ conquered death, removing its ultimate sting
  (sin's condemnation) (1 Cor 15:55-57).
- **The Ultimate Beauty - Resurrection:**
  - The Promise: Christ's return brings resurrection (John 14:2-3; 1 Thess
    4:16).
  - Transformation: Mortal -> Immortal; Corruptible -> Incorruptible (1 Cor
    15:51-54).
  - [Whiteboard: 2nd Coming (John 14:3) -> Resurrection (1 Cor 15:52) -> Eternal
    Life]
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - **Need/Question (from text):** Knowing death is an enemy (1 Cor 15:26) and a
    consequence of sin (Rom 6:23), how do we face it—personally or in
    loss—without ultimate despair?
  - **Biblical Principle (from text):** Through Jesus Christ, death's sting
    (sin's power to condemn) is removed, and victory is assured through His
    resurrection and the promise of our own (1 Cor 15:55-57; John 14:2-3). Death
    becomes a temporary sleep (1 Thess 4:13-14).
  - **Bridging (from text):** In a world filled with loss and the fear of the
    unknown end, this biblical truth isn't just comfort; it's a transformative
    hope. It changes how we grieve (1 Thess 4:13) and empowers us to live
    differently now.
  - **Actionable Steps (from text):**
    1.  **Anchor in the Promise:** When fear or grief arises, consciously recall
        Christ's victory and His promise to return (John 14:1-3; 1 Cor 15:57).
        `[Write: Anchor: John 14:3]`
    2.  **Comfort with Hope:** Share the specific hope of the resurrection with
        fellow believers facing loss (1 Thess 4:18).
    3.  **Live Transformed:** Since Christ gives victory over sin (the sting),
        actively choose to live free from its dominion daily, reflecting the new
        life He offers (Rom 6:11-14; 1 Cor 15:58 - be steadfast).
  - **Invitation:** Will you choose today to fully embrace the hope found only
    in Christ's victory over death? Allow His promise of resurrection (1 Cor
    15:51-54) to transform how you view death and empower how you live each day
    for Him.
