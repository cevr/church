### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Start with a brief observation about the brokenness, division, and lack of genuine love seen in the world today. **(RQ)** Where do people typically look for love? Is it satisfying?
-   **The Need:** The world desperately needs true, enduring love. But what *is* it? Where does it come from?
-   **Study Goal:** Today, we'll explore the Bible, specifically 1 John, to understand the source, nature, and demonstration of the love that can truly heal and transform.
-   **Central Truth Intro:** Introduce 1 John 4:8. `[Write on board: GOD IS LOVE (1 John 4:8)]` This isn't just something God *does*, it's who He *is*.

### Section 1: God's Essential Nature - Love Defined (10 min)

-   **Foundation:** 1 John 4:8, 16 - "God is love." `[Re-emphasize on board]`
    -   Explore what this means: Not just loving, but love itself is His core being, His essence.
    -   Contrast with human love (often conditional, fleeting). God's love is the source, the standard.
    -   **(RQ)** If God *is* love, what does that imply about His actions, His law, His plan for us? `[Note verse refs on board]`
-   **Knowing God through Love:** 1 John 4:8b - "He that loveth not knoweth not God..."
    -   Experiencing and expressing God's kind of love is essential to truly knowing Him.
    -   It's not just intellectual assent; it's relational reality.
    -   `[Whiteboard: Knowing God <--> Loving Others (based on 1 John 4:8, 16)]`
-   **Eternal Nature:** God's love isn't temporary; it's everlasting (Jeremiah 31:3 - *briefly mention*).
    -   This provides security and hope unlike anything the world offers.

### Section 2: Love Manifested - The Cross & Christ's Life (12 min)

-   **The Ultimate Demonstration:** 1 John 4:9-10 - How God *showed* His love.
    -   `[Write on board: LOVE MANIFESTED (1 John 4:9-10)]`
    -   v. 9: Sent His Son that we might *live* through Him.
    -   v. 10: "Herein is love... He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins." `[Underline 'propitiation' on board - briefly explain: satisfies justice, enables mercy]`
    -   **(RQ)** How does the Cross uniquely reveal the depth and cost of God's love described in 1 John 4:8?
-   **Overwhelming Love:** 1 John 3:1 - "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God..."
    -   Focus on the word "manner" - what kind? Unprecedented, adopting enemies as children.
    -   `[Whiteboard: God's Love -> Adoption as Sons/Daughters (1 John 3:1)]`
-   **Love in Action - Christ's Example:**
    -   Jesus didn't just talk about love; He lived it.
    -   Example: Touching the leper (Mark 1:40-42). `[Briefly describe the social context - lepers were untouchable]`
        -   Demonstrated inclusive, compassionate, barrier-breaking love.
        -   **(RQ)** How did Jesus model the love described in 1 John?
    -   `[Concept: Jesus' life as a living commentary on 'God is love']`

### Section 3: Our Response - Compelled & Practical Love [*] (12 min)

-   **Love Compels Love:** 1 John 4:11 - "Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another."
    -   `[Write on board: God's Love IN -> Our Love OUT (1 John 4:11)]`
    -   It's not a suggestion; it's a logical, heartfelt response to His grace.
    -   **(RQ)** How does truly grasping God's love for *us* (1 John 4:9-10) change our motivation to love others?
-   **Love's Exclusivity:** 1 John 2:15-17 - "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world..."
    -   `[Whiteboard: Love God <--> NOT Love World (1 John 2:15)]`
    -   Clarify: Not hating people, but rejecting the *world's system* (lust of flesh, eyes, pride of life) which is opposed to God.
    -   **(RQ)** Why is love for God incompatible with love for the world's system, according to these verses?
    -   Connects to character: Choosing God's way over the world's way demonstrates genuine love for Him.
-   **Active & Practical Love:**
    -   Christian love isn't just a feeling; it's action (1 John 3:18 - *mention briefly* "not in word... but in deed and in truth").
    -   `[Aside: Our interactions, especially within the church family, are like billboards advertising the reality of God's love. Do our 'ads' reflect the truth of 1 John 4:8?]`
    -   **Need/Question:** How do we show this love practically?
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Follow Christ's example (Mark 1:40-42) and the command (1 John 4:11).
    -   **Bridge to Practice:** `[Analogy: God's love like a reservoir; our love for others should be the outflowing channel.]` How can we be channels this week?
    -   **Actionable Steps (from text):**
        1.  Reflect daily on God's love shown at the Cross (1 John 4:9-10). Let it motivate you.
        2.  Identify one person this week you can show practical, Christ-like love to (1 John 4:11; Mark 1:40-42 principle).
        3.  Consciously choose God's values over worldly allurements (1 John 2:15-17).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** Recap the core truths from 1 John:
    -   God *is* love (His nature - 1 John 4:8, 16).
    -   His love was supremely shown at the Cross (1 John 4:9-10).
    -   His love compels us to love others practically (1 John 4:11).
    -   True love for God excludes love for the world's system (1 John 2:15-17).
-   **The World's True Need:** The world doesn't just need *any* love; it needs *God's* love, reflected through His people.
-   `[Aside: Just as light automatically dispels darkness, living out God's love naturally pushes back against the selfishness and hate in the world. We are called to be light-bearers of His love.]`
-   **Invitation:**
    -   First, have you personally received this incredible love demonstrated at the Cross? (1 John 4:9-10)
    -   Second, will you commit to letting His love flow *through* you this week? (1 John 4:11)
    -   Choose one actionable step discussed and purpose to do it.
-   **Final Thought:** Abiding in His love (1 John 4:16) is the source of our ability to love. Let's seek Him daily.
