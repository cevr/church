**Outline:**

### Introduction: Welcoming as Worship (5 min)
- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- The Forgotten Virtue? Hospitality in a busy world. **(RQ)**
- Define Hospitality: Greek 'philoxenia' - love of strangers. `[Whiteboard: Φιλοξενία (Philoxenia) = Love of Strangers]`
- Not just entertaining friends, but extending God's love.
- Central Verse Introduction: Hebrews 13:2 - A surprising possibility.

### Section 1: The Command & Character of Hospitality (10 min)
- **A Divine Expectation:**
    - It's a command, not a suggestion: Romans 12:13. `[Whiteboard: Rom 12:13 - Command: "Given to hospitality"]`
    - Part of practical Christian living – distributing to needs.
    - Evidence of genuine faith: James 2:15-17 (Faith without works is dead). How does hospitality demonstrate living faith based on James 2? **(RQ)**
- **The Heart of Hospitality:**
    - Cheerful, not grudging: 1 Peter 4:9. `[Whiteboard: 1 Pet 4:9 - Attitude: "Without grudging"]`
    - Why "without grudging" according to the context of 1 Peter 4? What does grumbling reveal about our focus? **(RQ)**
    - Focus on sharing resources willingly (food, shelter, time).
    - It reflects God's own generous welcome to us (Eph 2:19).

### Section 2: Biblical Models & Priorities [*] (15 min)
- **Entertaining Angels:**
    - Abraham & the Visitors: Genesis 18:1-8.
        - Immediate, generous welcome to strangers.
        - Unknowing host to heavenly beings (Connect directly to Heb 13:2). `[Whiteboard: Gen 18 -> Heb 13:2 = Angels Unawares]`
        - What specific actions in Gen 18 demonstrate true hospitality? **(RQ)**
    - Rebekah's Family: Genesis 24:28-33. Welcoming the servant, providing for needs – proactive kindness.
- **Choosing the Better Part:**
    - Mary & Martha: Luke 10:38-42. `[Whiteboard: Luke 10:38-42]`
    - The Setting: Jesus visits their home.
    - Martha: Distracted by "much serving" (v. 40), anxious.
    - Mary: Focused on Jesus, listening at His feet (v. 39).
    - Jesus' Gentle Correction: Luke 10:41-42. `[Write on board: "One thing is needful" (v. 42)]`
    - The Lesson from the Text: Prioritizing fellowship with Christ and attention to His Word over excessive, anxious preparations. **(RQ)** How do we apply Luke 10:42 when hosting others for God?
    - True hospitality prioritizes relationship and love, not pretentious displays (Contrast with James 2:1-4).
    - [Aside: "Often, our desire to impress can overshadow our desire to connect. True hospitality, like Mary's focus in Luke 10, creates space for Christ to be the center, whether He's physically present or represented by a guest."]

### Section 3: Hospitality's Purpose & Reward (10 min)
- **Supporting the Gospel:**
    - Aiding God's Messengers: 3 John 5-8. `[Whiteboard: 3 John 5-8 = Fellowhelpers to the Truth]`
    - Providing for traveling ministers/workers = partnering in the truth (v. 8).
    - How does welcoming and supporting believers, as described in 3 John, advance God's kingdom work today? **(RQ)**
    - [Illustration Concept (from 3 John): Hospitality as providing essential support, like ground crew for pilots, enabling gospel messengers to fulfill their mission.]
- **Divine Recognition & Reward:**
    - Simple Acts Matter: Matthew 10:42 ("cup of cold water"). `[Whiteboard: Matt 10:42 = Small acts, great reward]`
    - Identifying with Christ: Matthew 25:35, 40 ("I was a stranger, and ye took me in... Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.").
    - Hospitality shown to others is received by Christ Himself.
    - Seeing Needs as Divine Appointments: Praying to be channels of God's love, recognizing opportunities highlighted in Matt 25.
    - [Aside: "Every knock at the door, every person needing help, can be seen not as an interruption, but as a divine appointment arranged by a loving Father seeking to bless both the giver and receiver through simple acts of kindness rooted in His Word, as seen in Matthew 25."]

### Conclusion & Practical Steps (5 min)
- **Summary:** Hospitality is more than meals; it's a heart attitude reflecting Christ's love (Philoxenia). It's commanded (Rom 12:13), requires cheerfulness (1 Pet 4:9), prioritizes people & Christ's presence (Luke 10), supports the gospel (3 John 5-8), and serves Christ Himself (Matt 25:35).
- **Living it Out (Action Steps derived from texts):** `[Whiteboard: Action Steps]`
    - Pray for eyes to see needs & a willing heart (Inspired by Matt 25:35).
    - Start simple: Offer that "cup of cold water" (Matt 10:42) - a listening ear, practical help.
    - Open your home (even simply) for fellowship/study (Applying Rom 12:13, 1 Pet 4:9).
    - Welcome newcomers at church/work/neighborhood (Living out 'philoxenia' - Heb 13:2).
    - Support those serving God tangibly (Following 3 John 5-8).
- **Final Appeal:** Let's ask God to make us truly hospitable, reflecting His welcoming heart to a world in need. Be "fellowhelpers to the truth" (3 John 8).
