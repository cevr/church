### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Common view: Law = external rules. Jesus' view: Law = heart
  transformation.
- Context: Sermon on the Mount (Matt 5-7) - Principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.
- Introducing the Standard: Read Matt 5:48. A challenging call! **(RQ)** What
  does this high standard mean for us today?
- [Write on board: Title & Matthew 5:48]
- Roadmap: We will explore how Jesus deepens our understanding of God's law,
  moving beyond mere actions to the thoughts and intents of the heart.

### Section 1: The Law Reaches the Heart (10 min)

- Foundation: Jesus fulfills, not destroys, the Law (Matt 5:17-20). He reveals
  its true spiritual intent.
- **Point 1: Anger & Murder (Matt 5:21-26)**
  - Read Matt 5:21-22. The Sixth Commandment goes beyond physical act.
  - Unrighteous anger, contempt ('Raca'), condemnation ('fool') are violations
    in God's eyes. **(RQ)** How seriously do we take sinful anger compared to
    physical violence?
  - [Write on board: Anger/Contempt -> Murder (Heart) - Matt 5:22]
  - Practical Urgency: Reconciliation precedes worship (Matt 5:23-26). Take the
    initiative.
- **Point 2: Lust & Adultery (Matt 5:27-30)**
  - Read Matt 5:27-28. The Seventh Commandment guards the heart's purity.
  - Sin begins with the look, the entertained thought. **(RQ)** Where does Jesus
    teach that the battle for purity is primarily fought?
  - [Write on board: Lustful Look -> Adultery (Heart) - Matt 5:28]
  - Practical Radicalness: Importance of guarding senses (eyes, thoughts) (Matt
    5:29-30). Requires decisive action against temptation.

### Section 2: Integrity and Response [*] (12 min)

- Focus: Kingdom righteousness reflected in our words and reactions.
- **Point 3: Honesty & Oaths (Matt 5:33-37)**
  - Read Matt 5:33-37. Beyond avoiding false oaths.
  - The standard: Simple, unadorned truthfulness. Let your 'Yes' mean Yes, 'No'
    mean No.
  - [Write on board: Simple Truthfulness - Matt 5:37]
  - ** (RQ)** Why the prohibition on oaths? (Points to the need for such
    inherent integrity that oaths become unnecessary).
  - [Aside: "Our word should be as reliable as a signed contract in God's
    kingdom. It reflects the character of Him who cannot lie (Titus 1:2).
    Integrity isn't just avoiding lies; it's living the truth."]
- **Point 4: Non-Retaliation (Matt 5:38-42)**
  - Read Matt 5:38-42. Moving beyond 'an eye for an eye'.
  - Kingdom response: Active non-resistance, surprising generosity.
  - [Write on board: Retaliation -> Generosity/Non-Resistance - Matt 5:39-42]
  - This isn't passive weakness, but reflects God's character of forbearance and
    mercy. **(RQ)** How does this principle challenge our cultural norms and
    personal instincts?
  - Practical Steps: Turning the cheek, giving the cloak, going the second mile,
    giving/lending freely.

### Section 3: The Standard of Love & Perfection (12 min)

- Focus: The pinnacle of Christ's teaching here – reflecting God Himself.
- **Point 5: Love for Enemies (Matt 5:43-47)**
  - Read Matt 5:43-45. Contrast: Common love (those who love you) vs. Divine
    love.
  - The Call: Love, bless, do good, and pray for persecutors.
  - [Write on board: Love Enemies -> Reflect God's Character - Matt 5:45]
  - ** (RQ)** Based on verse 44, what specific actions demonstrate this
    counter-cultural love?
  - [Analogy (from verse 45): God's impartial love seen in nature (sun/rain for
    all) is our model.]
- **Point 6: The Call to Perfection (Matt 5:48)**
  - Re-read Matt 5:48. What does 'perfect' (Gk: _teleios_) mean in this context?
  - Meaning: Complete, whole, mature, reaching the intended goal – reflecting
    the Father's character, particularly His impartial love (v. 45).
  - [Write on board: Perfect (*Teleios*) = Complete, Whole, Reflecting God's
    Character - Matt 5:48]
  - SDA Context: This is the high calling for God's people, especially vital for
    the final generation. It signifies complete surrender and transformation
    through Christ's power, resulting in a character that perfectly mirrors His.
  - [Aside: "This call to perfection isn't a burden to achieve alone, but an
    invitation to allow Christ's perfecting grace to fully transform us, making
    us fit representatives of His kingdom as we near His return."]
  - Power Source: This standard is unattainable by human effort alone. It
    requires God's grace, the indwelling Holy Spirit, and moment-by-moment
    connection with Christ (John 15:5, Phil 4:13).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- Summary Recap: Jesus reveals the law's depth – it judges motives, attitudes,
  and thoughts, demanding heart righteousness.
- The Divine Standard: We are called to reflect God's perfect character – His
  love, integrity, purity, and mercy.
- The Enabling Power: This perfection is not self-generated but is the work of
  Christ _in_ us through faith (Gal 2:20). It's the fruit of justification and
  the process of sanctification.
- Personal Application: **(RQ)** Which area discussed today (anger, purity,
  honesty, response to injury, love for enemies) is the Spirit highlighting for
  _your_ growth?
- [Whiteboard: Action Step? Choose one area for focused prayer/surrender this
  week.]
- Final Invitation: Let us surrender fully to Jesus, asking Him to write His law
  on our hearts (Heb 8:10) and empower us by His grace to grow towards the
  perfection He calls us to, reflecting His character ever more completely.
