### Introduction (5 min)
-   Setting the Scene: Calvary, the final moments, darkness, weight of sin.
-   The Fifth Word: "I thirst." (John 19:28)
    -   [Whiteboard: Title & John 19:28]
-   Purpose: Explore the depths of this cry – physical agony, prophetic precision, spiritual yearning.
-   **(RQ)** Among profound declarations, why this simple, human cry? What layers of meaning does it hold?

### Main Content 1: The Physical Reality & Prophetic Fulfillment (12 min)
#### The Human Suffering of Christ
-   Intense physical agony described (effects of crucifixion, blood loss, exposure leading to severe thirst).
-   Identification with humanity (Hebrews 2:17-18) - He truly felt our infirmities.
#### Prophecy Fulfilled - Physical Thirst
-   Psalm 22:15 - "My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws..."
    -   [Whiteboard: Prophecy -> Fulfillment: Ps 22:15 -> John 19:28]
-   **(RQ)** How does seeing specific OT prophecies fulfilled in Christ's suffering confirm His identity as Messiah?
#### Prophecy Fulfilled - The Drink Offered
-   Initial Refusal: Wine mingled with gall (Matt 27:34) - A stupefying drink.
    -   Why refuse? To face death and conquer sin with a clear mind, unclouded senses (Desire of Ages, p. 746).
-   Later Acceptance: Vinegar on hyssop (John 19:29; Matt 27:48).
    -   Psalm 69:21 - "...in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink."
    -   [Whiteboard: Ps 69:21 -> Matt 27:48 / John 19:29]
-   Significance of Hyssop:
    -   Passover connection (Exodus 12:22): Applying blood for deliverance.
    -   Cleansing connection (Leviticus 14:4-7; Psalm 51:7): Symbol of purification.
    -   [Whiteboard: Hyssop = Passover (Ex 12:22) + Cleansing (Lev 14/Ps 51:7)]
    -   **(RQ)** What does the detail of the hyssop teach about the *purpose* of Christ's suffering and death? (Points to purification/cleansing available through His sacrifice).

### Main Content 2: The Spiritual Thirst [*] (12 min)
#### Beyond Physical Need
-   **(RQ)** Was Jesus *only* physically thirsty, or did this cry express a deeper longing?
-   The cry came *after* knowing "all things were now accomplished" (John 19:28) - pointing beyond mere physical need.
#### Thirst for Souls
-   A profound yearning for the salvation of every soul He came to redeem (Luke 19:10).
-   Felt keenly during the separation from the Father under the weight of sin (Matt 27:46).
-   [Analogy (from John 4): Humanity, like the woman at the well, seeks satisfaction in broken cisterns (Jer 2:13), leaving the soul thirsty.]
#### The Unsatisfying Nature of Sin
-   Sin promises satisfaction but leaves the soul empty and thirsty.
-   Contrast with the Living Water Christ offers (John 4:13-14) - true, lasting satisfaction.
    -   [Whiteboard: Sin = Unsatisfying Thirst vs. Christ = Living Water (John 4:14)]
-   **(RQ)** Where do we see people today trying (and failing) to quench their spiritual thirst apart from Christ?
-   [Aside: *"Just as dehydration affects every part of the physical body, separation from God, the source of life, affects every part of our spiritual being. Christ's thirst highlights the desperate human need only He can fill."*]

### Main Content 3: Our Response - Satisfying the Savior's Thirst (10 min)
#### How Can We Satisfy Christ's Ongoing Thirst?
-   He still thirsts – for our response: penitence, love, full consecration.
-   **(RQ)** If Christ still thirsts for souls, how is that thirst quenched *today*?
#### Ministering to Others = Ministering to Christ
-   Matthew 25:35 - "For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink..."
-   Matthew 25:40 - "...Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."
    -   [Whiteboard: Our Actions -> Christ: Matt 25:35, 40]
-   Practical Application: Meeting the needs (physical & spiritual) of others is a direct service to Christ, satisfying His heart's longing.
-   [Aside: *"When we offer a cup of cold water, a listening ear, or share the Gospel message, we are, in a real sense, offering relief to the thirst Christ expressed on the cross – His thirst for connection and salvation for every soul."*]
#### Actionable Steps (Derived from Matt 25 & Spiritual Thirst)
-   [Whiteboard: Action Steps]
    -   1. This week: Identify & meet a physical need (food, drink, etc.) for someone. (Matt 25:35)
    -   2. This week: Share the "Living Water" (hope, testimony, invitation) with someone spiritually thirsty. (John 4:14; Matt 25:40)
    -   3. Daily: Pray for opportunities to satisfy Christ's thirst through loving service.
