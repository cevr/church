**Opening Hymn:** #359 "Hark! the Voice of Jesus Calling" "Hark! the voice of
Jesus calling, ‘Who will go and work today? Fields are white and harvests
waiting, Who will bear the sheaves away?’ Loud and long the Master calleth, Rich
reward He offers free; Who will answer, gladly saying, ‘Here am I, send me, send
me’?”

**Closing Hymn:** #600 "Hold Fast Till I Come" "O Lord of hosts, who didst
fulfill Thy work, Thy plan divine, And bid Thy faithful ones stand still And see
Thy glory shine: To us in times of doubt and fear A promise Thou dost send; Thou
sayest, ‘Lo, I will be near, Be faithful to the end.’”

### Introduction (5 min)

- Setting the Scene: Moses, a shepherd in Midian, seemingly forgotten (Acts
  7:29-30).
- The Unexpected Encounter: The Burning Bush - God initiating contact.
- God's Purpose: Not random, but a specific, divine assignment (Ex 3:7-10).
- Common Human Reaction: When God calls, we often hesitate. Why? **(RQ)**
- Thesis: Examining Moses' excuses reveals our own tendencies and God's
  unwavering sufficiency for His call.
- [Write on board: God Calls -> Human Excuses -> God Provides]

### Section 1: The Divine Summons (10 min)

- **God Calls Individuals to Specific Tasks** (Exodus 3:1-10)
  - The Sacred Ground: God's presence demands reverence (Ex 3:5).
  - God Sees & Hears: Awareness of His people's suffering (Ex 3:7, 9).
  - God's Plan: Deliverance and inheritance (Ex 3:8).
  - The Specific Call: "Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto
    Pharaoh..." (Ex 3:10).
  - [Whiteboard: God's Call (Ex 3:10) = Specific Task (Deliverance/Evangelism)]
  - Connection to Us: God still calls individuals today for His work, primarily
    the Gospel Commission (Mark 16:15). **(RQ)** How does He call us?

### Section 2: The Human Hesitation [*] (12 min)

- **Excuse 1: Feelings of Inadequacy** (Exodus 3:11)

  - Moses: "Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh...?"
  - Focus on self vs. God's power.
  - Relatable Feeling: We often feel unqualified, insignificant. **(RQ)**
  - God's Answer: **Presence** - "Certainly I will be with thee" (Ex 3:12a). The
    focus shifts from 'who I am' to 'Who is with me'.
  - [Whiteboard: Excuse: "Who am I?" (Self-Focus) -> God's Answer: "I AM with
    you" (God-Focus) - Ex 3:11-12]

- **Excuse 2: Lack of Knowledge/Authority** (Exodus 3:13)

  - Moses: "...they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto
    them?"
  - Fear of not having the right answers or credentials.
  - God's Answer: **Revelation** - "I AM THAT I AM" (Ex 3:14). God reveals His
    self-existent, eternal nature as the basis of authority.
  - [Write on board: God's Name = His Character & Authority (Ex 3:14-15)]
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our witness isn't based on our own
    credentials, but on representing the King whose name we bear. We speak for
    'I AM'.]

- **Excuse 3: Fear of Rejection/Disbelief** (Exodus 4:1)
  - Moses: "But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice..."
  - Anticipating failure and opposition.
  - God's Answer: **Power & Signs** - Rod to serpent, leprous hand restored,
    water to blood (Ex 4:2-9). God provides evidence of His power.
  - [Whiteboard: Fear: "They won't believe" -> God's Answer: Divine Power/Signs
    (Ex 4:2-9)]
  - Connection: God confirms His Word with power (Heb 2:4). We rely on the Holy
    Spirit's power, not just human persuasion.

### Section 3: God's Persistent Provision (12 min)

- **Excuse 4: Lack of Personal Ability (Eloquence)** (Exodus 4:10)

  - Moses: "O my Lord, I am not eloquent... I am slow of speech, and of a slow
    tongue."
  - Focusing on perceived personal limitations.
  - God's Answer: **Sufficiency & Enablement** - "Who hath made man's mouth? ...
    Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou
    shalt say." (Ex 4:11-12).
  - [Whiteboard: Excuse: "I can't speak well" -> God's Answer: "I made your
    mouth; I will teach you" (Divine Sufficiency) - Ex 4:11-12]
  - Key Principle: God equips those He calls. Our sufficiency is _of God_ (2 Cor
    3:5). His strength is made perfect in weakness (2 Cor 12:9).
  - [Analogy (from 2 Cor 12:9): Like a cracked vessel, our weakness allows God's
    light/power to shine through more clearly.]

- **Excuse 5: Outright Unwillingness** (Exodus 4:13)

  - Moses: "O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt
    send."
  - Moving beyond specific fears to simple reluctance.
  - God's Reaction: **Displeasure & Assistance** - "And the anger of the Lord
    was kindled against Moses..." (Ex 4:14a). God provides Aaron, but notes
    Moses' resistance.
  - God provides human assistance (Aaron) but doesn't negate the original call
    (Ex 4:14-16).
  - Warning: Persistent refusal stems from unwillingness, not inability, and
    displeases God.
  - [Aside: Instead of focusing on what we lack, we can see challenges as
    opportunities. It's like finding a coin—even from a worldly system (our
    perceived lack), we can put it to God's kingdom work by trusting His
    provision.]

- **The Core Application: Overcoming Excuses for the Gospel Commission**
  - The Call Today: "Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
    creature." (Mark 16:15).
  - Our Excuses: Same patterns - inadequacy ("Who am I to witness?"), lack of
    knowledge ("What if they ask hard questions?"), fear ("They'll reject me/the
    message"), lack of ability ("I'm not a good speaker/writer"). **(RQ)** Which
    excuse resonates most?
  - God's Promises Remain: His Presence (Matt 28:20), His Word/Message (Bible),
    His Power (Acts 1:8), His Sufficiency (Phil 4:13).
  - [Whiteboard: Our Excuses vs. God's Promises (Matt 28:20, Acts 1:8, Phil
    4:13)]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- Recap: God calls -> We make excuses based on fear/inadequacy -> God
  consistently offers His presence, power, and provision.
- The Real Issue: Not ability, but _willingness_ and _trust_. Do we believe
  God's promises more than our perceived limitations? **(RQ)**
- Moses Eventually Obeyed: Despite his hesitation, he went. God used him
  mightily.
- The Choice: Will we continue making excuses, or will we trust God's "I will
  certainly be with thee" (Ex 3:12) and "I can do all things through Christ
  which strengtheneth me" (Phil 4:13)?
- Gentle Invitation: Identify one excuse you commonly use. This week,
  consciously choose to trust God's promise related to that excuse and take one
  small step in obedience to His call (e.g., share a testimony, give a Bible
  study tract, invite someone to church).
- Final Thought: God isn't looking for ability, but availability and trust.
