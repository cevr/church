### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a simple question about gardening or farming. Who does
  what? What part can the farmer control, and what part is beyond their control?
- **Connect to Spiritual Work:** Introduce the idea that sharing our faith is
  like spiritual gardening – a partnership.
- **Central Theme:** Today we explore our specific role and God's distinct role
  in bringing people to Him, based primarily on 1 Corinthians 3.
- **Objective:** To understand our responsibility clearly so we can be faithful,
  and to trust God fully with the results He alone can bring.
- `[Whiteboard: Title - Our Part, God's Power]`
- **(RQ):** Have we ever felt discouraged in outreach, perhaps because we
  misunderstand our role versus God's?

### Section 1: Our God-Given Role: Planting & Watering (12 min)

- **Foundation Text:** Read 1 Corinthians 3:5-7.
- **Defining Our Role (v. 5):**
  - Paul calls himself and Apollos "ministers" (servants, instruments).
  - `[Whiteboard: Believers = Servants/Instruments (1 Cor 3:5)]`
  - We are the means _through whom_ people believe, as the Lord gives
    opportunity.
  - **(RQ):** What does it mean to see ourselves primarily as 'servants' in
    God's work, rather than the 'stars'?
- **The Actions: Planting & Watering (v. 6a):**
  - "I planted" (Paul started the work in Corinth - Acts 18).
  - "Apollos watered" (He followed up, built on the foundation - Acts 18:24-28).
  - `[Whiteboard: Our Actions: Plant (Share Gospel) & Water (Nurture, Teach)]`
  - **Planting:** Sharing the initial Gospel message, sowing the seed of truth.
  - **Watering:** Nurturing new interest, teaching, encouraging, discipling.
  - Connect to the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20): Making disciples
    involves _both_ initial outreach ('go', 'teach/baptize') and ongoing nurture
    ('teaching them to observe all things').
  - **(RQ):** In our church or personal lives, where do we see opportunities for
    'planting'? Where for 'watering'? Are we active in both?
- **Key Takeaway:** Our role is active, intentional participation in sharing and
  nurturing God's truth.

### Section 2: God's Sovereign Work: The Increase [*] (10 min)

- **The Crucial Distinction (v. 6b-7):** "...but God gave the increase."
  - Emphasize the contrast. Human effort (planting/watering) is necessary but
    insufficient.
  - `[Whiteboard: God's Action: Gives the Increase (1 Cor 3:6-7) = Conversion/Growth]`
  - Verse 7 reinforces: The human agents are 'nothing' in terms of _causing_
    salvation; the power belongs entirely to God.
  - **(RQ):** Why is it vital to understand that _we_ don't cause conversion?
- **The Nature of the 'Increase': The New Birth**
  - This 'increase' is spiritual life, conversion, regeneration.
  - Reference John 3:3, 5-8: Jesus emphasizes being 'born again,' 'born of the
    Spirit.' This is a divine miracle, not a human achievement.
    - `[Write on board: John 3:8 - Spirit like wind - sovereign action]`
  - Reference 1 Peter 1:3: We are 'begotten... again' by God Himself.
  - **(RQ):** How does knowing conversion is the Spirit's work (John 3:8) free
    us from pressure and potential pride?
- **Dependence on the Holy Spirit:** Our planting and watering are useless
  without the Spirit working on hearts to convict, convince, and convert.
- `[Analogy (from 1 Cor 3): Farming - We prepare soil, plant seed, water, weed... but cannot *make* the seed sprout and grow into a mature plant. That life-giving power is God's alone.]`

### Section 3: Faithful Partnership in Practice (12 min)

- **Bridging Principle to Action:** Knowing our role and God's role, how do we
  faithfully partner with Him?
- **Intentional Planting & Watering:**
  - Actively look for opportunities to share truth (plant seeds).
  - Be deliberate in nurturing relationships with seekers and new believers
    (water).
  - Example: Welcoming visitors warmly, making them feel comfortable, inviting
    them back, offering Bible studies.
  - `[Whiteboard: Practical Steps: 1. Intentional Sharing 2. Welcoming/Nurturing 3. Prayer]`
  - **(RQ):** What is one specific way our church (or I personally) could be
    more intentional about 'planting' or 'watering' this month?
- **The Necessity of Prayer:**
  - Since God gives the increase, prayer is not optional but essential.
  - Pray for opportunities, for boldness, for wisdom (James 1:5).
  - Pray earnestly for the Holy Spirit to work on specific hearts, bringing
    conviction and conversion.
  - `[Hypothetical Concept (based on 1 Cor 3): Imagine two gardeners. One works tirelessly but never asks for rain. The other works diligently AND prays for rain. Which garden is more likely to flourish? Our outreach needs diligent work AND earnest prayer for God's 'increase'.]`
- **Total Commitment:**
  - Connect to the idea of being God's 'servants'. This requires full surrender.
  - Quote EGW: "We do not belong to Christ unless we are His wholly." (COL
    48.3 - context of talents/service).
  - `[Write on board: Wholly His = Faithful Servants]`
  - Our effectiveness as instruments depends on our connection to the Master.
  - [Aside: "Sometimes we treat outreach like a side project. But if we are
    wholly His, being His witnesses becomes central to who we are, naturally
    flowing into our conversations and actions, not just a scheduled event."]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap Key Truths:**
  - God calls us to be active participants – servants who plant and water (1 Cor
    3:5-6a).
  - Conversion and spiritual growth are God's sovereign work – He gives the
    increase (1 Cor 3:6b-7; John 3).
  - `[Point to Whiteboard sections: Our Role / God's Role]`
- **Freedom and Responsibility:** This understanding frees us from the burden of
  'making' converts, but calls us to faithfulness in our assigned tasks.
- **Call to Action:**
  - Commit to being faithful 'planters' and 'waterers' in your sphere of
    influence.
  - Commit to earnest prayer, asking for the Holy Spirit's power for the
    'increase'.
  - **(RQ):** Will you embrace your role as God's servant in outreach this week,
    trusting Him completely with the results?
- **Final Encouragement:** Be faithful. Your labor is not in vain _in the Lord_
  (1 Cor 15:58), because He is the one who ultimately brings the harvest.
