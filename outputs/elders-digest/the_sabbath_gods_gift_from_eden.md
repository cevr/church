### Introduction (5 min)

-   **Hook:** Imagine the perfect world, fresh from God's hand. What was the very first *full* day Adam and Eve experienced? (The Sabbath - a day blessed and set apart before sin entered).
-   **Topic Intro:** The Seventh-day Sabbath - not a later addition, but foundational, woven into the fabric of Creation itself.
-   **Central Verse Focus:** Genesis 2:3 - God's own actions established this day. `[Write Gen 2:3 on board]`
-   **Study Goal:** To explore the origin, divine purpose, and practical blessing of the Sabbath, letting Scripture guide us.

### Section 1: Established at Creation (12 min)

-   **Context:** Creation week complete (Gen 1). Genesis 2:1 - "Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them."
-   **God's Example (Gen 2:2):** "And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made."
    -   **(RQ)** Did God *need* physical rest? (No - He doesn't weary. Isa 40:28). This 'rest' signifies completion, cessation of creative work, and setting a divine pattern.
    -   `[Whiteboard: GOD RESTED (Gen 2:2) = Ceased Creating + Set Example]`
-   **God's Actions (Gen 2:3):** "And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it..."
    -   **Blessed:** Infused with special divine favor; intended as a source of blessing for humanity. `[Write on board: BLESSED (Gen 2:3) = Divine Favor Endowed]`
    -   **Sanctified:** Set apart for a holy purpose; consecrated; hallowed. `[Write on board: SANCTIFIED (Gen 2:3) = Set Apart for Holy Use]`
    -   **(RQ)** What does it mean for *time itself* to be blessed and set apart by God? How should that affect our approach to it?
-   **The Reason Why - Memorial of Creation (Gen 2:3b):** "...because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."
    -   A perpetual reminder of *Who* is the Creator.
    -   Directly linked in the Commandment: Exodus 20:11 - "For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it." `[Write Ex 20:11 on board - shows continuity]`
    -   It anchors our identity in God as our Maker.

### Section 2: Purpose and Significance (12 min)

-   **Made for Humanity (Mark 2:27):** Jesus affirmed its purpose: "The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath."
    -   Not a burden, but a gift for our benefit: physical rest, spiritual refreshment, relationship building.
    -   `[Analogy (from Mk 2:27): Like a loving parent setting aside special time *for* the child, not demanding the child serve the schedule.]`
    -   **(RQ)** If the Sabbath was made *for* us, how might we be missing its intended blessings?
-   **Remembrance & Relationship:**
    -   **Remembering Creation (Ex 20:8, 11):** Actively recalling God as our source fosters humility, dependence, and worship.
    -   **Remembering Redemption (Deut 5:15):** Israel was told to remember deliverance from Egypt. For us, it points to deliverance from sin through Christ. `[Note Deut 5:15 link on board - Creation & Redemption]`
    -   Dedicated time fosters deeper communion with God, free from worldly distractions.
-   **Sign of Loyalty & Sanctification (Ezek 20:12, 20):**
    -   "Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them." (Ezek 20:12)
    -   Observing God's Sabbath acknowledges His authority as Creator and Lord.
    -   It's an outward sign of an inward commitment to His sanctifying work.
    -   **(RQ)** In a world offering many alternatives for worship and rest, how does keeping the *seventh-day* Sabbath specifically demonstrate loyalty to the Creator God of the Bible?

### Section 3: Sabbath in the Last Days & Practical Holiness [*] (10 min)

-   **End-Time Centrality (Rev 14:7):** The first angel's message calls the world to "Fear God, and give glory to him... and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters."
    -   This language directly echoes the Sabbath commandment (Ex 20:11). `[Draw arrow on board: Ex 20:11 -> Rev 14:7]`
    -   Identifying and worshipping the Creator is a key issue in the final conflict.
    -   The Sabbath becomes a banner of allegiance to the true God.
    -   `[Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Sabbath observance within them reinforces this distinction.]`
-   **How to Keep it Holy (Isaiah 58:13-14):** God gives clear instruction.
    -   `[Write Isa 58:13-14 Key Phrases on board]`
    -   **Verse 13:**
        -   "Turn away thy foot... from doing thy pleasure on my holy day" -> Cease secular pursuits, personal business, ordinary work. `[Whiteboard Point: Cease Secular Activity]`
        -   "Call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honourable" -> Attitude: Joyful anticipation, reverence, respect. `[Whiteboard Point: Attitude = Delight, Honor]`
        -   "Shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words" -> Shift focus entirely from self to God. This includes conversation and even thought patterns. `[Whiteboard Point: God-Centered Focus (Actions, Words, Thoughts)]`
    -   **Verse 14:** The Result: "Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord..."
    -   **(RQ)** Based on Isaiah 58, what does 'not speaking thine own words' practically mean for our Sabbath conversations?
-   **Practical Application Framework:**
    -   **Need:** Distraction, worldliness creeping into holy time.
    -   **Biblical Principle:** Sabbath requires intentional separation unto God (Gen 2:3, Isa 58:13).
    -   **Bridging:** `[Aside: Think of Friday preparation like setting the stage for a royal guest. We clear away the clutter of the week so we can fully focus on honoring the King when He arrives with the Sabbath blessing.]`
    -   **Action Steps:** 1. Plan ahead (finish work/chores Friday). 2. Guard conversation - focus on spiritual themes. 3. Engage in worship, fellowship, nature, acts of mercy (Matt 12:12). `[Whiteboard: Action Steps - Prepare Fri, Guard Conv., Holy Activities]`

### Conclusion (6 min)

-   **Recap:** The Sabbath is not merely a rule, but God's foundational gift from Eden (Gen 2:1-3).
    -   Blessed and sanctified by God Himself.
    -   A memorial of His creative power (Ex 20:11).
    -   A sign of relationship and loyalty (Ezek 20:12).
    -   Crucial in the end-time call to worship the Creator (Rev 14:7).
-   **Holiness in Practice:** True observance, as outlined in Isaiah 58:13-14, involves intentional separation and focus on God, leading to delight.
-   **Invitation:** God invites us weekly into this sacred time He established at Creation. Will we accept His gift fully? Will we cease from our own works to enter His rest, honor Him as Creator, and experience the delight He promises? Let's commit to making the Sabbath the holy, joyful communion God intended.
