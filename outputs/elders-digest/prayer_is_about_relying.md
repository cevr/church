### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** The universal struggle with temptation. We all face it. **(RQ)** How
  often does temptation feel overwhelming, like a current pulling us under?
- **Prayer as Reliance:** Introduce the concept – prayer isn't just asking, it's
  fundamentally about _relying_ on God's strength, especially against sin. It's
  grabbing the lifeline He offers.
- **Central Verse:** Introduce Matthew 6:13. This isn't about God leading us
  _to_ sin, but praying for His guidance _away_ from situations where we are
  weak, or for His strength _through_ trials, delivering us from the _Evil One_.
  [Write on board: Matt 6:13 - Deliverance, Not Enticement].
- **Study Roadmap:** Briefly outline the flow: Understanding where temptation
  _really_ comes from (James 1, Eph 6), recognizing our need for help and
  Christ's unique ability to provide it (Heb 2), and discovering how to access
  God's power for victory through active reliance (1 Cor 10, Rom 6).

### Section 1: Understanding Temptation's Source (10 min)

- **God Does Not Tempt:**
  - James 1:13 - "Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am tempted by God'; for
    God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone."
    [Whiteboard: James 1:13 = God ≠ Source of Temptation].
  - **(RQ)** Why is it vital to settle this first – that God is not the source
    of our temptations? (Affects trust, understanding His character).
  - `[Aside: The Greek word for "tempted" here (peirazō) can mean both "to test/prove" and "to entice to sin." James makes it clear God may allow tests, but He never entices to evil.]`
- **Source 1: Our Own Fallen Nature:**
  - James 1:14-15 - "But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by _his own
    desires_ and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to
    sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death." [Whiteboard: James
    1:14-15 Flow: Desire -> Enticement -> Sin -> Death].
  - Clarification: Temptation itself isn't sin; yielding (letting desire
    conceive) is (James 1:15).
- **Source 2: The External Adversary:**
  - Ephesians 6:11-12 - "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
    stand against the _wiles of the devil_. For we do not wrestle against flesh
    and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of
    the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the
    heavenly places." [Whiteboard: Eph 6:11-12 = Spiritual Battle vs. Devil's
    Schemes].
  - Satan exploits our weaknesses and desires (cf. Christ's temptation, Matt
    4:1-11). He's the external pressure.

### Section 2: Our Need & Christ's Provision [*] (12 min)

- **Acknowledging Personal Weakness:**
  - Context of Romans 7:18-24 (Read key phrases like v. 18 "in my flesh nothing
    good dwells," v. 24 "O wretched man that I am!"). The internal struggle:
    wanting good, doing evil. Our fallen nature needs divine power.
  - **(RQ)** Does Paul's raw description of inner conflict in Romans 7 resonate
    with your own experience sometimes? It shows our deep need.
- **Christ's Empathetic Help:**
  - Hebrews 2:18 - "For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is
    _able_ to aid those who are tempted." [Whiteboard: Heb 2:18 -> Jesus Tempted
    -> Understands -> Able to HELP].
  - **Brief Illustration:** Imagine trying to cross a dangerous mountain pass.
    Who would you trust more: someone who has only read maps, or an experienced
    guide who has navigated that very pass, knows the pitfalls, and successfully
    reached the other side? Christ is that experienced guide for us in
    temptation.
  - His help is not just sympathy, but imparted strength and wisdom because He
    conquered.
- **Prayer as Seeking Guidance & Deliverance (Connecting back to Matt 6:13):**
  - Matthew 6:13a - "And lead us not into temptation..." This is a prayer
    acknowledging our weakness and asking God to steer us away from situations
    too strong for us, or to give strength _in_ them.
  - Matthew 6:13b - "...but deliver us from evil (or the evil one)." This is the
    cry for rescue, relying on His power when temptation strikes.

### Section 3: Victory Through Active Reliance (12 min)

- **God's Faithful Provision:**
  - 1 Corinthians 10:13 - "No temptation has overtaken you except such as is
    common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted
    beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the _way of
    escape_, that you may be able to bear it." [Write on board: 1 Cor 10:13 =
    Temptation Common + God Faithful + Limit + Way of Escape].
  - **(RQ)** What does it mean that God provides a "way of escape"? Is it always
    removing the temptation, or sometimes strength _within_ it? (Discuss both
    possibilities).
  - `[Aside: The "way of escape" (Greek: ekbasis) literally means an 'exit' or a 'way out,' like finding a path out of a difficult situation. It implies God actively provides a solution we can take.]`
- **Our Active Role: Reckoning and Yielding:**
  - Romans 6:11-14 - "Likewise you also, _reckon_ yourselves to be dead indeed
    to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Therefore do not let sin
    reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts... but
    present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as
    instruments of righteousness to God. For sin shall not have dominion over
    you..."
  - **Brief Illustration:** "Reckoning" is like an accounting term. It means to
    count something as true and act on that basis. We are to count our old
    sinful allegiance as finished (paid for by Christ) and our new life in Him
    as our current reality. This isn't pretending; it's claiming the truth of
    our position in Christ. [Write on board: Rom 6:11 = Reckon/Count -> Dead to
    Sin -> Alive to God].
  - This requires a conscious choice to yield to God, not sin (v. 13). Prayer is
    key to this yielding.

### Conclusion & Application (6 min)

- **Recap:** We've seen temptation comes from our desires and Satan (James 1,
  Eph 6), but God doesn't tempt us. We are weak, but Christ understands and
  provides help (Heb 2). God always provides a way of escape (1 Cor 10:13), and
  victory comes through actively relying on Him, reckoning ourselves dead to sin
  and alive to God (Rom 6, Matt 6:13).
- **Application Framework:**
  - **Need (Identified from Text):** We all face temptation and often feel
    powerless against our desires and the enemy's schemes (James 1:14, Eph 6:12,
    Rom 7).
  - **Biblical Principle (From Text):** Victory over temptation comes not
    through self-effort alone, but through _active reliance_ on God's power,
    accessed through Christ who understands, provides escape, and enables us to
    live a new life (Matt 6:13, Heb 2:18, 1 Cor 10:13, Rom 6:11-14).
  - **Bridging (Connecting Text to Life):** The prayer "Lead us not into
    temptation, but deliver us from evil" isn't just words; it's the expression
    of this active reliance. It's our daily lifeline in the spiritual battle
    that continues today.
  - **Actionable Steps (Derived from Text):**
    1.  **Pray Immediately:** When temptation arises, instantly pray Matthew
        6:13: "Lord, lead me away or give me strength! Deliver me from the evil
        one!"
    2.  **Look for the Exit:** Actively look for the "way of escape" God
        promises (1 Cor 10:13) – changing the environment, calling a friend,
        focusing on Scripture, etc.
    3.  **Reckon Daily:** Start each day consciously "reckoning" yourself dead
        to sin and alive to God through Christ (Rom 6:11), choosing to yield
        your body and mind to Him.
- **Invitation:** Will you commit this week to practicing _active reliance_?
  When temptation comes, don't just fight it alone. Pray immediately, look for
  God's escape route, and consciously reckon on the power of Christ within you.
  Trust His promise to deliver.
