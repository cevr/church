### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- The World's Definition of Success vs. God's (Materialism, status vs.
  faithfulness, character)
- The Year Ahead: Opportunity for _true_ success.
- **Central Question:** What does God say is the key to genuine prosperity and
  success, not just for ancient Israel, but for us today? **(RQ)**
- Introduce Joshua 1 as a blueprint. `[Write on board: Title & Joshua 1:8]`

### Section 1: God's Definition of Success & Purpose (8 min)

- **Point:** Christian success means being obedient to God's will.
  - Contrast worldly success with biblical success (Joshua 1:7-8).
  - Success isn't automatic; it's conditional on obedience.
    `[Write on board: Success = Obedience to God's Will]`
- **Point:** God has a purpose for each life and church.
  - God's commission to Joshua (Joshua 1:2-4) - specific task, divine
    assignment.
  - God has plans for _us_ (Jeremiah 29:11). `[Read Jer 29:11]`
  - How do we discover this purpose? **(RQ)** Through relationship and His Word.
  - `[Write on board: God's Purpose (Jer 29:11) -> Discovered via Word/Prayer]`
- **Transition:** Understanding our purpose requires trusting the One who gives
  it.

### Section 2: The Foundation - Faith & God's Presence (10 min)

- **Point:** Faith in God's promises is essential.
  - God's promises to Joshua: Land, victory, presence (Joshua 1:3-5).
  - Requires _belief_ to act upon these promises.
  - Without faith, it's impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6).
    `[Read Heb 11:6]`
  - What does active faith look like when facing challenges? **(RQ)**
  - `[Write on board: Faith (Heb 11:6) = Trusting God's Promises]`
- **Point:** God assures believers of His constant presence.
  - "I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee." (Joshua 1:5).
  - "I will be with thee." (Joshua 1:9).
  - This promise is the antidote to fear. `[Read Matthew 28:20b]`
  - `[Analogy (from Josh 1:5): God's presence like a general always beside his soldier - assurance, guidance.]`
- **Transition:** God's presence empowers us for the challenges ahead.

### Section 3: The Path - Courage & Strict Obedience [*] (10 min)

- **Point:** Courage derived from God's power is necessary.
  - Command: "Be strong and of a good courage" (Joshua 1:6, 7, 9) - Repeated for
    emphasis!
  - Why was courage needed? **(RQ)** Facing enemies, new territory,
    responsibility.
  - Our source of courage isn't self-reliance, but God's presence and power
    (Joshua 1:9b).
    `[Write on board: Courage <- God's Presence & Power (Josh 1:9)]`
- **Point:** Strict obedience to God's Word is key.
  - The Condition: "Observe to do according to all the law... turn not from it
    to the right hand or to the left" (Joshua 1:7).
  - Not just knowing, but _doing_. Not partial obedience, but _all_.
    `[Emphasize 'all']`
  - Requires careful attention: "Meditate therein day and night" (Joshua 1:8).
  - `[Write on board: Obedience (Josh 1:7-8) -> Meditate -> Observe -> Do ALL]`
  - How easily do we turn aside slightly without realizing it? **(RQ)**
- **Point:** This leads to true success.
  - The Result: "that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest" (Joshua
    1:7); "make thy way prosperous... good success" (Joshua 1:8).
  - `[Aside: Like navigating with a perfect map (God's Word). Sticking to the route ensures reaching the destination; deviating leads to getting lost. True success is reaching God's intended destination for us.]`

### Section 4: The Walk - Holiness & Total Commitment (7 min)

- **Point:** Living a life of holiness is part of walking with God.
  - Obedience to God's law naturally leads to a separated life.
  - Called to be holy because He is holy (1 Peter 1:15-16).
    `[Read 1 Pet 1:15-16]`
  - Holiness isn't just rule-keeping, but reflecting God's character, enabled by
    His grace.
    `[Write on board: Holiness (1 Pet 1:15-16) = Reflecting God's Character]`
  - Is my daily life aligning with God's call to holiness? **(RQ)**
- **Point:** Total commitment and surrender of one's will is required.
  - Presenting ourselves as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1-2).
    `[Read Rom 12:1-2]`
  - Not conforming to the world, but being transformed.
  - This involves surrendering _our_ plans for success to embrace _His_.
  - `[Write on board: Commitment (Rom 12:1-2) = Surrendered Will -> Transformed Life]`
  - `[Brief Concept (from Rom 12:1): Like giving God a blank check with our life - trusting Him to fill it according to His perfect will.]`

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Recap:** True success isn't found in worldly formulas, but in God's
  unchanging principles derived from His Word:
  - Understanding His Purpose (Jer 29:11)
  - Living by Faith in His Presence (Heb 11:6, Josh 1:5, 9)
  - Walking in Courageous Obedience to His Word (Josh 1:7-8)
  - Pursuing Holiness through Total Commitment (1 Pet 1:15-16, Rom 12:1-2)
- The promise of Joshua 1:8 is still valid. God promises prosperity and success
  to those who diligently follow His Word.
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from Scripture):**
  1.  **Meditate Daily:** Commit to spending time each day meditating on God's
      Word, letting it shape your thoughts and actions (Joshua 1:8).
      `[Suggest specific time, e.g., 15 min]`
  2.  **Obey Courageously:** Identify one specific area where God is calling you
      to obey His Word this week, even if it feels difficult or requires courage
      (Joshua 1:7, 9).
  3.  **Surrender & Trust:** Practice surrendering your plans daily in prayer,
      asking God for His guidance and consciously relying on His promised
      presence (Rom 12:1-2, Josh 1:5).
- **Final Question:** Are you willing to commit fully to God's definition of
  success, trusting His Word and His presence above all else? **(RQ)**
- **Invitation:** Invitation to prayer, committing our definition of success to
  God, seeking His guidance through His Word daily, and taking these steps.
- Closing Prayer.
