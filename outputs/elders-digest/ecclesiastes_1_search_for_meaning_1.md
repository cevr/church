### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce Book: Ecclesiastes - The Preacher's (Qoheleth) reflections.
- Solomon's Quest: Using God-given advantages (wisdom, resources) to find
  meaning "under the sun."
- Define "Under the Sun": Earthly perspective, life viewed apart from God's
  eternal plan. `[Whiteboard: "Under the Sun" = Earthly Viewpoint (Limited)]`
- Central Question: Can human effort, even guided by great wisdom, achieve
  lasting satisfaction on its own? **(RQ)**

### Section 1: The Unchanging Cycle (10 min)

- **Biblical Foundation:** Read Ecclesiastes 1:4-11.
- **Observation 1: Permanence vs. Transience (v. 4):** Generations come and go,
  the earth remains.
  `[Whiteboard: Generations Pass <-> Earth Abides (Eccl 1:4)]`
- **Observation 2: Nature's Repetition (vv. 5-7):** Sun rises/sets, wind whirls,
  rivers flow to the sea but it's never full. Constant motion, returning to the
  start.
- **Observation 3: Human Experience (v. 8):** Labor leads to weariness. Senses
  are never fully satisfied. What does this imply about earthly pursuits?
  **(RQ)**
- **Core Idea: "Nothing New" (vv. 9-11):** What has been, will be. History
  repeats, but is often forgotten.
  `[Write Question on Board: How does Eccl 1:9 challenge our idea of progress?]`
  **(RQ)**
- **Feeling:** This perspective evokes a sense of futility _if_ this is all
  there is.

### Section 2: Solomon's Wise Investigation (12 min)

- **Biblical Foundation:** Read Ecclesiastes 1:12-13, 17-18.
- **Solomon's Authority:** King in Jerusalem, uniquely gifted with wisdom (Ref 1
  Kings 3:12).
- **His God-Given Task (v. 13):** "To search and seek out by wisdom concerning
  all things that are done under heaven."
  `[Whiteboard: Solomon's Task (Eccl 1:13) -> Explore Life via Wisdom]`
- **Nature of the Task:** A "sore travail" (difficult burden) God gave humanity.
  Why might God assign such a task? **(RQ)** (Perhaps to reveal its inherent
  limitations).
- **Scope of Investigation (v. 17):** Applied his heart/mind to know wisdom, but
  also madness and folly.
- **The Startling Conclusion (vv. 17b-18):** Realized this pursuit was "vexation
  of spirit" (grasping at wind). Increased wisdom/knowledge led to increased
  grief/sorrow.
  `[Whiteboard: Human Wisdom (Alone) -> Vexation + Sorrow (Eccl 1:17-18)]`
- **Why Grief? (RQ):** Human wisdom, isolated from God, diagnoses problems it
  cannot solve, reveals brokenness without offering redemption. It sees the
  effects of sin without the cure.
- [Aside: It's like diagnosing a disease perfectly but having no cure. The
  knowledge increases the burden if it doesn't lead to the Healer.]

### Section 3: Two Kinds of Wisdom [*] (12 min)

- **Distinction is Key:** Solomon's experiment wasn't against wisdom itself, but
  wisdom pursued _apart from God's ultimate purpose_.
- **Futile Wisdom ("Under the Sun"):** Human intellect, philosophy, knowledge
  operating independently of divine revelation. Can analyze, but not provide
  ultimate meaning or salvation (Ref Eccl 1:18).
- **Beneficial Wisdom (God-Given):** Begins with reverence for God (Prov 9:10).
  Aligns with His character and will.
  - **Source & Benefit:** Read Proverbs 2:1-9. Seeking God yields His wisdom,
    leading to understanding, righteousness, justice, equity, and protection.
    `[Whiteboard: God's Wisdom (Prov 2:6) -> Understanding | Righteousness | Protection]`
  - **How to Obtain:** Read James 1:5. Ask God sincerely; He gives generously.
    `[Whiteboard: Need Wisdom? -> Ask God (James 1:5)]`
- **The Ultimate Wisdom - Christ:**
  - **Focus Shift:** Read 1 Corinthians 1:30-31. God's solution isn't just
    principles, but a Person. Christ _is_ our wisdom, righteousness,
    sanctification, redemption.
    `[Whiteboard: CHRIST = Our Wisdom, Righteousness... (1 Cor 1:30)]`
  - **Divine Solution:** Human wisdom failed to bridge the gap caused by sin;
    God provided Wisdom Incarnate.
  - [Analogy (from 1 Cor 1): Human wisdom is like trying to build a tower to
    heaven (Babel); Christ is God's ladder reaching down to us.]
- **Practical Application Framework:**
  - **Need:** We crave meaning in a world that often feels repetitive and
    unsatisfying (Ref Eccl 1:8).
  - **Biblical Principle:** True, life-giving wisdom originates with God and is
    fully embodied in Christ (Prov 2:6, 1 Cor 1:30).
  - **Bridging:** Relying solely on worldly knowledge or human reasoning for
    ultimate answers leads to the frustration Solomon found (Eccl 1:18).
  - **Action Steps:** `[Whiteboard: Action Steps]`
    1.  Humbly acknowledge the limits of human wisdom apart from God (Eccl
        1:18).
    2.  Intentionally seek God's wisdom daily through prayer (James 1:5) and
        study of His Word (Prov 2:1-5).
    3.  Center your life on knowing Jesus Christ, the true Wisdom of God (1 Cor
        1:30).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap Solomon's Findings:** The wisest man, using human wisdom to analyze
  life "under the sun," found it ultimately unsatisfying – like chasing the wind
  (Eccl 1:17-18).
- **The Cycle Breaker:** The seemingly meaningless cycles of life (Eccl 1:4-11)
  find purpose only through an eternal perspective centered in Christ.
- **True Wisdom Defined:** Not just accumulating facts, but knowing God through
  Jesus Christ (1 Cor 1:30). He provides the meaning human wisdom cannot.
- [Aside: Our modern information age bombards us with knowledge, yet deep
  satisfaction remains elusive for many. It echoes Solomon's discovery:
  knowledge isn't the same as wisdom, and worldly wisdom isn't the same as peace
  with God.]
- **Gentle Invitation:** Are you weary of chasing the wind? Are you relying on
  human understanding alone? Choose today to seek the true, lasting wisdom found
  only in Jesus Christ. Ask God for His wisdom (James 1:5).
- **Closing Prayer**
