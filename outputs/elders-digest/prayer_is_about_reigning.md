### Introduction (6 min)

- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the Lord's Prayer (Matt 6:9-13) - A model for relating to God, given
  by Christ Himself.
- Focus: The profound petition - "Thy kingdom come." (Matt 6:10a)
  - (RQ) What are we _really_ asking for when we pray this? Is it just about the
    future?
- Study Aim: To explore how this prayer positions us not just as petitioners,
  but as active participants (1 Cor 3:9 - workers together with God) in God's
  reign – prophetically, personally, and practically.

### Main Content 1: The Prophetic Kingdom (11 min)

- **Understanding the Petition:** "Thy kingdom come" is primarily a plea for God
  to establish His promised, future, literal kingdom (Titus 2:13 - looking for
  that blessed hope).
  - It acknowledges God's ultimate sovereignty (Ps 103:19 - His kingdom ruleth
    over all) and His plan to restore all things (Rev 21:1-5).
- **Contrast with Earthly Kingdoms:**
  - Current world under sin's influence (2 Cor 4:4 - the god of this world hath
    blinded the minds; Rom 8:22 - the whole creation groaneth).
  - [Whiteboard: Earthly Kingdoms (Temporary, Sinful - Rom 8:22) vs. God's
    Kingdom (Eternal, Righteous - Dan 2:44)]
- **Biblical Foundation for the Future Kingdom:**
  - Isaiah 9:6-7: Prophecy of Christ's eternal government upon His shoulder.
  - Daniel 2:44: God's kingdom will destroy all others and stand forever. [Write
    on board: Dan 2:44 - Indestructible Kingdom]
  - Luke 1:32-33: Angel's promise to Mary about Jesus' eternal throne of David.
  - Matthew 25:31: Son of Man coming in glory to sit on His throne of glory.
  - Revelation 11:15: The kingdoms of this world _become_ the kingdoms of our
    Lord and of His Christ.
  - (RQ) How does focusing on this future reality (Col 3:1-2 - Set your
    affection on things above) impact our present perspective and priorities?

### Main Content 2: The Personal Kingdom [*] (13 min)

- **Shifting Focus: The Kingdom Within:** While looking forward, "Thy kingdom
  come" is also deeply personal, echoing Christ's teaching (Luke 17:21 - behold,
  the kingdom of God is within you).
  - It's praying for God's rule and reign – His righteousness, peace, and joy in
    the Holy Ghost (Rom 14:17) – to be fully realized _in our own lives, right
    now_.
  - [Whiteboard: Thy Kingdom Come -> In My Heart (Luke 17:21)]
- **Enthroning God:**
  - Requires conscious submission to His will, demonstrated by obedience (John
    14:15 - If ye love me, keep my commandments).
  - Means dethroning self-will, pride, and Satan's influence, crucifying the
    flesh (Gal 5:24 - they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh). [Draw
    simple diagram: Heart with 'Self' on throne crossed out, replaced by
    'Christ' (Gal 2:20)]
  - (RQ) What areas of our lives (thoughts, habits, relationships) are we
    hesitant to fully surrender to Christ's reign (James 4:7)?
- **Citizenship Now:**
  - Believers are _already_ citizens of God's spiritual kingdom (Phil 3:20 - Our
    citizenship [conversation] is in heaven).
  - [Write on board: Phil 3:20 - Heavenly Citizenship]
  - This citizenship demands a corresponding lifestyle – living by the laws and
    values of heaven _today_ (Eph 4:1 - walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye
    are called).
  - (RQ) How does a citizen of heaven (Phil 3:20) behave differently in a fallen
    world (1 Pet 2:11-12)?
  - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our lives and homes should reflect the
    values of the kingdom we represent (Matt 5:16), offering a glimpse of
    heaven's culture amidst earthly customs.

### Main Content 3: The Practical Kingdom (10 min)

- **Connecting Personal Reign to Global Advance:** Praying "Thy kingdom come"
  expresses a desire to see God's work, Word, and will advance _in the world_
  (Matt 24:14 - this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world).
  - It's not passive waiting, but active participation, abounding in the work of
    the Lord (1 Cor 15:58).
- **How We Advance His Kingdom:**
  - **1. Prayer:** Foundational – aligning our desires with God's purpose and
    will (Matt 6:10b - Thy will be done...).
  - **2. Submission & Yielding:** Allowing Christ to live His life through us is
    the primary means of kingdom demonstration.
    - Galatians 2:20: "Not I, but Christ liveth in me." [Whiteboard: Gal 2:20 =
      Kingdom Living]
    - Ephesians 2:10: We are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
      works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.
    - [Analogy (from Eph 2:10): Like skilled artisans using prepared tools, God
      uses yielded lives (Rom 6:13) to build His kingdom.]
    - (RQ) How does daily surrender (Luke 9:23) empower us for kingdom work?
  - **3. Outreach & Witness:** Spreading the Gospel message – the good news of
    the King and His kingdom – is the commission.
    - Mark 16:15: Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
      creature.
    - Matthew 28:19-20: Go ye therefore, and teach [make disciples of] all
      nations...
    - Acts 1:8: But ye shall receive power... and ye shall be witnesses unto
      me...
    - [Whiteboard: Prayer (Matt 6:10) -> Submission (Gal 2:20) -> Outreach (Mark
      16:15) = Advancing the Kingdom]
    - [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Every interaction, every
      resource, when submitted to God (1 Cor 10:31), can become an instrument to
      demonstrate His love and draw others towards His reign.

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** Praying "Thy kingdom come" (Matt 6:10a) is a powerful act
  encompassing:
  - Hope in God's **prophetic** promise (Future Kingdom - Dan 2:44).
  - Commitment to God's **personal** reign (Kingdom Within - Luke 17:21).
  - Engagement in God's **practical** work (Kingdom Advance - Mark 16:15).
- **The Core Invitation:** Are we truly praying for God's kingdom to come _in
  us_ (Gal 2:20) before it comes _around us_?
  - Requires daily dethroning of self (Gal 5:24) and enthroning of Christ (Col
    3:15 - let the peace of God rule...).
- **Actionable Step:** This week, consciously pray "Thy kingdom come" focusing
  on one specific area where you need to submit more fully to His reign (James
  4:7). Ask God how you can practically advance His kingdom through yieldedness
  (Rom 6:13) and witness (Acts 1:8) in your sphere of influence.
- **Final Encouragement:** As we live as faithful citizens (Phil 3:20),
  submitting to our King (John 14:15) and sharing His message (Mark 16:15), we
  participate in answering our own prayer, hastening the day of His glorious
  return (2 Peter 3:12).
- Closing Prayer: Focus on surrender (Rom 12:1-2), asking for grace to live as
  kingdom citizens and advance His reign daily.
