### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** Our approach to giving and finances is a powerful indicator of our trust in God, our love for Him, and our understanding of His ownership (Matt 6:21).
-   **Recap Core Truths:** God owns all; we are stewards accountable for faithfulness; giving flows from love (Tithe + Offerings); faithfulness brings blessing.
