### Introduction (5 min)

- Start with a universal observation: Prayer is common across many beliefs, but
  what does _biblical_ prayer look like?
- Introduce the core tension: Is prayer a performance or a personal connection?
- State the study's purpose: To explore Jesus' teaching on authentic prayer,
  free from pretense, based primarily on Matthew 6.
- Central Idea: True prayer is about sincere communion with our Father, not
  impressing others (Matt 6:6).
- **(RQ)** How can we ensure our prayers are genuine conversations with God, not
  just religious exercises?

### Section 1: The Privilege & Peril of Prayer (10 min)

- **The Supreme Privilege:**
  - Read Hebrews 4:16 - Direct access to God's throne.
  - `[Whiteboard: Heb 4:16 -> Bold Access -> Throne of Grace]`
  - Explain: Because of Christ, we can approach God directly, confidently,
    seeking mercy and grace.
  - **(RQ)** Do we truly grasp the magnitude of this privilege – speaking
    directly to the Creator?
- **The Peril of Pretense:**
  - Read Matthew 6:5 - Jesus' warning against hypocritical prayer.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 6:5 -> Hypocrisy = Praying to be SEEN by men]`
  - Define hypocrisy in this context: Acting a part, seeking human applause
    rather than divine connection.
  - **(RQ)** Why is praying 'to be seen' so offensive to God according to this
    verse?
  - Discuss the 'reward' they receive (human praise) vs. the reward they forfeit
    (God's answer/blessing).
  - `[Aside: Our motives reveal who our true audience is. If we crave human notice more than God's attention, our spiritual compass is broken. Prayer re-calibrates it.]`

### Section 2: The Pattern for Genuine Prayer (12 min) [*]

- **The Place of Prayer:**
  - Read Matthew 6:6 - The call to private prayer.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 6:6 -> Closet Prayer = Secret, Sincere Communion]`
  - Emphasize: Not condemning public prayer, but stressing the _foundation_ of
    personal, private relationship with the Father.
  - Focus on 'Father which is in secret' - intimacy, relationship.
  - **(RQ)** What does 'entering the closet' symbolize for our prayer life
    today, beyond a literal room?
- **The Manner of Prayer:**
  - Read Matthew 6:7 - Warning against 'vain repetitions'.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 6:7 -> NO Vain Repetitions (like the heathen)]`
  - Explain: God isn't swayed by the _quantity_ or _eloquence_ of words, but the
    _sincerity_ of the heart. Contrast with pagan rituals designed to manipulate
    deities.
  - **(RQ)** How can we avoid falling into repetitive prayer habits that lose
    their meaning?
- **The Knowledge of God:**
  - Read Matthew 6:8 - Our Father knows our needs.
  - `[Whiteboard: Matt 6:8 -> Father KNOWS Needs BEFORE we ask]`
  - Explain: Prayer isn't informing God, but aligning ourselves with His will,
    expressing dependence, and deepening relationship.
  - `[Brief Analogy (from verse 8): Like a child talking to a loving parent – the conversation matters more than just listing demands the parent already knows.]`
  - This knowledge should lead to trust, not prayerlessness.

### Section 3: The Posture of Effective Prayer (12 min)

- **The Necessity of Faith:**
  - Read Hebrews 11:6 - Impossible to please God without faith.
  - `[Whiteboard: Heb 11:6 -> Faith = Believing God IS + He REWARDS seekers]`
  - Explain: Faith isn't just belief _that_ God exists, but trust _in_ His
    character and promises. It's the foundation upon which prayer rests.
  - **(RQ)** How does genuine faith, as described here, combat pretense in
    prayer?
- **Asking Without Doubting:**
  - Read James 1:5-8 - Ask for wisdom in faith, without wavering.
  - `[Whiteboard: James 1:5-8 -> Ask in Faith -> No Wavering (like the sea)]`
  - Explain 'wavering': Double-mindedness, torn between trusting God and relying
    on self/world.
  - Connect lack of faith/wavering to unanswered prayer (v. 7).
  - `[Aside: Faith isn't demanding our will, but trusting God's wisdom even when we don't understand. It's like holding onto an anchor in a storm – the anchor (God's faithfulness) holds us, not our perfect grip.]`
- **The Heart of Prayer: Sincerity & Humility:**
  - Synthesize: True prayer (Matt 6:6) requires the faith (Heb 11:6) and
    unwavering trust (James 1:5-8) that flows from humility, not the prideful
    pretense seeking human approval (Matt 6:5).
  - `[Whiteboard: Authentic Prayer = Humility + Sincerity + Faith]`
  - **(RQ)** Based on these texts, what practical steps can we take to cultivate
    sincerity and humility in our prayer lives?

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Recap the contrast: Prayer as performance (Matt 6:5) vs. Prayer
  as privileged communion (Heb 4:16, Matt 6:6).
- Reiterate Key Principles: Pray privately/sincerely (Matt 6:6), avoid
  meaningless repetition (Matt 6:7), trust the Father who knows (Matt 6:8), and
  approach with faith (Heb 11:6, James 1:5-8).
- **The Core Message:** God desires relationship, not ritual. He seeks authentic
  hearts, not actors.
- **Practical Application Review:**
  - **Need:** Tendency towards ritual or seeking approval.
  - **Principle:** God values secret, sincere, faith-filled prayer (Matt 6:6,
    Heb 11:6).
  - **Practice:** Dedicate specific time for private prayer; focus on honesty
    with God; consciously reject thoughts of 'how this sounds' to others.
  - **Action Steps:** 1. Find a consistent private place/time this week. 2.
    Before praying, consciously affirm belief in God's presence and care (Heb
    11:6). 3. Practice honesty – tell God your real struggles and needs simply
    (Matt 6:8).
- **Gentle Invitation:** Encourage a commitment to move away from any form of
  pretense and embrace the joy and power of authentic, secret communion with the
  Father who sees and rewards.
