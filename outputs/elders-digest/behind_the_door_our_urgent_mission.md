### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: What lies "Behind the Door"? (Metaphor: Closing opportunity/probation).
- Central Truth: The Gospel must go to the world _before_ the end (Matt 24:14).
  - [Whiteboard: Title - "Behind the Door: Our Urgent Mission"]
  - [Whiteboard: Matt 24:14 - Gospel -> All Nations -> END]
- Purpose: Understand the _urgency_ and _power_ of the Advent message _now_.
- (RQ) Are we living as if we truly believe this commission and timeline?

### Section 1: The Closing Window of Opportunity (10 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Why the urgency? Is time running out?
- **Biblical Principle:** Probation's door is closing.
  - Strive to Enter Now (Luke 13:24-25): Opportunity is limited. [Whiteboard:
    Probation -> Limited Opportunity (Luke 13:24)]
  - (RQ) What does 'striving' look like practically in light of this verse?
- **Biblical Principle:** Signs confirm the lateness of the hour.
  - Prophetic Markers (Matt 24:3-14; cf. 2 Thess 2:3-4): Wars, natural
    disasters, deception, rise of lawlessness, papal resurgence, ecumenism,
    spiritualism â€“ _as described in Scripture_. [Whiteboard: Signs (Matt 24) ->
    Confirm Urgency]
  - (RQ) Seeing these biblical signs, how should this affect our daily
    priorities?
- **Biblical Principle:** Choices become final.
  - The Final Declaration (Rev 22:11-12): Character solidified before Christ's
    return. [Write on board: Rev 22:11-12 -> Finality]
  - [Aside: Like Noah building the ark amidst scoffing, our call is to proclaim
    truth regardless of immediate reception, knowing the storm described in
    God's Word is coming.]
- **Bridging to Practice:** These verses aren't just history/future; they demand
  present action.

### Section 2: The Power Within the Message [*] (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Can our message truly solve today's deep problems (sin,
  brokenness, hopelessness)?
- **Biblical Principle:** The Gospel _is_ God's Power (Rom 1:16).
  - Not just words, but divine power for salvation/transformation. [Whiteboard:
    Gospel (Rom 1:16) = POWER unto Salvation]
  - Addresses the root: Sin (cf. Rom 3:23).
- **Biblical Principle:** God's Word is Alive and Active (Heb 4:12).
  - It discerns, convicts, and heals. [Whiteboard: Word (Heb 4:12) -> Pierces &
    Heals]
  - (RQ) Have we personally experienced the life-changing power described in
    Hebrews 4:12?
- **Bridging to Practice:** This power transforms lives _today_.
  - Examples (derived from Heb 4:12's power): Sobering the intemperate, mending
    minds, saving marriages, giving hope/peace (cf. 2 Cor 5:17 - new creation).
  - [Brief Illustration Concept (from Heb 4:12): God's Word like a surgeon's
    scalpel - precisely targets the 'disease' of sin revealed in Scripture,
    enabling true healing and restoration.]
- **Actionable Steps (Implied):** Believe in the message's power; share it
  expecting transformation.

### Section 3: Our Mandate to Act (12 min)

- **The Need/Question:** Knowing the urgency and power, what is our specific
  responsibility?
- **Biblical Principle:** We are Commanded to Go (Mark 16:15; Acts 1:8).
  - Universal scope: "All the world," "every creature." [Whiteboard: Command:
    GO! (Mark 16:15)]
  - Divine Enablement: Power comes from the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8). [Whiteboard:
    Power: Spirit (Acts 1:8)]
  - (RQ) Based on Mark 16:15, where is _our_ 'world' that needs the gospel?
- **Biblical Principle:** Faith Overcomes Obstacles (1 John 5:4; Phil 4:13).
  - Fear, doubt, lack of resources are real challenges mentioned implicitly or
    explicitly in scripture (e.g., disciples' fear), but faith in God is the
    solution. [Whiteboard: Faith (1 John 5:4) -> Overcomes World/Obstacles]
  - (RQ) How can we apply Philippians 4:13 when facing evangelism challenges?
  - [Aside: Instead of focusing on the closed doors of difficulty, faith, as
    seen in biblical accounts, looks for the windows of opportunity God always
    provides, even if they seem small, like the widow's two mites.]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Move from knowing to doing.
  - Set Faith-Filled Goals: Aim based on God's power (Phil 4:13), not human
    limitations or past results.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - 1. Personal Consecration: Deepen reliance on God (Prayer, Bible Study -
       foundation for Acts 1:8 power).
  - 2. Identify Your Sphere: Where can _you_ witness _this week_ based on Mark
       16:15's call?
  - 3. Use Your Means: What God-given tools/talents can you employ (literature,
       digital, conversation, acts of service reflecting Christ)? [Whiteboard:
       Action Steps: 1. Consecrate 2. Identify Sphere 3. Use Means]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:**
  - The Door is Closing (Luke 13:25, Rev 22:11-12).
  - The Signs are Clear (Matt 24).
  - The Message Has Power (Rom 1:16, Heb 4:12).
  - The Command is Urgent (Mark 16:15).
- **Reiterate Central Verse:** Our role in fulfilling Matthew 24:14.
- **Final Question:** Will we stand faithfully "Behind the Door," ready to share
  the life-saving message found in Scripture before probation closes? Will we
  act in faith (1 John 5:4)?
- **Invitation:** Commit _today_ to personal revival and finding _one specific
  way_ to actively share the Advent message this week, trusting in God's power.
