### Introduction (5 min)
*   Begin with the universal human experience of longing, searching, inner 'thirst'.
*   Introduce Psalm 42:2 as the cry of the soul for its source.
*   [Write on board: Psalm 42:2 - Soul Thirst -> Living God]
*   State Aim: To explore this God-given thirst, what blocks its fulfillment, God's amazing provision, and the profound implications of understanding our value to Him.
*   Why does the Psalmist specify the *living* God? **(RQ)**

### Section 1: The Soul's Thirst - Designed for God (10 min)
*   **The Need (Ps 42:2a):** "My soul thirsteth for God..." - This is foundational to our being.
*   **Biblical Principle (Gen 1:26-27):** We are *designed* for fellowship.
    *   Created in God's image - implies capacity for relationship, communication, reflecting His character.
    *   [Whiteboard: Gen 1:26-27 -> Image of God = Designed for Fellowship]
    *   Designed to Walk, Wait, and Work with God.
        *   Psalm 145:18 (The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him). God desires closeness.
        *   1 Cor 3:9 (Labourers together with God). Partnership in purpose.
*   **Bridging to Practice:** This innate thirst is real, but often misdirected. **(RQ)** Where do people today try to quench this deep soul-thirst apart from the 'living God'? (e.g., possessions, status, relationships, entertainment).
*   [Write Question on board: Are we trying to satisfy soul-thirst with broken cisterns? (cf. Jer 2:13)]

### Section 2: The Dryness - Separation Through Sin [*] (8 min)
*   **The Question (Ps 42:2b):** "...when shall I come and appear before God?" - Implies a distance, a barrier.
*   **Biblical Principle (Isa 59:2):** Sin is the great separator.
    *   "Your iniquities have separated between you and your God..." [Whiteboard: Sin (Isa 59:2) => Separation]
    *   Prov 21:16: Wandering from the way of understanding (God's way) leads to the 'congregation of the dead' - spiritual separation.
    *   2 Tim 4:10: Demas 'loved this present world'. Worldliness creates distance. How does prioritizing the temporal over the eternal create a barrier to fellowship with God? **(RQ)**
*   **Bridging to Practice:** Recognizing the sources of our spiritual dryness.
    *   [Aside: Like trying to drink saltwater, worldly pursuits promise satisfaction but ultimately increase spiritual dehydration and distance from the fresh water source.]
*   **Actionable Step:** Honest self-examination: What 'iniquities' or 'loves of this present world' might be hindering my closeness with God? (Based on Isa 59:2, 2 Tim 4:10).

### Section 3: The Living Water - God's Gracious Cure (10 min)
*   **The Need:** The separated, thirsty soul needs a remedy.
*   **Biblical Solution (God's Initiative):** God doesn't leave us thirsty.
    *   **God's Invitation (Isa 55:1):** "Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters... buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price." God freely offers satisfaction.
        *   [Whiteboard: God's Invitation (Isa 55:1) -> COME & DRINK FREELY]
    *   **Soul's Response (Matt 5:6):** "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled." Our part is recognizing the need and desiring the right thing – God's righteousness.
        *   What does it mean to *hunger and thirst* for righteousness in a practical sense? **(RQ)** [Analogy (from text): Like vital physical hunger/thirst, it's a deep, driving need for spiritual sustenance found only in Christ.]
    *   **Personal Appropriation (Rev 22:17):** "...let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." It requires a personal choice to accept and 'drink'.
        *   [Whiteboard: Our Choice (Rev 22:17) -> TAKE the Water of Life]
*   **Bridging to Practice:** God has provided the well (Christ), invited us, but we must choose to drink daily through prayer, study, obedience.

### Section 4: The Infinite Value - Calvary's Proof & Our Response (7 min)
*   **The Question:** How much does God want to quench our thirst? How valuable are we to Him?
*   **Biblical Principle (Calvary's Proof):** The Cross demonstrates infinite value.
    *   **John 3:16:** "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son..." The ultimate price paid.
    *   [Whiteboard: Cross (John 3:16) = Infinite Soul Value]
    *   1 Peter 1:18-19: Redeemed not with silver/gold, but the *precious* blood of Christ. Emphasizes immeasurable worth.
*   **Bridging to Practice:** Understanding this value transforms our perspective.
    *   **(RQ)** How does truly grasping your value, based on the price paid at Calvary (John 3:16, 1 Pet 1:18-19), change how you view yourself, your struggles, and your potential?
    *   [Aside: Our self-worth isn't based on performance or worldly status, but on the price Christ paid. It's like owning a priceless artifact – its value is inherent, declared by the one who acquired it at great cost.]
*   **Actionable Response (Motivation):** This truth fuels:
    *   **Character Building:** Living in a way that reflects our high calling and value in Christ (cf. Eph 4:1). [Whiteboard: Soul Value -> Character Building]
    *   **Evangelism:** Recognizing the infinite value of *every* soul compels us to share the life-giving Water with others who are thirsty (cf. Matt 28:19-20). [Whiteboard: Soul Value -> Evangelism]

### Conclusion: Quenching the Thirst - Living Our Worth (5 min)
*   **Summary:** We are made with a deep thirst only God can quench (Ps 42:2). Sin creates separation (Isa 59:2), but God graciously invites us to drink freely through Christ (Isa 55:1, Rev 22:17). Calvary is the undeniable proof of our infinite worth to Him (John 3:16).
*   **Final Question:** Knowing this, how will you intentionally 'come and appear before God' this week to satisfy your soul's thirst? **(RQ)**
*   **Invitation:** Choose daily to drink deeply from the Water of Life – His Word, His presence, His Spirit. Let the reality of your value in His eyes motivate a life of growing Christlikeness and sharing His invitation with a thirsty world.
*   Pray for commitment to seek God first.
