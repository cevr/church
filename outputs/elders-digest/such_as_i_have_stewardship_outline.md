### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Start with a brief scenario or question about feeling inadequate due
  to lack of material resources for God's work. (RQ) Have you ever felt you had
  nothing significant to offer?
- **Context:** Briefly set the scene of Acts 3:1-10 – Peter and John at the
  Temple gate Beautiful, the lame man's expectation.
- **Introduce Central Verse:** Focus on Peter's pivotal statement in Acts 3:6.
  [Write on board: Acts 3:6 - "Such as I have..."]
- **Study Aim:** We will explore biblical stewardship, understanding it
  encompasses _all_ God entrusts to us – empowered by His Spirit.
- [Write on board: Title - "Such As I Have"]

### Section 1: The Power We Possess (Acts 3) (10 min)

- **The Encounter (Acts 3:1-5):**
  - The Need: A man lame from birth, seeking alms.
  - The Disciples' Situation: No silver or gold.
- **The Declaration (Acts 3:6):**
  - Rejection of worldly means: "Silver and gold have I none..."
  - Assertion of Spiritual Power: "...but such as I have give I thee: In the
    name of Jesus Christ..."
  - [Write on board: Acts 3:6 -> Power of Jesus / Holy Spirit > Money]
- **The Source of Power:**
  - Not inherent in Peter, but derived from Christ through the Holy Spirit (Acts
    1:8, Acts 2 - Pentecost).
  - This power is for witness and service.
- **Biblical Principle:** God's primary provision for service is His Spirit's
  power, not material wealth.
  - (RQ) What spiritual resources, empowered by the Spirit (like Peter's faith
    and authority in Christ's name), do we possess today? (Ref Gal 5:22-23, 1
    Cor 12:4-11)
- **Bridging to Practice:** We often limit our view of resources to the
  material. God calls us to recognize and utilize the spiritual power He
  provides.

### Section 2: Stewardship of All Gifts [*] (12 min)

- **Defining Stewardship:**
  - More than money management; it's managing _all_ God-given resources
    according to His will.
  - [Write on board: Stewardship = Faithfully Managing God's Resources]
- **Identifying Our Resources:**
  - Spiritual Gifts (1 Cor 12): Teaching, serving, encouraging, etc.
  - Talents & Abilities: Skills, knowledge, experience.
  - Time: How we allocate our hours and days.
  - Influence: Relationships, reputation, opportunities.
  - Health & Energy.
  - Testimony: Our personal experience with God.
- **The Mandate to Use Gifts (1 Peter 4:10):**
  - "As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to
    another..."
  - We are stewards of God's _manifold grace_.
  - [Write on board: 1 Peter 4:10 -> Use YOUR gift for OTHERS]
  - (RQ) How can you specifically use one of your non-financial resources (time,
    skill, influence) to minister this week?
- **The Principle of Faithfulness (Matthew 25:14-30):**
  - Parable of Talents: Focus is on _using_ what was entrusted, regardless of
    amount.
  - Condemnation for _inactivity_ and fear (burying the talent).
  - [Write on board: Matt 25 -> Use it or Lose it! Faithfulness > Amount]
  - Key Lesson: Don't wait for perceived 'greater' opportunities or resources.
    Be faithful with what you have _now_.
  - [Aside: Like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly
    system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Small opportunities,
    faithfully used, yield great results.]

### Section 3: Financial Faithfulness & Lifestyle Commitment (12 min)

- **Acknowledging God's Ownership (Finance):**
  - Tithe (Malachi 3:10): Returning God's tenth is an act of worship, obedience,
    and trust.
  - [Write on board: Mal 3:10 -> Tithe = Test of Trust & Partnership]
  - Offerings (2 Corinthians 9:6-8): Given cheerfully, purposefully,
    proportionally, out of gratitude for God's grace.
  - [Write on board: 2 Cor 9:7 -> Giving: Cheerful & Purposeful]
- **The Motivation for Giving (2 Corinthians 8:9):**
  - Christ's example: His sacrifice motivates our generosity.
  - (RQ) How does reflecting on Christ becoming poor for us impact our
    willingness to give sacrificially?
- **The 'Both/And' Principle:**
  - True stewardship integrates _both_ faithful financial management _and_ the
    dedication of all other gifts and resources.
  - It's not choosing one over the other.
- **Lifestyle as Stewardship (Romans 12:1-2):**
  - "Present your bodies a living sacrifice..."
  - This encompasses our daily choices, health habits, use of time, media
    consumption, relationships – all dedicated to God.
  - [Write on board: Rom 12:1-2 = Total Life Stewardship]
  - [Analogy (from Rom 12): Our lives are like musical instruments; dedicated
    stewardship means keeping them tuned and ready for the Master's use.]
  - [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... They are
    like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of
    heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Our lives should
    similarly reflect heaven's principles.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Peter lacked money but gave what he had – the power of Christ.
  Biblical stewardship calls us to do the same with _all_ God has given us:
  Spirit's power, gifts, time, talents, influence, _and_ finances.
- **Revisit Central Truth (Acts 3:6):** The most valuable resource we possess is
  the power and presence of Jesus Christ through His Spirit.
- **The Need/Question:** What holds you back from fully utilizing _all_ God has
  given you?
- **Action Step Challenge:** Identify one specific resource (beyond money) you
  possess. How will you intentionally use it for God's service this week,
  relying on His Spirit? [Write Question on board: What "such as I have" will
  YOU give this week? (Acts 3:6)]
- **Connection to Larger Picture:** Faithful stewardship in _all_ areas reflects
  Christ's character, demonstrates readiness for His return, and participates in
  His restorative work.
- **Final Invitation:** Commit today to be a faithful steward of _everything_
  God has entrusted to you. Offer a prayer of dedication, asking for the Holy
  Spirit's empowerment to use
