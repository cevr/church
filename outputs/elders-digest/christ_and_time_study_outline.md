### Introduction (5 min)

-   Human experience of time: Linear, finite, often feels controlling.
-   Contrast with God's perspective: Eternal, outside of time's constraints (Psalm 90:2, 4).
-   Introduce Jesus: The unique intersection of eternity and time.
-   State Central Verse: John 8:58 - The profound claim of eternal self-existence.
-   Purpose: To explore Christ's relationship with time through Scripture, revealing His eternal nature and sovereignty.

### Section 1: Christ Before Time (10 min)

-   **The Eternal Word:** John 1:1-2
    -   "In the beginning was the Word..." - Existence *before* creation's start.
    -   "...the Word was with God..." - Distinct personality, eternal fellowship (John 17:5, 24).
    -   "...and the Word was God." - Explicit statement of divinity.
    -   [Whiteboard: John 1:1 - WORD = WITH GOD = WAS GOD (Eternal Fellowship & Divinity)]
-   **The Creator of Time:** John 1:3; Colossians 1:16-17
    -   "All things were made by him..." - Includes the dimension of time itself.
    -   He is *before* all things, and *in Him* all things consist (hold together).
    -   (RQ) If Christ created time, can time limit Him? How does this impact our understanding of His power?

### Section 2: Christ Entering Time [*] (12 min)

-   **The Incarnation Mystery:** Philippians 2:5-8
    -   "Being in the form of God... made himself of no reputation... took upon him the form of a servant... likeness of men."
    -   He didn't cease being God, but veiled His glory and accepted human limitations (John 1:14 - "Word became flesh").
    -   [Whiteboard: Phil 2:6-8 | God -> Humbled -> Servant -> Obedient Death]
    -   (RQ) Why would the eternal Creator subject Himself to the constraints of time He created?
-   **Identification with Humanity:** Hebrews 4:15
    -   "Tempted like as we are, yet without sin."
    -   He experienced time as we do: growth, weariness, schedules, waiting.
    -   He understands our temporal struggles intimately.
    -   [Analogy (from Heb 4:15): Like a deep-sea diver willingly putting on a heavy suit to rescue those trapped below; He took on our frame to save us.]
    -   [Aside: Consider the depth of this humility (Phil 2:7-8). The One who spoke galaxies into existence learned human language syllable by syllable. The Creator of time experienced waiting. He didn't just put on a human costume; He fully embraced the dependent, time-bound reality of human existence out of love for us.]

### Section 3: Christ Commanding Time (12 min)

-   **The Eternal "I AM":** John 8:58
    -   "Before Abraham was, I AM."
    -   Not "I was," but "I AM" - linking to God's covenant name (Exodus 3:14), signifying continuous, eternal existence.
    -   He exists outside the sequential flow of time.
    -   [Whiteboard: John 8:58 -> "I AM" (Eternal Present Existence)]
    -   (RQ) How does Christ's eternal "I AM" presence offer comfort in our time-bound anxieties?
-   **Lordship Over Time's Domain:** Mark 4:39 (Implied Authority)
    -   Calming the storm shows authority over creation.
    -   As Creator of time and space, He is Lord over them.
-   **The Beginning and The End:** Revelation 1:8; 22:13
    -   "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending... which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty."
    -   He encompasses all of history; He initiates and concludes God's plan within time.
    -   [Whiteboard: Timeline with ALPHA (Rev 1:8) at start, OMEGA (Rev 1:8) at end, CHRIST encompassing all.]
    -   [Aside: Instead of spending on ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. Christ used His time on earth for eternal purposes.]

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Recap:** Jesus Christ is not a figure *within* time like us. He is eternal God (John 1:1), the Creator *of* time (Col 1:16), who entered time for our salvation (Phil 2:7), identifies with our temporal struggles (Heb 4:15), and remains the eternally present "I AM" (John 8:58), the Sovereign Lord over all time (Rev 1:8).
-   **Practical Implications:**
    -   Our past regrets? He existed before them and offers forgiveness (1 John 1:9).
    -   Our present anxieties? The eternal "I AM" is with us now (Matt 28:20).
    -   Our future fears? The Alpha and Omega holds our future (Rev 1:8).
    -   [Whiteboard: Trust the LORD OF TIME with YOUR TIME.]
-   **Actionable Step (derived from John 8:58 & Rev 1:8):** When overwhelmed by time pressures or worries about past/future, pause and consciously acknowledge Jesus as the eternal "I AM," the Alpha and Omega who holds all things. Place the situation in His sovereign hands through prayer.
-   **Invitation:** Will you trust the One who transcends time with your moments, your days, your life, and your eternity? Acknowledge Him not just as Savior, but as the eternal Lord of All.
