    *   **(RQ)** What does a truly 'happy family' look like in God's eyes?
*   **Defining Happiness:** Beyond fleeting feelings.
    *   True happiness = Well-being, contentment, joyful purpose found in God's will.

*   **Roadmap:** Briefly outline the study's flow – exploring God's blueprint through key scriptures.

### Section 1: The True Foundation - Seeking God First (10-12 min)

*   **Focus Verse:** Matthew 6:33 - Unpacking "Seek ye first..."
    *   **(RQ)** What does it practically mean to put God's kingdom and righteousness *first* in family life?
    *   `[Whiteboard: Seek First = Priority (Time, Choices, Resources)]`
*   **Contrast:** Worldly priorities vs. Kingdom priorities.
    *   The danger of seeking things *before* God (Ref. Matt 6:25-32 context).
    *   Scripture: 1 Timothy 6:6-8 – Godliness with contentment is great gain; warning against love of money.
*   **The Promise:** "...all these things shall be added unto you."
    *   Trusting God's provision when His priorities are ours.
    *   **(RQ)** Do we live like we believe this promise?
*   **Obedience & Blessing:** Connecting seeking God with obedience.
    *   Scripture: John 14:15 ("If ye love me, keep my commandments.")
    *   Scripture: 1 John 5:3 ("For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.")
    *   `[Whiteboard: Obedience (Love) -> God's Blessing & True Happiness]`

### Section 2: Cultivating Contentment & True Value [*] (12-15 min)

*   **The Happiness Trap:** Missing present joy by chasing future circumstances or external validation.
    *   Valuing fleeting feelings over commitment, responsibility, God's will.
*   **Biblical Contentment:** Learning contentment regardless of circumstances.
    *   Scripture: Philippians 4:11-13 – Paul's secret: strength in Christ.
    *   **(RQ)** Where does Paul say his strength for contentment comes from? `[Whiteboard: Contentment = Christ's Strength (Phil 4:13)]`
    *   Contentment isn't complacency, but trust in God's sufficiency.
*   **Valuing Family Members:** Seeing each person as God's gift.
    *   Scripture: Psalm 127:3 – "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward."
    *   `[Whiteboard: Family Members = God's Heritage/Gift (Ps 127:3)]`
    *   **(RQ)** How does viewing spouse/children/parents as God's gift change our daily interactions and attitudes?
*   **Illustrative Concept:** `[Analogy (derived from Ps 127): Family like God's vineyard - He entrusts it to us to cultivate with care, reflecting His love. The 'fruit' is character, service, joy.]`
*   **Life's True Meaning:** More than material possessions.
    *   Ref. Luke 12:15 ("...a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.")
*   **Aside:** `[Aside: "Often, we treat family like furniture – expected to be there, functional, but not always cherished. But Scripture calls us to see them as precious souls entrusted to us, reflections of God's love, needing careful, prayerful attention."]`

### Section 3: Unified Purpose & Passing the Legacy (10-12 min)

*   **A Family United:** Finding purpose in serving God together.
    *   Scripture: Joshua 24:15 – The decisive commitment: "...as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
    *   `[Whiteboard: Joshua 24:15 - Our Family Serves the LORD]`
    *   **(RQ)** What does it look like, practically, for a family unit to serve God together today?
    *   Examples: Family worship, shared ministry/outreach, hospitality, supporting each other's spiritual growth.
*   **Parents' Sacred Duty:** Teaching God's priorities.
    *   Scripture: Deuteronomy 6:6-7 – God's words in the heart, taught diligently.
    *   `[Whiteboard: Teach Diligently (Deut 6:7) - Talk, Walk, Sit, Rise]`
    *   **(RQ)** How can we make teaching God's ways a natural part of daily family life, not just a formal event?
    *   Importance of *example* alongside precept.
    *   Scripture: Proverbs 22:6 ("Train up a child in the way he should go...")
    *   Scripture: Ephesians 6:4 ("...bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.")
*   **Aside:** `[Aside: "Building a Christian home isn't just about rules; it's about creating an atmosphere where heaven can draw near. It's like a little embassy of God's kingdom, demonstrating His love and principles to a watching world through our daily interactions."]`
