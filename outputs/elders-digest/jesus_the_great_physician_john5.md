### Introduction (5 min)

- Greeting & Prayer
- Introduce topic: Jesus as the ultimate Healer, physically and spiritually.
- Brief overview of the story at the Pool of Bethesda (John 5).
- Central Question: What does this encounter teach us about our need and God's
  provision? **(RQ)**
- [Write on board: Title - Jesus: The Great Physician (John 5)]

### Section 1: The Picture of Helplessness (John 5:1-7) (10 min)

- **The Need:** Describe the scene at Bethesda (v. 1-3).
  - A multitude of infirm folk - blind, halt, withered.
  - Waiting... for what? A superstitious hope (v. 4 - note textual variations,
    but focus on the waiting).
  - [Write on board: Bethesda = Place of Waiting/Infirmity]
- **Focus on the Man:** 38 years of infirmity (v. 5).
  - Symbolic of long-term, ingrained helplessness.
  - His own testimony: "I have no man... another steppeth down before me" (v.
    7). Utter inability to help himself.
  - [Write on board: 38 Years = Deep Helplessness]
- **The Biblical Principle:** Our spiritual condition mirrors this.
  - Romans 5:6 - "For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died
    for the ungodly."
  - We are spiritually infirm, unable to save ourselves from sin's paralysis.
  - [Write on board: Romans 5:6 - Without Strength]
- How often do we look to human effort or circumstances ('waiting for the
  water') instead of the true Source? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Divine Initiative of Grace (John 5:6, Bethesda) (8 min)

- **The Divine Search:** Jesus _saw_ him lying there and _knew_ his condition
  (v. 6).
  - Christ initiates; He seeks out the needy.
  - He didn't wait for the man to call Him.
  - [Write on board: Jesus Sees -> Knows -> Acts]
- **The Question of Desire:** "Wilt thou be made whole?" (v. 6).
  - Seems obvious, but probes deeper. Does he truly _want_ change, or is he
    comfortable in his condition? **(RQ)**
  - Applies to us: Do we truly desire freedom from sin? **(RQ)**
- **The Place of Grace:** Bethesda = "House of Mercy/Grace".
  - Grace isn't in the pool, but in the Person who came there.
  - Salvation is God's initiative, His unmerited favor seeking us.
  - [Write on board: Bethesda = House of Grace (God's Initiative)]
- [Aside: Like this man, we often focus on our limitations or blame
  circumstances ('I have no man...'), missing the presence of the One who offers
  true help standing right beside us.]

### Section 3: The Simple Command of Faith (John 5:8-9, Eph 2:8-9) (10 min) [*]

- **The Command:** Jesus doesn't offer sympathy or a process, but a direct
  command: "Rise, take up thy bed, and walk" (v. 8).
  - Requires immediate, simple faith and obedience.
  - No complex ritual, just taking God at His word.
  - [Write on board: Command = Rise, Take Up, Walk (Faith + Action)]
- **The Biblical Principle:** Salvation by Grace through Faith.
  - Ephesians 2:8-9 - "For by grace are ye saved through faith... not of
    works..."
  - The man's action wasn't the _cause_ of healing, but the _evidence_ of his
    faith in Christ's word.
  - [Write on board: Eph 2:8-9 - Grace -> Faith -> Salvation (Not Works)]
- **Bridging to Practice:** How does Christ call us to 'rise' today?
  - Repentance (Acts 3:19), Believing (John 3:16), Confession (Rom 10:9-10).
  - It requires a decision to trust and obey His word, even when it seems
    impossible.
  - [Analogy: Like learning to walk, the first step of faith might feel shaky,
    but it's taken in response to the Father's call.]
- **Actionable Step:** Identify one area where you feel spiritually 'paralyzed'.
  What is Christ's simple command in His Word for that situation? Choose to obey
  today.

### Section 4: Wholeness and Continued Obedience (John 5:9, 14) (7 min)

- **The Result:** "Immediately the man was made whole..." (v. 9).
  - Complete, instantaneous restoration by divine power.
  - He didn't just get strength _to_ walk, he _walked_ - demonstrating the
    reality of the healing.
- **The Follow-up & Warning:** Jesus finds him later (v. 14).
  - "Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto
    thee."
  - [Write on board: John 5:14 - Sin No More!]
- **The Deeper Meaning (Character Transformation):** Healing/Justification is
  the start, not the end.
  - The command points to ongoing sanctification â€“ a life lived in obedience out
    of gratitude for grace.
  - True wholeness involves turning away from the sin that leads to spiritual
    (and ultimately physical) death.
  - This isn't earning salvation, but living out the reality of the
    transformation God has begun (Phil 1:6).
  - [Aside: Our churches should be like spiritual 'rehab centers,' supporting
    believers in the ongoing journey of 'sinning no more,' strengthening them
    through fellowship and God's Word, reflecting the continued care of the
    Great Physician.]
- **Bridging to Practice:** Justification (being made right) must lead to
  Sanctification (living right). How does our daily life reflect the wholeness
  Christ offers? **(RQ)**
- **Actionable Step:** Reflect on John 5:14. Is there a pattern of sin you need
  to consciously turn from, relying on Christ's power, as evidence of your
  healing?

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** We are all spiritually helpless like the man (Rom 5:6). Jesus
  seeks us in grace (John 5:6). He commands us to rise in faith and obedience
  (John 5:8). This leads not just to forgiveness, but to transformation and a
  call to continued faithfulness (John 5:14).
- **The Invitation:** Jesus stands today as the Great Physician.
  - He sees your need. He asks, "Wilt thou be made whole?"
  - The call is simple: Trust His word, rise from spiritual paralysis, and walk
    in newness of life.
- **Final Appeal:** Recognize your helplessness. Accept His grace. Respond in
  faith and obedience. Don't just be healed _from_ something, be made whole
  _for_ Him.
- Closing Prayer
