### Introduction (6 min)
-   What *is* the Church according to Scripture? God's called-out people, a spiritual house, a holy nation (1 Peter 2:9-10), the household of God built on Christ (Eph 2:19-22). Not primarily a building.
-   God's Appointed Agency: Established by Christ for the perfecting of the saints, the work of ministry, and edifying the body (Eph 4:11-13). It's His instrument for salvation and service (cf. Acts of the Apostles, p. 9).
    -   [Whiteboard: Church = God's People (1 Pet 2:9) for Ministry (Eph 4:12)]
-   The Core Task: Given directly by Christ - Our marching orders found in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20).
-   (RQ) Why did God establish the church? What is its primary function according to these foundational scriptures (Eph 4:12, Matt 28:19-20)?

### Section 1: The Global Mandate (10 min)
-   The Command: "Go..." (Matt 28:19a). This is an imperative, not a suggestion. It echoes Christ's earlier command to preach (Mark 16:15). Foundational to our existence.
-   The Scope: "...teach [make disciples of] all nations" (Matt 28:19a), "...preach the gospel to every creature" (Mark 16:15). The reach is explicitly universal.
    -   [Whiteboard: GO -> ALL NATIONS (Matt 28:19)]
-   The Prophetic Urgency: This gospel *must* reach the world as a witness before the end comes (Matt 24:14). Our mission has eschatological significance.
    -   [Write on board: Gospel to World -> THEN the End (Matt 24:14)]
-   (RQ) How seriously do we take the "all nations" aspect of this command (Matt 28:19) today in our personal lives and church plans?
-   Our Solemn Responsibility: We are warned of the consequence of neglecting this duty (Ezekiel 3:18-19); Paul felt a necessity laid upon him (1 Cor 9:16). (cf. Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 631).

### Section 2: The Message & Representation [*] (12 min)
-   The Core Message: God has given us the "ministry of reconciliation" (2 Cor 5:18) and the "word of reconciliation" (2 Cor 5:19). It's about restoring humanity's relationship with God through Christ.
    -   [Whiteboard: Message = Reconciliation through Christ (2 Cor 5:18-19)]
-   Our Role: We are "ambassadors for Christ" (2 Cor 5:20a). This means we officially represent His kingdom, His message, and His character.
    -   [Analogy (from 2 Cor 5:20): Like an ambassador in a foreign land - faithfully representing the home kingdom's message and character, not adopting local customs contrary to it.]
-   The Heart of Our Appeal: As though God were pleading through us, "Be ye reconciled to God" (2 Cor 5:20b).
-   Living Representation: Our lives must reflect the kingdom we represent. We are called to be "salt of the earth" (preserving truth, hindering corruption) and "light of the world" (illuminating darkness with God's character revealed in good works) (Matt 5:13-14, 16).
    -   (RQ) If we are ambassadors (2 Cor 5:20), how well does our daily life represent the kingdom we claim? Does our 'salt' retain its savor, does our 'light' shine through good works? (Matt 5:13, 16)
-   Restoring the Erring: Part of representing Christ's character involves gently restoring those caught in sin (Gal 6:1), seeking to save souls from death (James 5:19-20).
    -   [Whiteboard: Restore Gently (Gal 6:1)]
    -   Sensitivity Needed: Reflecting Christ's method – He didn't condemn but called to repentance and offered restoration (John 8:10-11; cf. Luke 15:1-7). (cf. Desire of Ages, p. 440).
-   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven (Phil 3:20), not blend indistinguishably with the surrounding culture.]

### Section 3: The Power, Preparation & Preservation (11 min)
-   Essential Power: We cannot fulfill this mission alone. Christ commanded the disciples to wait for "power from on high" (Luke 24:49) and promised the Holy Spirit for witness (Acts 1:8).
    -   [Whiteboard: Power = Holy Spirit (Luke 24:49, Acts 1:8)]
-   The Result of Spirit-filled Witness: When the church is empowered by the Spirit and faithful in witness, the Lord adds to the church daily those being saved (Acts 2:47). It's His work through yielded instruments.
-   (RQ) Are we actively seeking the Spirit's power for witness (Acts 1:8), or relying primarily on our own strength and programs?
-   Nurturing Believers: The commission includes "Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you" (Matt 28:20a). This requires intentional follow-up, discipleship, and grounding in the Word (Acts 2:42; Eph 4:11-13). (cf. Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 68).
    -   [Whiteboard: Teach All Things Commanded (Matt 28:20a)]
    -   (RQ) How effectively do we fulfill this *second* part of the commission: "Teaching them to observe all things..."? (Matt 28:20a)
-   Upholding Biblical Standards: Part of teaching obedience involves upholding God's standards of truth and conduct, aiming for a church "holy and without blemish" (Eph 5:27). This reflects God's character and maintains the purity of the body (1 Cor 5:6-7; Titus 2:11-14). (cf. Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 292).
    -   [Whiteboard: Uphold God's Standards (Eph 5:27, Titus 2:11-14)]
    -   This isn't about judgmental exclusion, but about faithfully handling the Word of truth (2 Tim 2:15) and maintaining the integrity of the message we carry (Titus 1:9).

### Conclusion (6 min)
-   Recap: The Church's task is a clear, divine commission (Matt 28:19-20), fueled by the Spirit (Acts 1:8), delivering a message of reconciliation (2 Cor 5:18-19). It requires faithful representation as salt and light (Matt 5:13-16), gentle restoration (Gal 6:1), and diligent teaching and nurturing (Matt 28:20a, Eph 4:11-13).
-   Measure of True Faithfulness: Not just profession ("Lord, Lord"), but doing the will of the Father (Matt 7:21). Faith without works is dead (James 2:17-18). (cf. Gospel Workers, p. 200).
-   (RQ) How does our church measure up by this standard of faithful work derived from Scripture? How do *we* measure up individually?
-   Personal Call: Are we active participants in God's appointed agency (Eph 4:12)? Are we fulfilling our role as ambassadors (2 Cor 5:20)?
-   Invitation: Commit this week to understanding and participating more fully in the church's true mission. Identify one specific way derived from these texts: be salt or light (Matt 5:13-16), share the message of reconciliation (2 Cor 5:20), help restore or nurture someone in faith (Gal 6:1-2, Matt 28:20a).
