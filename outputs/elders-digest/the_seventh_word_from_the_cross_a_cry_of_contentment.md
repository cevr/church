### Introduction (5 min)

- Set the scene: Calvary, the sixth hour darkness passed, the end is near.
- Introduce the Seventh Word: A final, clear cry of trust, not despair.
- Theme: Christ's ultimate act of faith, demonstrating contentment and victory
  even in death, providing a pattern for us.
- **(RQ)** What does this final statement reveal about Christ's relationship
  with the Father, even after crying out, "My God, why hast thou forsaken me?"

### Section 1: The Final Commitment (10 min)

- **The Cry of Trust:** Luke 23:46
  - A loud voice: Signifying remaining strength, conscious decision.
  - "Father": Restored communion, intimacy.
  - "Into thy hands I commend my spirit": Complete surrender and trust.
  - [Whiteboard: Luke 23:46 - "Father... commend my spirit"] - Underline
    "Father" & "commend"
- **Fulfillment of Scripture:** Psalm 31:5
  - Direct quote, showing Christ's death aligned with prophetic Word.
  - David's prayer of trust becomes the Messiah's final declaration.
  - [Whiteboard: Luke 23:46 <-> Psalm 31:5 (Prophecy Fulfilled)]
  - **(RQ)** How does knowing this was prophesied reinforce our confidence in
    God's sovereign plan?

### Section 2: Voluntary Sacrifice & Divine Plan (12 min) [*]

- **A Willing Sacrifice:** John 10:17-18
  - Emphasis: Christ _laid down_ His life; it wasn't merely taken by force.
  - He had power over His own life – demonstrating divinity even in death.
  - [Whiteboard: John 10:18 - "I lay it down of Myself"] - Contrast with "No man
    taketh it..."
  - **(RQ)** Why is it crucial for our salvation that Christ's death was
    voluntary?
- **God's Plan, Man's Wickedness:** Acts 2:23
  - God's determinate counsel and foreknowledge: The cross was not an accident
    or tragedy from God's perspective.
  - Yet, accomplished through wicked hands: Human beings bear responsibility for
    their actions.
  - [Whiteboard: God's Plan (Acts 2:23a) + Human Wickedness (Acts 2:23b) =
    Cross]
- **Trust Amidst Suffering:** (Ref. _Desire of Ages_, Ch. 77, "It Is Finished")
  - EGW describes Christ's final moments: Not yielding to despair, but resting
    in Father's love and acceptance.
  - Victory declared even as life ebbed away.
  - [Aside: Christ's final breath wasn't a gasp of defeat, but a sigh of
    accomplishment. Like a runner crossing the finish line, He completed the
    ultimate race set before Him, securing victory not just for Himself, but for
    all who would follow.]

### Section 3: The Purpose and Our Response (12 min)

- **Altruistic Atonement:**
  - "For me": Galatians 2:20 - Salvation is personal. Christ died _my_ death.
  - "For us all": Romans 8:32 - God gave His Son universally.
  - "For our sins": 1 Peter 3:18 - Substitutionary. The Just (Christ) for the
    unjust (us).
  - [Whiteboard: Christ Died: For Me (Gal 2:20), For Us All (Rom 8:32), For Our
    Sins (1 Pet 3:18)]
  - He took the penalty the Law required for sin.
  - **(RQ)** How does understanding the _personal_ aspect ("for me") deepen our
    gratitude and commitment?
- **Practical Application: Committing Ourselves to God:**
  - **The Need:** We face trials, uncertainties, anxieties, and ultimately,
    death.
  - **The Biblical Principle (Luke 23:46):** Follow Christ's example – commit
    our spirit, our lives, our situations into God's faithful hands.
  - **Bridging to Practice:** If Christ trusted the Father in the ultimate
    trial, can we trust Him in ours? **(RQ)**
    - [Analogy: Like entrusting valuables to a secure bank vault, we commit our
      souls to the utterly trustworthy hands of our Father.]
  - **Actionable Steps:**
    - 1.  **Daily Prayer:** Consciously commit your day, worries, and spirit to
          God each morning (cf. 1 Peter 5:7 - Casting cares). [Whiteboard:
          Action 1: Daily Commitment (Prayer - 1 Pet 5:7)]
    - 2.  **In Trials:** Verbally pray, "Father, into Your hands I commit [this
          situation/my spirit]" (Luke 23:46). [Whiteboard: Action 2: Prayer in
          Trials (Luke 23:46)]
    - 3.  **At Life's End:** Prepare to meet death with the same trust, resting
          in Christ's finished work and God's presence (cf. Psalm 23:4).
          [Whiteboard: Action 3: Trust at End of Life (Ps 23:4)]
