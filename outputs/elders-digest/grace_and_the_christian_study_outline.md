### Introduction (5 min)

*   Welcome & Opening Prayer
*   Introduce Topic: What is grace? Is it just a 'get out of jail free' card, or something more profound?
*   Common Misconceptions vs. Biblical Reality
    *   Some see grace as license; others struggle with legalism.
    *   Goal: Understand the *transformative power* of biblical grace.
*   Read Central Verse: Titus 2:11-12. Grace brings salvation *and* teaches us how to live.
*   [Write on board: GRACE (Titus 2:11-12) = Salvation + Teaching for Godly Living]

### Section 1: Grace Defined & Salvation Secured (10 min)

*   **What is Grace?**
    *   Unmerited Favor: God's kindness to the undeserving (Rom 3:23-24).
    *   Divine Enablement: God's power working in us (1 Cor 15:10).
    *   Source of Joy/Delight: God's loving attitude towards us (Zeph 3:17 - context of restoration).
    *   [Whiteboard: Grace = Unmerited Favor + Divine Power]
*   **Salvation: Solely by Grace**
    *   Read Ephesians 2:8-9: Saved by grace through faith, *not* works.
        *   **(RQ)** If salvation isn't by works, why does verse 10 immediately talk about good works?
    *   Our Status: Unworthy Servants (Luke 17:10).
        *   We can never *earn* salvation; we simply do our duty.
        *   **(RQ)** How does understanding our 'unworthiness' actually *increase* our appreciation for grace? (Luke 7:47)
    *   [Whiteboard: Eph 2:8-9 -> Faith receives Grace -> Salvation (Gift)]

### Section 2: Grace Empowers & Teaches Holy Living (12 min) [*]

*   **Grace is Not Passive: It Teaches & Transforms**
    *   Re-read Titus 2:11-14: Grace *teaches* us to deny ungodliness and live righteously.
        *   It's an active instructor, not just a passive pardon.
        *   [Whiteboard: Titus 2:12 - Grace Teaches: DENY (Ungodliness) -> LIVE (Soberly, Righteously, Godly)]
    *   **(RQ)** How does grace itself provide the motivation and power to deny sin, according to this passage?
*   **Holy Living: Possible Only Through Grace**
    *   Read Philippians 2:12-13: Work out your salvation... for it is *God* who works in you.
        *   Our effort + God's empowerment = Sanctification.
        *   [Analogy (from Phil 2:13): Like breathing - we must inhale (receive God's power/grace) and exhale (live it out), but God provides the 'air' and the ability.]
    *   Read Philippians 4:13: I can do all things *through Christ* who strengthens me.
        *   This includes overcoming sin and living righteously.
    *   [Aside: Sometimes we focus so much on 'not sinning' that we forget the positive command: 'live soberly, righteously, and godly.' Grace empowers both the 'denying' and the 'living'. It's not just about avoiding evil, but actively pursuing good through His strength.]

### Section 3: Growing & Standing Firm in Grace (12 min)

*   **The Call to Grow in Grace**
    *   Read 2 Peter 3:18: Command to *grow* in grace and knowledge.
        *   Grace isn't static; our experience of it should deepen.
        *   **(RQ)** What does 'growing in grace' look like practically?
    *   Means of Growth:
        *   Word of God (Acts 20:32 - word of His grace builds you up).
        *   Prayer/Accessing the Throne (Heb 4:16 - come boldly for mercy and grace).
        *   [Whiteboard: Growth in Grace (2 Pet 3:18) via -> Word (Acts 20:32) & Prayer (Heb 4:16)]
*   **Warnings Concerning Grace** [*]
    *   Don't Receive in Vain (2 Cor 6:1): Don't accept the gift without the transformation it brings.
    *   Don't Use as License (Jude 4): Turning grace into an excuse for sin.
    *   Don't Fall From Grace (Gal 5:4): Trying to be justified by law (legalism).
    *   Don't Despise Grace (Heb 10:26-31): Willful, persistent sin after knowing the truth tramples Christ's sacrifice.
        *   **(RQ)** Based on Heb 10:26-29, what is the danger of presuming upon God's grace while choosing to continue in known sin?
*   **Established by Grace**
    *   Read Hebrews 13:9: Good for the heart to be established by grace, not external rituals/foods.
        *   True spiritual stability comes from relying on God's grace, not human efforts or traditions.
        *   [Whiteboard: Stability -> Heart Established by GRACE (Heb 13:9)]
    *   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassiesâ€”territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Similarly, our hearts established by grace become embassies of heaven within us.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

*   Summary: Grace is God's unmerited favor *and* His divine power that saves us (Eph 2:8), teaches us (Titus 2:11-12), empowers us for holy living (Phil 2:13), and in which we must grow (2 Pet 3:18) and stand firm (Heb 13:9).
*   Grace is not opposed to effort; it empowers right effort.
*   Grace is not opposed to obedience; it is the *source* of true obedience.
*   **(RQ)** Are you relying fully on God's grace, not just for forgiveness, but for daily strength and transformation?
*   Invitation:
    *   To accept God's free gift of salvation through grace.
    *   To embrace the teaching power of grace for daily living.
    *   To commit to growing in grace through prayer and study (Heb 4:16, Acts 20:32).
    *   To ask God to establish your heart firmly in His grace (Heb 13:9).
*   Closing Prayer
