### Introduction (5 min)

*   Welcome & Opening Prayer
*   Introduce Psalm 126: Context of return from exile, transition from sorrow to joy.
*   Focus on v. 5-6: The principle of sowing (effort, tears) leading to reaping (joy, harvest).
*   Introduce the central metaphor: What is this "precious seed"? **(RQ)**
*   [Write on board: Psalm 126:5-6 - Sow Tears -> Reap Joy]
*   Thesis: Understanding the nature of the seed, the field, and the method of sowing is crucial for fulfilling our mission and experiencing the promised joy.

### Section 1: The Precious Seed Defined (12 min)

*   **A. The Seed is the Word of God:**
    *   Direct link: Psalm 126:6 ("precious seed") & Mark 4:14 ("The sower soweth the word").
    *   It contains divine truths for eternal life. (Connect to 1 Peter 1:23 - incorruptible seed).
    *   [Write on board: Precious Seed = Word of God (Mk 4:14)]
*   **B. Sown in Purity:**
    *   Emphasis on original purity, without human additions/speculations. (Reference COL, p. 39 concept).
    *   Guard against infidelity born from questioning inspiration. Why is purity vital? **(RQ)**
    *   [Write on board: Requirement: PURE Seed (No mixture)]
    *   [Aside: Like planting genetically pure seeds yields the expected crop, sowing pure doctrine yields true converts. Mixing leads to confusion and weak growth.]
*   **C. The Everlasting Gospel:**
    *   The seed's content = The Everlasting Gospel (Rev 14:6).
    *   What are the core components of this gospel message? **(RQ)** (Creation, Fall, Redemption, Judgment, Restoration).
    *   [Write on board: Content = Everlasting Gospel (Rev 14:6)]
*   **D. Living, Vital, Precious:**
    *   The Word is not dead letters, but living and powerful (Heb 4:12).
    *   Inherent life-giving power (1 Peter 1:23).
    *   [Concept: Seed contains the blueprint for the entire plant; the Word contains God's plan for life.]
*   **E. No Substitute:**
    *   Human wisdom, traditions, or philosophies cannot replace God's Word for salvation.
    *   Why do people sometimes try to substitute the Word? **(RQ)**

### Section 2: The Field & The Sower's Role (10 min) [*]

*   **A. The Field is the World:**
    *   The Great Commission: "Go ye into all the world..." (Mark 16:15).
    *   No geographical or cultural limits.
    *   [Write on board: Field = The World (Mk 16:15)]
*   **B. Specifically, Every Human Heart:**
    *   The ultimate soil is the individual heart (Ref. Parable of Sower - different soils, Luke 8:11-15).
    *   Our target is personal connection and transformation.
    *   [Draw simple diagram: Seed -> Heart]
*   **C. Every Believer's Sphere:**
    *   This isn't just for pastors/evangelists. Every believer has a part to play.
    *   What is *your* sphere of influence? **(RQ)** (Home, work, community).
*   **D. Co-workers with Christ:**
    *   We don't sow alone; we partner with Christ (1 Cor 3:9).
    *   He provides the seed, the growth, the power.
    *   What does it mean to be a 'co-worker' practically? **(RQ)**
    *   [Write on board: Sower = YOU (Co-worker w/ Christ)]

### Section 3: The Method of Sowing (10 min)

*   **A. Requires Skill & Wisdom:**
    *   Diligence: Consistent effort needed.
    *   Skill/Spiritual Knowledge: Understanding the Word deeply.
    *   Wisdom from Above: Knowing how/when/what to share (James 1:5).
    *   Right Division: Handling truth accurately (2 Tim 2:15).
    *   [Write on board: Method - Skill/Wisdom (2 Tim 2:15)]
    *   How do we acquire this wisdom and skill? **(RQ)** (Study, prayer, experience).
*   **B. Sow Plentifully:**
    *   Don't be sparse; be generous with sharing the Word (Ref. 2 Cor 9:6 - sow bountifully, reap bountifully).
    *   Look for opportunities constantly.
    *   [Analogy: Farmer scattering seed widely to maximize potential harvest.]
*   **C. Dependence on the Holy Spirit:**
    *   Prayer is essential: For guidance, for hearts to be receptive, for power.
    *   Humility: Recognizing we are instruments, God gives the increase (1 Cor 3:6-7).
    *   Earnest Faith: Believing God *will* work through His Word (Ref. COL, p. 59 concept).
    *   [Write on board: Method - Prayer & Spirit Dependence]
    *   [Aside: Sometimes our best-laid plans fail, while a simple, Spirit-prompted word bears fruit. It reminds us where the true power lies – not in our eloquence, but in God's Spirit blessing His Word.]
