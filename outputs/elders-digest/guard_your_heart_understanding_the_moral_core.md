### Introduction (5 min)

-   **The Command:** Guard your heart (Prov 4:23). Why? "Out of it are the issues of life."
    -   [Whiteboard: Prov 4:23 - HEART -> Issues of Life]
-   **What is the 'Moral Heart'?** Not just emotion. In Scripture, includes:
    -   Intellect (Understanding)
    -   Emotion (Feelings)
    -   Conscience (Moral Compass)
    -   Will (Choice/Decision)
    -   [Whiteboard: Add under HEART: Intellect | Emotion | Conscience | Will]
-   **Goal:** Understand each component and how to care for it biblically for spiritual health and character development.

### The Intellect: Foundation of Truth (10 min)

-   **Role:** Processing information, understanding, forming beliefs.
-   **Essential Food: Truth**
    -   Freedom through Truth: John 8:32. What kind of freedom does knowing truth bring? **(RQ)**
    -   Jesus IS Truth: John 14:6. Ultimate source.
    -   [Whiteboard: INTELLECT -> Needs TRUTH (John 8:32, 14:6)]
-   **Exercising the Intellect:**
    -   Study & Meditation: 1 Timothy 4:13 (Give attendance to reading, exhortation, doctrine), 2 Timothy 2:15 (Study to shew thyself approved). How does diligent study 'approve' us before God? **(RQ)**
    -   [Whiteboard: Exercise Intellect: Study (2 Tim 2:15), Meditate (1 Tim 4:13)]
-   **Protecting the Intellect:**
    -   Applying Truth: Not just knowing, but doing. Connects to transformation (Rom 12:2).
-   **Faith as Intellectual Persuasion:**
    -   Belief in the Heart (Mind/Intellect): Romans 10:10.
    -   Source of Faith: Hearing God's Word (evidence) - Romans 10:17.
    -   [Analogy (from Rom 10:17): Faith isn't a blind leap in the dark, but stepping onto a bridge tested and proven trustworthy by God's reliable Word (evidence).]

### Governing the Emotions [*] (10 min)

-   **Role:** Feelings, responses. God-given, but need direction.
-   **Control via Directed Intellect:**
    -   Focus on the Wholesome: Philippians 4:8. Directing thoughts shapes feelings. [Whiteboard: Thoughts (Phil 4:8) -> Direct Emotions -> Peace]. What dominates our thought-life? **(RQ)**
    -   Sober Thinking: 1 Peter 1:13 ("Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober..."). How does mental discipline ('girding up') help manage emotional reactions? **(RQ)**
-   **Practical Steps (derived from Phil 4:8):**
    1.  Identify negative thought patterns.
    2.  Consciously choose to dwell on truth, purity, virtue found in God's Word.
    3.  Pray for the Holy Spirit's help in redirecting thoughts.
-   [Aside: "Our emotional responses often reveal what truths we truly believe in our intellect. If we panic in trials, perhaps we haven't fully grasped God's promises intellectually and need to revisit His Word."]

### Educating the Conscience (10 min)

-   **Role:** Inner judge/moral compass. Operates based on its standard.
    -   Natural Law: Romans 2:14-15 (Work of the law written in hearts, conscience bearing witness).
-   **Need for God's Standard:**
    -   Must be informed by divine truth/righteousness. Not self or culture.
    -   Cleansing/Purification: Hebrews 10:22 (Heart sprinkled from an evil conscience). Requires Christ's work.
    -   [Whiteboard: CONSCIENCE -> Needs God's Standard (Bible) -> True Guidance (Heb 10:22)]. Is my conscience calibrated to God's Word or worldly standards? **(RQ)**
-   **Danger of Desensitization:**
    -   'Past Feeling': Ephesians 4:19. Repeatedly ignoring its warnings sears it.
    -   Shipwrecked Faith: 1 Timothy 1:19. Putting away good conscience leads to spiritual disaster.
    -   [Illustration Concept (from Eph 4:19): Like physical callouses dulling touch, spiritual callouses from ignored conviction dull our sensitivity to sin.] How do 'small' compromises contribute to becoming 'past feeling'? **(RQ)**
-   **Maintaining a Good Conscience:** Actively align life with known truth (Acts 24:16).

### Empowering the Will (5 min)

-   **Role:** The power of choice; the decision-making faculty.
    -   Directs Intellect (Choose what to study/believe).
    -   Restrains Emotions (Choose response based on truth).
    -   Forms Habits (Consistent choices build character).
-   **The Deciding Power:**
    -   Choose Your Master: Joshua 24:15; Romans 6:16. The will determines allegiance.
    -   [Whiteboard: WILL -> Power to Choose (Josh 24:15) -> Determines Master (Rom 6:16)]
-   **Strengthening the Will:**
    -   Exercise through Obedience: Small acts of choosing God's way build strength.
    -   Dependence on Divine Power: Phil 2:13 (God works in you to will and to do).
-   [Aside: "The will is like the captain of a ship. The intellect provides the map (God's Word), the emotions are the winds (powerful but need managing), the conscience is the compass (needs calibration to God's truth). The captain (will) must choose daily to use the map and compass to steer, relying on God's power, regardless of the winds."]

### Conclusion and Appeal (5 min)

-   **Recap:** The 'moral heart' (Prov 4:23) is complex: Intellect, Emotion, Conscience, Will. All interconnected.
    -   [Point back to Whiteboard diagram]
-   **Holistic Care:** Spiritual health requires nurturing *each* part according to Scripture.
    -   Feed Intellect with Truth.
    -   Direct Emotions via Truth.
    -   Educate Conscience by God's Standard.
    -   Exercise Will in Obedience to God.
-   **Transformation:** This isn't just self-help; it's about cooperating with God's transforming power (Rom 12:2, Ezek 36:26 - new heart, new spirit).
-   **Invitation:** Will you commit today to diligently guard *your* moral heart? To surrender each faculty—intellect, emotion, conscience, will—to the Lordship of Christ and the guidance of His Word?
-   **Final Thought:** Guarding the heart is active, daily work, impossible in our own strength, but achievable through His grace as we choose to cooperate.
