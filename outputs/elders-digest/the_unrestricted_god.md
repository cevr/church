### Introduction (5 min)
- Hook: We live in a world defined by limits (time, resources, strength). Do we project these onto God?
- Introduce concept: An Unrestricted God vs. our often restricted view.
- State Central Verse: Jeremiah 32:27. God's own challenge to perceived limitations.
- [Whiteboard: Write Title & Jer 32:27]
- Purpose: To explore Scripture revealing God's unlimited nature and power, available in *every* circumstance.

### Section 1: God of Hills AND Valleys (10 min)
- **The Human Misconception:**
    - Read/Explain 1 Kings 20:23 - Syrians' limited view: God only powerful in certain terrains ('hills').
    - (RQ) Do we ever subconsciously think God is more present/powerful during success ('hills') than trials ('valleys')?
- **God's Reality:**
    - Read/Explain 1 Kings 20:28 - God's response: He is God of BOTH hills and valleys. His power isn't situational.
    - [Whiteboard: 1 Kings 20:28 - God of Hills = God of Valleys]
- **Biblical Confirmation: Omnipresence:**
    - Explore Psalm 139:7-12 - David's understanding: No escape from God's presence, light or dark, high or low.
    - [Whiteboard: Psalm 139:7-12 -> Omnipresent -> No Place Excludes God]
    - Connect: God's presence isn't restricted by geography, circumstance, or our feelings.

### Section 2: The Restriction of Unbelief [*] (8 min)
- **The Paradox:** Can an unlimited God be limited?
    - Read Mark 6:5-6 - Jesus *could* do few mighty works there *because of their unbelief*.
    - Clarify: The limitation wasn't in God's *power*, but in the people's *receptivity* due to unbelief.
    - [Whiteboard: Unbelief (Mark 6:5-6) -> Blocks Reception of God's Power]
- **The Necessity of Faith:**
    - Reference Hebrews 11:6 - Impossible to please God without faith; must believe He IS and REWARDS.
    - (RQ) How does our personal lack of faith (in His presence, power, goodness) practically restrict what God can do *for* and *through* us, based on Mark 6?
- **Our Perspective Matters:**
    - Unbelief creates a 'restricted God' in our *experience*.
    - [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] Our lives should reflect the unlimited resources of heaven, not the perceived limitations of our circumstances. We represent an unrestricted King.

### Section 3: God With Us: The Incarnation (8 min)
- **God Enters the Valley:**
    - Read John 1:14 - "The Word became flesh and dwelt among us." God didn't stay distant.
    - [Whiteboard: John 1:14 -> Incarnation = God enters HUMAN experience]
    - Significance: The unlimited God willingly entered our limited, 'valley' experience.
- **He Understands:**
    - Read Hebrews 4:15 - Jesus tempted in all points as we are, yet without sin.
    - He knows our weaknesses, struggles, limitations from the inside.
    - [Whiteboard: Hebrews 4:15 -> Sympathetic High Priest -> Understands our 'Valley']
- **Bridging the Gap:**
    - The Incarnation proves God isn't just God *of* the valley, but God *in* the valley *with* us.
    - (RQ) How does knowing Jesus experienced human weakness (Heb 4:15) change how we view God's presence and power in our own struggles?

### Section 4: Power in the Valley (10 min)
- **Strength Perfected in Weakness:**
    - Read 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 - Paul's 'thorn'; God's response: "My grace is sufficient... My strength is made perfect in weakness."
    - Principle: God's power is often most evident *through* our acknowledged weakness, not in spite of it.
    - [Whiteboard: Weakness + Faith -> God's Power Manifest (2 Cor 12:9)]
- **The All-Sufficient God (El Shaddai):**
    - Reference Genesis 17:1 - God reveals Himself as 'El Shaddai' (Almighty/All-Sufficient God).
    - Connect to Philippians 4:19 - "My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus."
    - [Whiteboard: El Shaddai (Gen 17:1) + Phil 4:19 = God is ENOUGH for every need/valley]
- **Practical Application from Texts:**
    - [Analogy (from 2 Cor 12:9): God's power like electricity - flows best through yielded, 'weak' conduits who rely on Him.]
    - (RQ) Instead of hiding weakness, how can we present it to God as an opportunity for His strength (2 Cor 12:9)?
    - [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] Even our trials ('valleys') can become platforms for God to display His unrestricted power and sufficiency, turning worldly challenges into opportunities for divine witness, showing He is truly El Shaddai.
    - Action Steps (derived from texts):
        1.  Acknowledge weakness & dependence (2 Cor 12:9-10).
        2.  Replace unbelief with active faith/trust (Heb 11:6, Mark 6:6 implication).
        3.  Claim God's sufficiency for the specific need (Phil 4:19).

### Conclusion and Appeal (4 min)
- Recap Main Points:
    - God is unlimited, Lord of hills AND valleys (1 Kings 20:28, Ps 139).
    - Our unbelief restricts our *experience*, not His power (Mark 6:5-6).
    - God entered our valley (Incarnation - John 1:14) and understands (Heb 4:15).
    - He provides sufficient grace and power precisely *in* our weakness/valleys (2 Cor 12:9, Phil 4:19).
- Reiterate Central Verse: Jeremiah 32:27 - Is anything too hard for the Lord?
- Final Thought: Stop placing human limitations on the Unrestricted God.
- Appeal: Choose faith. Trust His presence and power in your current 'valley' or 'hill'. Invite Him to demonstrate His sufficiency.
