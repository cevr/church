### Introduction (5 min)

*   Hook: Describe the feeling of being trapped, facing an impossible situation (financial, health, relational, spiritual).
*   Introduce the Narrative: Israel at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:1-12) - Pharaoh's army behind, impassable sea before.
    *   [Whiteboard: Draw simple map: Egypt <- Israelites -> Red Sea]
*   Purpose: To learn from Exodus 14-15 God's unchanging principles for navigating our own 'impossible' circumstances.
*   Read Central Verse: Exodus 14:13-14.
    *   [Whiteboard: Title + Ex 14:13-14]
*   Transition: What does God require when we face our 'Red Sea'?

### Section 1: The Crisis & God's Command (12 min)

*   **The People's Reaction: Fear and Complaint (Ex 14:10-12)**
    *   Focus on the past (Egypt) instead of God's promises.
    *   **(RQ)** How often does fear make us look backward instead of upward? (cf. Lot's wife - Gen 19:26)
*   **Moses' Response: Confidence in God (Ex 14:13-14)**
    *   **Principle:** Confidence/Trust is Essential.
        *   Freely Given: A choice against fear. [Whiteboard: FEAR vs. FAITH (Trust - Ex 14:13)]
        *   Firmly Expressed: Bold declaration of God's action.
        *   Fully Experienced: Leads to seeing God work (1 Tim 4:10 - trust in the *living* God).
*   **God's Surprising Command: "Go forward" (Ex 14:15)**
    *   **Principle:** Active Faith & Obedience Required.
        *   Contrasts passive waiting with active steps of faith.
        *   [Whiteboard: Trust (v.13) + Obedience (v.15) = Deliverance]
        *   **(RQ)** Are we waiting for God to remove the obstacle, or are we listening for His command to move *through* it?
    *   Connects to Character Building: Trust and obedience under pressure forge resilience.

### Section 2: The Nature of Obedience [*] (10 min)

*   **Principle: Obedience Must Be Unwavering (Ex 14:16, 21-22)**
    *   Required action despite the visible impossibility (the sea).
    *   Trusting God's method over human reasoning (Isaiah 55:8-9).
    *   **(RQ)** Do we delay obedience when God's instructions seem illogical or difficult?
*   **Principle: Obedience Guided by God's Authority (Ex 14:16 - The Rod)**
    *   The rod: Symbol of God-given authority and power.
    *   [Whiteboard: Rod = God's Authority / His Word]
    *   Action required: Stretch out the hand (simple act of obedience activating divine power).
    *   [Analogy (from Ex 14:16): God's Word (Bible) is our 'rod' today – pointing the way through impossibility when obeyed.]
*   **Principle: Obedience Leads to Separation (Ex 14:22, 29-30)**
    *   Separation *from* Egypt (bondage, sin, the past).
    *   Separation *to* God (His path, His purpose).
    *   [Whiteboard: Obedience -> Separation from Sin -> Consecration to God]
    *   [Aside: Our church buildings represent our collective witness... like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Our obedience creates this distinction.]
    *   Character Building: True obedience purifies motives and separates us from worldly compromises.

### Section 3: The Outcome & Our Response (12 min)

*   **God's Mighty Deliverance (Ex 14:21-31)**
    *   Waters divided, pathway made, enemies destroyed.
    *   God does what only He can do (Eph 3:20 - exceedingly abundantly).
*   **Response 1: Wonder and Worship (Ex 15:1-2)**
    *   Spontaneous, heartfelt praise and testimony.
    *   [Whiteboard: Deliverance -> Wonder -> Worship (Ex 15:1)]
    *   Recognizing God's character: Strength, salvation, faithfulness.
    *   **(RQ)** When God answers prayer or delivers us, is our first response genuine worship and acknowledgment of Him?
*   **Response 2: Witness (Ex 15:14-16)**
    *   The impact on surrounding nations: Fear/respect for God.
    *   Our experiences become powerful testimonies.
    *   [Whiteboard: Worship -> Witness (Ex 15:14)]
    *   Evangelism/3 Angels' Messages Link: Personal stories of God's power are vital in sharing the everlasting gospel.
*   **End-Time Significance:**
    *   **Red Sea as a Type:** Foreshadows God's final deliverance of His people from overwhelming forces (Time of Jacob's Trouble - Jer 30:7).
        *   [Whiteboard: Red Sea ≈ End-Time Deliverance]
    *   **Song of Moses and the Lamb (Rev 15:2-3):** The redeemed sing of God's deliverance, linking past and future acts.
    *   **Last Generation Theology:** The command to 'move forward' in faith against impossible odds, trusting God's Word implicitly, is the experience required of those who live through earth's final crisis. (Ref. EGW, Great Controversy, Ch. 39 "The Time of Trouble"). This experience isn't about earning salvation, but reflecting the character of Christ through complete reliance on Him.

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

*   **Summary:** We've seen God's pattern: He allows challenges that seem impossible (Ex 14:1-10), calls us to trust Him explicitly ("Fear not, stand still" - Ex 14:13), commands active obedience ("Go forward" - Ex 14:15), and delivers powerfully (Ex 14:21-31), leading to worship (Ex 15:1-2) and witness (Ex 15:14).
*   **The Principle Endures:** This isn't just ancient history. God still works this way. He is "able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think" (Eph 3:20) when we trust and obey.
*   **Actionable Steps (Derived from the Text):**
    1.  **Identify Your 'Red Sea':** This week, name one specific situation where you feel trapped or overwhelmed.
    2.  **Choose Faith over Fear (Ex 14:13):** Consciously pray, "Lord, I choose to trust You in this, even though I don't see the way." Write down Exodus 14:14 ("The Lord shall fight for you...") and place it where you'll see it.
    3.  **Listen for the "Go Forward" (Ex 14:15):** Ask God in prayer and Bible study for His specific instruction for *your* next step of obedience in that situation, however small or illogical it seems.
    4.  **Prepare to Worship & Witness (Ex 15:1-2, 14):** Decide now that when God acts, your first response will be praise, and you will look for opportunities to share how He worked.
*   **Invitation:** We all face Red Seas. Perhaps you're facing one right now. The same God who parted the waters for Israel is *your* God (1 Tim 4:10). Will you choose today to stop looking back in fear and start looking up in faith? Will you listen for His command to "go forward," trusting that He *will* make a way, just as He promised? Let's commit our impossible situations to Him right now, believing He will fight for us and lead us through.
