  chances, rooted in His unchanging character.

  his way and live" (Ezekiel 33:11).

### God's Character: The Foundation of Hope (10 min)

- **God's Heart Revealed:** Focus on _why_ second chances are possible – it's
  who God IS.
  - **No Pleasure in Loss:** Ezekiel 33:11 - God desires repentance and life,
    not death. `[Whiteboard: Ezek 33:11 - God desires LIFE]`
  - **Rich in Mercy:** Ephesians 2:4-5 - Because of His great love, God, who is
    "rich in mercy," makes us alive with Christ even when we were dead in sins.
    **(RQ)** What does 'rich in mercy' mean practically?
    `[Whiteboard: Eph 2:4 - MERCY = God's Default]`
  - **Abundant Mercy:** 1 Peter 1:3 - According to His "abundant mercy," He has
    begotten us again unto a _living hope_ through Christ's resurrection.
  - **Enduring Loving-kindness:** Psalm 136 (mention refrain) - His mercy
    endures forever. It's not temporary or conditional on our perfection.
- **Key Takeaway:** God isn't looking for reasons to condemn; He's actively
  looking for ways to save and restore because of His love and mercy.

### Biblical Portraits of Restoration (12 min) [*]

- **God's Pattern:** Show, don't just tell. God consistently offers restoration.
  - **Jonah:** Ran from God's call, yet God gave a second command: "Arise, go
    unto Nineveh... and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee" (Jonah
    3:1-2). God also relented from disaster for Nineveh upon their repentance
    (Jonah 3:10). `[Whiteboard: Jonah 3:1 - Second Command]`
    - **(RQ)** What does Jonah's story teach us about God's persistence and
      willingness to use flawed people?
  - **Other Examples (Briefly):**
    - _Abraham:_ Despite failures like lying about Sarah (Gen 12 & 20), his
      faith was counted for righteousness, and he was called the 'friend of God'
      (James 2:23).
    - _David:_ Committed terrible sins like adultery and murder (2 Sam 11), yet
      after deep repentance (Psalm 51), God still called him 'a man after mine
      own heart' (Acts 13:22).
    - _Paul:_ A violent persecutor of the church (Acts 8-9), yet transformed by
      grace into the chief apostle to the Gentiles.
- **Shifting Focus:** Philippians 3:13-14 - Paul's example: "Forgetting those
  things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are
  before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
  Christ Jesus."
  - `[Whiteboard: Phil 3:13-14 - Forget Past -> Press Forward]`
  - **(RQ)** How does dwelling on past failures hinder our 'pressing toward the
    mark'?
  - **Focus on Potential:** Our identity is not defined by past sin, but found
    in Christ's righteousness and His ongoing plan for us.
  - `[Aside: Our past failures, when surrendered to Christ, don't disqualify us; they become part of the testimony of His incredible grace. Like scars that tell a story of healing, not defeat.]`

### Receiving Your Second Chance (12 min)

- **God's Invitation, Our Response:** How do we access this restoration?
  - **For the Unbeliever (A New Start):** God outlines clear steps for receiving
    this new beginning:
    - _Belief:_ It starts with faith, trusting that God exists and rewards those
      who diligently seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).
    - _Repentance:_ God now "commandeth all men every where to repent"—to turn
      away from sin towards Him (Acts 17:30).
      `[Whiteboard: REPENT (Acts 17:30) = Turn Around]`
    - _Confession:_ We must acknowledge Christ openly before others, as He
      promises, "Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
      confess also before my Father which is in heaven" (Matthew 10:32).
    - _Baptism:_ This outward symbol signifies our inward cleansing and
      commitment, linked by Jesus to salvation: "He that believeth and is
      baptized shall be saved" (Mark 16:16).
    - _Faithfulness/Obedience:_ The journey continues by remaining faithful,
      even unto death, to receive the promised crown of life (Revelation 2:10).
    - `[Whiteboard: Steps to New Life: Belief (Heb 11:6), Repentance (Acts 17:30), Confession (Matt 10:32), Baptism (Mark 16:16), Faithfulness (Rev 2:10)]`
  - **For the Believer Who Has Strayed (Restoration):**
    - _The Promise:_ 1 John 1:9 - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and
      just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
      `[Whiteboard: 1 John 1:9 - Confess -> Forgiven + Cleansed]`
    - **(RQ)** What's the difference between forgiveness (dealing with guilt)
      and cleansing (dealing with the impurity/power of sin) here?
    - _God's Eagerness:_ Luke 15:20 - The Father saw the prodigal son "when he
      was yet a great way off, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his
      neck, and kissed him." God doesn't wait grudgingly; He eagerly welcomes us
      back.
    - `[Analogy (from Luke 15): God's porch light is always on for the returning child. He runs to meet us.]`
- **Integral to Character:** Repentance and faithful living aren't just entry
  points; they are the ongoing process of sanctification and character
  development. God uses the 'second chance' to refine us more into His image.
  - `[Aside: True repentance isn't just saying sorry; it's a change of mind (metanoia) that leads to a change of direction, empowered by God's grace. It's aligning our will back with His loving plan for our character.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** God's very nature is mercy (Eph 2:4). He desires restoration, not
  condemnation (Ezek 33:11). We see this pattern throughout Scripture (Jonah,
  David, Paul). We access this new beginning or restoration through specific
  biblical steps like repentance and confession (Acts 17:30, 1 John 1:9).
- **Key Message Refocus:** Don't let past failures define your present or
  future. In Christ, forget what is behind and press forward to what God has for
  you (Phil 3:13-14).
- **God's Heart:** Reiterate God's eagerness to forgive and restore, running to
  meet the repentant heart (Luke 15:20). He is waiting with open arms.
- **Connection to Character:** Embracing God's second chance is vital for
  character development, allowing Him to cleanse and shape us into the people He
  created us to be.
- **Gentle Appeal:**
  - If you've never started your walk with God, respond to His call today
    through belief, repentance, confession, and baptism (Acts 2:38, Mark 16:16).
  - If you've strayed, come home. Confess your sins; He IS faithful and just to
    forgive and cleanse you completely (1 John 1:9).
  - **(RQ)** Will you accept the second chance, the restoration, God is offering
    you right now?
- **Final Prayer:** Prayer for acceptance of God's mercy, forgiveness,
  cleansing, and the strength to walk in newness of life according to His Word.
