### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Who is God to you? Judge? Creator? King? Friend? ...Father? **(RQ)**
- Introduce Isaiah 9:6 - Jesus, the Son, is called "Everlasting Father." How can
  this be? **(RQ)**
- Thesis: Through Jesus Christ, the Son who perfectly reveals the Father, we can
  know God intimately as _our_ loving, Everlasting Father, because He legally
  adopts us as His own children.
- `[Write on board: Title - The Everlasting Father: Adopted into God's Family]`

### Section 1: The Promise & Provision of Fatherhood (10 min)

- **Point:** God's plan included revealing His Father-heart through His Son.
- **Scripture:** Isaiah 9:6 - "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is
  given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
  called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The
  Prince of Peace."
- **Explanation:** Jesus embodies the Father's eternal nature, love, and
  authority. He came to show us the Father (John 14:9).
  `[Whiteboard: Isa 9:6 -> Jesus = Revelation of the Father's Heart]`
- **Point:** Access to this Father-child relationship requires receiving Christ.
- **Scripture:** John 1:12 - "But as many as received him, to them gave he power
  [Greek: *exousia* - authority, right] to become the sons of God, even to them
  that believe on his name:"
- **Explanation:** It's not automatic by birth. Believing in/receiving Jesus
  grants the _divine right_ to enter God's family.
  `[Whiteboard: John 1:12 -> Receive Christ = Right to be Children]`
- **(RQ):** Seeing Jesus as the embodiment of the "Everlasting Father," how does
  that change our perception of God's character?

### Section 2: The Legal Reality: Adoption Explained [*] (12 min)

- **Point:** Our adoption was God's eternal plan, rooted in His love.
- **Scripture:** Ephesians 1:4-5 - "According as he hath chosen us in him before
  the foundation of the world... Having predestinated us unto the adoption of
  children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his
  will,"
- **Explanation:** Adoption isn't Plan B. It was God's loving intention from
  eternity, accomplished _through_ Jesus.
  `[Whiteboard: Eph 1:5 -> Adoption = God's Eternal Purpose]`
- **Point:** Adoption is legally secured by Christ's redemption.
- **Scripture:** Galatians 4:4-7 - "But when the fulness of the time was come,
  God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, To redeem them
  that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. And
  because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your
  hearts, crying, Abba, Father. Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son;
  and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
- **Explanation:** Jesus paid the price (redeemed) to free us from sin's
  condemnation ('under the law') and grant us full legal status as
  sons/daughters.
  `[Draw arrow: Redemption (Gal 4:5) -> Adoption -> Heirship (Gal 4:7)]`
- **Connection:** This legal status changes everything – from slave to sin, to
  heir of God! This reality must shape how we live.
- `[Aside: Think about earthly adoption – a legal act bringing someone into a family with all rights and privileges. God's adoption is infinitely more profound, securing eternal inheritance and changing our very nature through His Spirit.]`
- **(RQ):** Galatians 4:7 says we are "no more a servant, but a son; and if a
  son, then an heir of God through Christ." How should knowing our _legal
  status_ as heirs impact our daily confidence and approach to God?

### Section 3: The Relational Reality: Sons & Daughters (12 min)

- **Point:** Adoption isn't just legal; it's deeply relational, empowered by the
  Holy Spirit.
- **Scripture:** Romans 8:15 - "For ye have not received the spirit of bondage
  again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,
  Abba, Father."
- **Explanation:** The same Spirit that confirms our adoption enables intimate
  communication. "Abba" is an Aramaic term of endearment, like "Daddy" or "Papa"
  – expressing closeness, trust, and dependence, not fear.
  `[Whiteboard: Rom 8:15 -> Spirit of Adoption vs. Spirit of Bondage/Fear]`
- **Point:** The Spirit within us confirms our identity as God's children.
- **Scripture:** Galatians 4:6 - "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth
  the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father." (Connect back
  to Rom 8:15)
- **Explanation:** The inner cry of "Abba" is evidence of the Spirit's presence
  and our true sonship. It's not something we conjure up; it's Spirit-prompted.
- **Illustration:** Imagine a child lost in a crowd, crying "Mommy!" or "Daddy!"
  It's an instinctive cry for the one they belong to. The Spirit prompts a
  similar instinctive cry in us towards our Heavenly Father.
- **Point:** Recognizing God's love as our Father transforms our
  self-perception.
- **Scripture:** 1 John 3:1 - "Behold what manner of love the Father hath
  bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the
  world knoweth us not, because it knew him not."
- **Explanation:** Meditate on the _kind_ and _magnitude_ of love required for
  the Holy God to call us, former sinners, His children! This identity is our
  true reality, even if the world doesn't recognize it.
  `[Whiteboard: 1 John 3:1 -> Father's Love -> Our Identity = Sons/Daughters]`
- **(RQ):** How does understanding the _Spirit's_ role in crying "Abba, Father"
  (Rom 8:15, Gal 4:6) change how we approach prayer?

### Conclusion & Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** We've seen God's Father-heart revealed in Jesus (Isa 9:6), the
  legal reality of our adoption secured by Christ's redemption (Gal 4:4-7, Eph
  1:5), and the relational intimacy we have through the Spirit, enabling us to
  cry "Abba, Father" (Rom 8:15, 1 John 3:1).
- **Need/Question (from text):** Knowing we are legally adopted and have the
  Spirit, how do we _live_ like beloved children instead of fearful slaves or
  distant orphans? (Ref Rom 8:15)
- **Biblical Principle (from text):** We have received the "Spirit of adoption,"
  which frees us from fear and empowers intimate relationship with God as "Abba,
  Father." (Rom 8:15)
- **Bridging (from text):** In daily life, anxieties, failures, and worldly
  pressures can make us forget our true identity. We might revert to relating to
  God out of fear or duty ('spirit of bondage'). But Romans 8:15 calls us to
  live from the reality of our adoption – secure, loved, and free to approach
  our Father with childlike trust.
- **Actionable Steps (from text):**
  1.  **Pray "Abba":** Consciously begin prayers this week addressing God as
      "Abba" or "Father," reflecting the intimacy granted by the Spirit (Rom
      8:15, Gal 4:6).
  2.  **Reject Fear with Truth:** When feelings of fear or condemnation arise,
      verbally remind yourself: "I have received the Spirit of adoption, not
      bondage to fear. I am a child of God." (Rom 8:15).
  3.  **Thank Him for His Love:** Take a moment each day to specifically thank
      God for the "manner of love" He bestowed in calling you His child (1 John
      3:1).
- **Invitation:** Will you embrace your identity today? Will you live not in
  fear, but in the freedom and intimacy of being a beloved child of the
  Everlasting Father, crying "Abba" through His Spirit? Let His love define who
  you are.
