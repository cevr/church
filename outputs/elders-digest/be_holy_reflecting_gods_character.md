### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: The startling command - "Be Holy." **(RQ)** What does this ancient
  command mean for us, living centuries later?
- Introduce Central Verse: Leviticus 19:2 - God's own reason: "_for I_ the Lord
  your God am holy."
- [Whiteboard: Title - Be Holy: Reflecting God's Character]
- [Whiteboard: Central Verse - Lev 19:2]
- Roadmap: We'll explore:
  1.  What God's holiness _is_.
  2.  How reverence was taught (and required).
  3.  How the Old Testament pointed to Christ.
  4.  How _we_ are called to holiness and how it's possible.

### Main Content 1: The Awesome Holiness of God (10 min)

- **Defining God's Holiness:**
  - More than just moral purity; it's His essential nature: Separate, Other,
    Transcendent, Perfect Light. (Isaiah 6:3 - "Holy, holy, holy"; Habakkuk
    1:13 - "Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil...")
  - [Whiteboard: GOD'S HOLINESS = Separate + Pure + Perfect Light (Isa 6:3)]
- **The Need for Reverence:**
  - A holy God cannot be approached casually or on human terms.
  - Case Study: Nadab & Abihu (Leviticus 10:1-3).
    - The Incident: Offered "strange fire" - unauthorized, disobedient worship.
    - The Consequence: Immediate judgment, demonstrating the danger of
      presumption.
    - The Lesson (Lev 10:3): God _will be_ sanctified (regarded as holy) by
      those who come near Him.
    - [Whiteboard: Lev 10:1-3 -> Reverence & Obedience Required]
  - **(RQ)** How does our modern culture's emphasis on casualness clash with the
    biblical call for reverence before a Holy God (Heb 12:28-29)?

### Main Content 2: From Shadows to Substance [*] (10 min)

- **The Levitical System: God's Visual Aid:**
  - Purpose: To teach about sin's seriousness, God's holiness, and the provision
    for atonement.
  - Elements: Sacrifices, priests, sanctuary rituals (Brief mention).
  - Nature: These were "a shadow of good things to come" (Hebrews 10:1), types
    pointing forward.
  - [Whiteboard: Draw simple diagram: OT System (Leviticus) = Shadow -> Pointing
    to -> Christ = Substance (Heb 10:1)]
- **The Substance: Jesus Christ:**
  - Fulfillment: His life, death, and resurrection fulfilled the types.
  - Perfect Sacrifice: Once for all, achieving what animal sacrifices couldn't
    (Heb 10:4, 10-12).
  - High Priest: Our access point to God (Heb 4:14-16).
  - New Access: Boldness to enter the Holiest _by the blood of Jesus_ (Hebrews
    10:19-22).
  - [Whiteboard: Heb 10:19-22 -> Bold Access THROUGH Christ's Blood]
  - **(RQ)** If the _shadows_ demanded such careful reverence (Lev 10), how
    should we approach God now, having access through the _substance_, Christ
    Himself?
- [Aside: Like spiritual embassies...] _"Our church buildings represent our
  collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual
  embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the
  customs of the surrounding culture."_ (Connects reverence/holiness to our
  collective spaces/witness).

### Main Content 3: The Call to Be Holy & Transformed (12 min)

- **The Command Stands:**
  - Not just Old Testament: Directly applied to believers by Peter (1 Peter
    1:15-16, quoting Lev 19:2).
  - Scope: "Be ye holy in _all manner of conversation_ (conduct)."
  - [Whiteboard: Lev 19:2 -> 1 Peter 1:15-16 -> Holiness in ALL Conduct]
- **Holiness is Non-Negotiable:**
  - Essential for relationship with God: "Follow...holiness, without which no
    man shall see the Lord" (Hebrews 12:14).
  - **(RQ)** What does Hebrews 12:14 tell us about the seriousness of pursuing a
    holy life?
- **The Transformation Process:**
  - The Reality of Sin: We were disqualified (1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - list
    examples).
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 6:9-10 -> Sin Disqualifies]
  - The Divine Solution: God's work through Christ and the Spirit (1 Corinthians
    6:11).
    - Washed: Cleansed by Christ's blood.
    - Sanctified: Set apart for God, made holy positionally and progressively.
    - Justified: Declared righteous through faith in Jesus.
  - [Whiteboard: 1 Cor 6:11 -> Washed + Sanctified + Justified = God's
    Transformation (by Christ/Spirit)]
  - [Analogy (from 1 Cor 6:11): Like a polluted stream being purified at the
    source (Christ) and flowing clean.]
- **Practical Steps Derived from Scripture:**
  - 1.  **Pursue** it actively (Hebrews 12:14) - Requires intentional effort.
  - 2.  **Rely** on God's power (1 Cor 6:11; Phil 2:13) - It's His work _in_ us.
  - 3.  **Reflect** His character daily (1 Peter 1:15; Gal 5:22-23) - Choices in
        speech, actions, thoughts.
  - [Whiteboard: Action Steps: 1. Pursue (Heb 12:14), 2. Rely (1 Cor 6:11), 3.
    Reflect (1 Pet 1:15)]
- [Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom...] _"Instead of spending on
  ourselves, we can use this season to demonstrate Christ's self-sacrificing
  love to others. It's like finding a coin on the ground—even though it came
  from a worldly system, we can put it to work for God's kingdom. December
  offers open doors for sharing truth that might otherwise remain closed."_
  (Connects practical choices/stewardship to reflecting God's holy character).

  - God IS absolutely Holy (Lev 19:2).
