### Introduction (5 min)
- Welcome & Opening Prayer
- Introduce the concept: What does true dedication to God's work look like?
- **(RQ)** In an age of distraction, how focused are we on our divine commission?
- Briefly introduce George Whitefield as a historical *illustration* of tireless gospel labor (not the focus, but an example of principles we'll study in Scripture).
    - Mention his extensive preaching schedule, commitment despite opposition.
- State the study's aim: To explore the *biblical foundation* for unwavering dedication in service to Christ, especially in these last days.
- Read Central Verse: Colossians 3:23-24.
- `[Whiteboard: Dedication = Heartily, As to the Lord (Col 3:23)]`

### Section 1: The Biblical Mandate for Hearty Service (10 min)
- **Focus:** Understanding the *motivation* and *standard* for Christian service from Colossians 3:23-24.
- **Unpack Colossians 3:23:** "Whatsoever ye do..."
    - **(RQ)** Does this apply only to "religious" activities, or *everything*? (Context: verses 17, 22)
    - "...do it heartily..."
        - `[Whiteboard: Heartily = Greek 'ek psyches' - from the soul/whole being]`
        - Contrast with half-hearted or obligatory service.
    - "...as to the Lord, and not unto men."
        - The ultimate accountability and audience.
        - **(RQ)** How does remembering we serve Christ change our approach to daily tasks or church responsibilities?
- **Unpack Colossians 3:24:** "Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward..."
    - The motivation is not earthly praise but heavenly reward (inheritance).
    - "...for ye serve the Lord Christ."
        - Reinforces the primary relationship.
- **Connecting Principle:** Our service, in *any* capacity, is an act of worship and allegiance to Christ when done with full commitment.
- `[Brief Illustration Concept (from verse): Like an employee working diligently even when the boss isn't watching, knowing the ultimate owner sees and rewards.]`

### Section 2: Urgency and the Evangelistic Call [*] (12 min)
- **Focus:** Linking dedication to the specific call to proclaim the gospel, especially in light of the end times.
- **Transition:** This 'hearty service' finds urgent expression in sharing the Gospel.
- **Examine 2 Timothy 4:2, 5:** Paul's charge to Timothy.
    - "Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season..."
        - `[Whiteboard: Instant = Ready, Persistent (2 Tim 4:2)]`
        - **(RQ)** What does it mean to be ready 'out of season'? When it's inconvenient? Unpopular?
    - "...do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."
        - A call to active proclamation and fulfilling one's God-given role.
- **Connect to Matthew 24:14:** The scope and sign of the end.
    - "...this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness..."
    - `[Whiteboard: Gospel -> All the World -> Witness -> The End (Matt 24:14)]`
    - **(RQ)** How does this global mandate inform our personal sense of urgency and dedication?
- **Connect to Revelation 14:6-7:** The Three Angels' Messages.
    - "...having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth..."
    - The final, urgent call: Fear God, give glory, worship the Creator.
    - This is the specific 'word' to be preached 'in season and out of season' today.
- **Historical Illustration Link:** Whitefield's life exemplified this urgency – preaching constantly, driven by the need to share the gospel message.
- `[Aside: Our modern communication tools offer unprecedented ways to be 'instant in season,' sharing the everlasting gospel far wider than Whitefield could dream. Are we using these tools 'heartily, as unto the Lord'?]`

### Section 3: Running the Race with Endurance (12 min)
- **Focus:** The need for perseverance and disciplined effort in our dedicated service.
- **Transition:** Dedication isn't just intensity, but sustained effort.
- **Examine 1 Corinthians 9:24-27:** Paul's analogy of the race.
    - "So run, that ye may obtain."
        - Requires purpose, direction, effort.
    - "...temperate in all things... I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection..."
        - `[Whiteboard: Run to Win (1 Cor 9:24) -> Requires Discipline (v. 25, 27)]`
        - Discipline and self-control are essential for sustained, effective service.
        - **(RQ)** What 'weights' or distractions (Heb 12:1) hinder our spiritual race today?
- **Connect back to 2 Timothy 4:5, 7:** "Endure afflictions... I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith."
    - Dedication involves perseverance through hardship.
    - Paul's testimony reflects the goal: finishing faithfully.
- **Historical Illustration Link:** Whitefield faced opposition, physical exhaustion, but endured – he 'ran his race' to the finish.
- **Practical Application:**
    - **Need:** The tendency to start strong but fade (Parable of Sower - Matt 13).
    - **Biblical Principle:** Endurance and discipline are vital for finishing the course (1 Cor 9:24-27, 2 Tim 4:5, Heb 12:1-2).
    - **Bridge:** Just as an athlete trains, we need spiritual disciplines (prayer, study, Sabbath rest) to sustain our service.
    - `[Whiteboard: Action Steps: 1. Identify your 'race' (God's call). 2. Practice daily discipline (prayer/study - cf. Dan 6:10). 3. Seek God's strength in hardship (Phil 4:13).]`
- `[Aside: Sometimes the 'afflictions' we endure (2 Tim 4:5) aren't dramatic persecutions, but the daily grind of faithfulness, the quiet battle against apathy, or the struggle to prioritize kingdom work amidst worldly demands. Endurance here is just as crucial.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)
- **Recap:** We are called by Scripture to serve God 'heartily' (Col 3:23), with urgent dedication to proclaiming the everlasting gospel (Matt 24:14, Rev 14:6-7), requiring disciplined endurance to finish our race faithfully (1 Cor 9:24-27, 2 Tim 4:7).
- **Revisit Whitefield:** His life serves as a powerful *illustration* of these biblical principles in action – a testament to what God can do through a fully surrendered life.
- **The Core Truth:** True dedication flows not from human effort alone, but from a heart transformed by Christ and empowered by the Holy Spirit, focused on serving Him above all.
- **(RQ)** Seeing the biblical standard and the need of the hour, how will we respond?
- **Invitation:**
    - Invitation to commit/recommit to serving God wholeheartedly in whatever capacity He calls.
    - Invitation to embrace the urgency of the Three Angels' Messages.
    - Invitation to seek God's strength for endurance.
- Closing Prayer: Asking for the Holy Spirit's power for dedicated, faithful service until Christ's return.
