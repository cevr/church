### Introduction (5 min)

- **Hook:** Acknowledge common concerns/observations about challenges within the
  church today (lukewarmness, division, etc.) – symptoms Christ Himself
  addresses (Rev 3:15-16).
- **Topic Intro:** The urgent need for _divine_ renewal in our church, initiated
  by Christ who stands knocking (Rev 3:20).
- **Objective:** Examine the biblical call for renewal, face challenges honestly
  as described in Revelation 3, reaffirm God's promises for His church (Matt
  16:18), and commit to personal/corporate faithfulness through transformation
  (Rom 12:1-2).
- **Central Verse Focus:** Christ stands at the door (Rev 3:20) - a personal
  _and_ corporate invitation to let Him in for intimate fellowship ("sup with
  him") and renewal.
  `[Whiteboard: Rev 3:20 - Christ at the Door: Personal & Corporate Invitation]`

### Section 1: The Church's Divine Foundation & Enduring Hope (10 min)

- **Point:** Christ established His church with an unbreakable promise.
  - **Scripture:** Matthew 16:18 - "And I say also unto thee, That thou art
    Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell
    shall not prevail against it."
  - **Explanation:** The Church belongs to Christ ("my church"), built on the
    foundational truth of Himself ("this rock"), not human effort. Its ultimate
    victory ("shall not prevail") is assured by Him.
    `[Whiteboard: Matt 16:18 - Christ's Church -> Unshakable Promise]`
  - **RQ:** Despite visible struggles (like those in Rev 3), do we live like we
    truly believe Christ's promise that the "gates of hell shall not prevail
    against" _His_ church? **(RQ)**
- **Point:** Christ promises His empowering presence.
  - **Scripture:** Matthew 18:20 - "For where two or three are gathered together
    in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
  - **Explanation:** His presence ("there am I") is the source of the church's
    true life, authority, and power, not numbers or programs. This is the
    presence we invite when we open the door (Rev 3:20).
    `[Whiteboard: Matt 18:20 - Christ's Presence = Life & Power]`
- **Connection:** This divine foundation (Matt 16:18) and promised presence
  (Matt 18:20) provide solid hope amidst the necessary, sometimes painful,
  process of purification and renewal described in Revelation 3.

### Section 2: The Reality of Our Condition & The Call to Repentance [*] (12 min)

- **Point:** Acknowledging the Need - The Laodicean Diagnosis.
  - **Scripture:** Revelation 3:15-19 - Christ's assessment: Lukewarmness
    ("neither cold nor hot," v.15-16), self-deception ("I am rich... and have
    need of nothing," v.17), yet the true condition is "wretched, and miserable,
    and poor, and blind, and naked" (v.17).
  - **Explanation:** Connect this specific diagnosis (Rev 3:15-17) to modern
    church issues: spiritual apathy (lukewarmness), divisions (often rooted in
    self-sufficiency vs. dependence on Christ), inconsistency, perceived
    irrelevancy stemming from lacking true spiritual riches.
    `[Whiteboard: Rev 3:15-19 -> Lukewarm -> Need: Gold (Faith/Love), Raiment (Christ's Righteousness), Eyesalve (Spiritual Discernment) - ALL bought from Christ (v.18)]`
  - **RQ:** Reading Rev 3:15-17, where do we see these specific characteristics
    ("lukewarm," "need of nothing," yet "poor, blind, naked") personally or
    corporately today? **(RQ)**
  - **EGW Insight Concept:** The biblical principle of purification (echoed in
    EGW) is explicit in Christ's counsel: "I counsel thee to buy of me gold
    tried in the fire... white raiment... anoint thine eyes with eyesalve..."
    (Rev 3:18). This "buying" involves repentance and receiving His provision, a
    refining process ("as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten," v.19).
- **Point:** The Danger of Worldliness Identified in Scripture.
  - **Scripture:** Romans 12:2a - "And be not conformed to this world..."
  - **Explanation:** This command directly addresses the tendency (seen in
    Laodicea's self-sufficiency, Rev 3:17) to adopt the world's thinking,
    values, entertainment, and priorities instead of being transformed by God.
    Link this "conformity" to lack of reverence, seeking cultural relevance over
    biblical faithfulness.
    `[Write Question on Board: How does 'conformity to this world' (Rom 12:2) manifest the 'lukewarm' state (Rev 3:16)?]`
  - **Aside:** _"Our church gatherings should reflect the reality of Christ's
    presence (Matt 18:20). They are like spiritual embassies—territory meant to
    represent the kingdom of heaven, not merely mirror the customs of the
    surrounding culture."_ `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies...]`

### Section 3: The Path to Renewal: Transformation & Action (12 min)

- **Point:** Renewal Begins with Individual Surrender and Transformation.
  - **Scripture:** Romans 12:1-2 - "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
    mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
    acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed
    to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind..."
  - **Explanation:** True renewal isn't superficial changes but a complete
    yielding ("living sacrifice," v.1) leading to inner transformation
    ("renewing of your mind," v.2) by God's Spirit through His Word. This is the
    direct antidote to worldly conformity (v.2) and the path away from
    lukewarmness (Rev 3:16).
    `[Whiteboard: Rom 12:1-2 -> Living Sacrifice (Total Surrender) -> Renewed Mind -> Transformation (Antidote to Rev 3:16)]`
- **Point:** The Necessity of Dying to Self for Spiritual Fruitfulness.
  - **Scripture:** John 12:24 - "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn
    of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it
    bringeth forth much fruit."
  - **Explanation:** Self-interest, pride, personal preferences ("abideth
    alone") must be surrendered ('die') for Christ's life, love, unity, and
    mission ('fruit') to flourish. This 'dying' is part of becoming a 'living
    sacrifice' (Rom 12:1) and overcomes the self-sufficient spirit of Laodicea
    (Rev 3:17).
    `[Analogy (from verse): Seed must 'die' (be buried, break open) to produce life; self must yield ('die,' John 12:24) for spiritual fruitfulness.]`
- **Point:** The Defining Mark of Renewal: Christ-like Love.
  - **Scripture:** John 13:34 - "A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love
    one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another."
  - **Explanation:** This specific, sacrificial love ("as I have loved you") is
    the primary evidence of true discipleship and genuine renewal (cf. the "gold
    tried in the fire" which includes love, Rev 3:18). It directly impacts how
    we interact within the church body, moving from potential division (implied
    in lukewarmness) to active unity.
- **Practical Application (Bridging Rom 12, John 13:34, John 12:24, Rev 3:19):**
  What does bringing a 'renewed self' (Rom 12:1-2) who is 'dying to self' (John
  12:24) and 'loving others' (John 13:34) look like in response to Christ's call
  (Rev 3:19-20)?
  - `[Whiteboard: Action Steps for Renewal (Based on Rom 12, John 13:34, John 12:24, Rev 3:19)]`
  - **Be Zealous & Repent (Rev 3:19):** Actively turn from specific areas of
    lukewarmness identified earlier. Make a conscious decision to prioritize
    spiritual things.
  - **Present Yourself as a Living Sacrifice (Rom 12:1):** Come prepared for
    worship, focused on God, not just attending. Offer your time and attention
    fully.
  - **Use Your Gifts in Service (Rom 12:6-8):** Identify how God has gifted you
    and actively use those gifts within the church body as part of the 'living
    sacrifice'.
  - **Practice Christ-like Love (John 13:34):** Intentionally show kindness,
    forbearance, and active helpfulness to fellow members, especially those you
    differ with ("as I have loved you").
  - **Embrace 'Dying to Self' for Unity (John 12:24):** Willingly set aside
    personal preferences (in non-essential matters) for the sake of harmony and
    the church's mission.
  - **RQ:** Based on Rom 12:1 ("living sacrifice") and John 13:34 ("love one
    another as I have loved you"), what _one specific action_ can you take this
    week to actively build up, rather than conform, within our church community?
    **(RQ)**

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:** Christ guarantees His church's ultimate victory (Matt 16:18) and
  offers His presence (Matt 18:20). Yet, He lovingly diagnoses our Laodicean
  condition (Rev 3:15-17) and calls us to repent and be zealous (Rev 3:19),
  leading to deep, transformative renewal (Rom 12:1-2) through surrender (John
  12:24) and active love (John 13:34).
- **Revisit Central Verse:** Christ is still knocking (Rev 3:20). The call is
  personal ("if any man hear") and urgent. Will we open the door to His renewing
  power and intimate fellowship ("sup with him")?
  `[Point to Whiteboard: Rev 3:20 - Will YOU open the door?]`
- **Urgency:** Emphasize the shortness of time, the nearness of Christ's return,
  and the need for the church to be a faithful witness, not lukewarm (Rev 3:16).
- **Appeal:** A call for personal commitment based on the texts studied:
  - To heed Christ's counsel: repent and be zealous (Rev 3:19).
  - To seek genuine daily surrender as a 'living sacrifice' (Rom 12:1).
  - To embrace the 'death' of self that leads to fruitfulness (John 12:24).
  - To actively build up the church body through Christ-like love and service
    (John 13:34, Rom 12:6-8).
- **Final Affirmation:** Despite challenges, Christ _is_ purifying a people (Rev
  3:18-19). Through His grace, let us cooperate with Him ("if any man hear my
  voice, and open the door," Rev 3:20) in the vital work of renewing His church,
  starting with ourselves.
