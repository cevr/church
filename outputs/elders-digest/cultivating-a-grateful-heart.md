### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Start with a common scenario of forgetting to say 'thank you' or feeling
  unappreciated. Transition to spiritual gratitude.
- The Problem: Ingratitude is common, even among believers. Why?
- The Goal: Explore the biblical mandate and method for cultivating a grateful
  heart.
- Central Verse Introduction: 1 Thessalonians 5:18 - God's will for us.
- Outline Preview: We'll look at the story of the lepers (Luke 17), understand
  the roots of ingratitude, and find practical steps from Scripture.

### Section 1: The Lepers' Lesson - Gratitude Directed (Luke 17:11-19) (12 min)

- **The Need:** Ten lepers, desperate outcasts (Luke 17:11-13). Their cry:
  "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us." [Whiteboard: Leprosy = Sin/Separation]
- **The Command & Faith:** Jesus' instruction: "Go shew yourselves unto the
  priests." (Luke 17:14a). Faith required _before_ seeing the result. What did
  they have to believe? **(RQ)**
- **The Action & Blessing:** "And it came to pass, that, _as they went_, they
  were cleansed." (Luke 17:14b). [Whiteboard: Faith (Heb 11:1) -> Action
  (Obedience) -> Blessing (Healing)]
- **The Response - The One:** Only one returned, glorifying God (Luke 17:15). A
  Samaritan - an outsider! Why him? **(RQ)** He fell down _at Jesus' feet_,
  giving thanks (Luke 17:16). Gratitude directed to the Source.
- **The Response - The Nine:** Jesus' poignant questions: "Were there not ten
  cleansed? but where are the nine? There are not found that returned to give
  glory to God, save this stranger." (Luke 17:17-18). [Write Question on board:
  Where are the nine?] What does this reveal about God's expectation? **(RQ)**
- **The Principle:** True gratitude recognizes God as the Giver and returns
  praise directly to Him.

### Section 2: Faith, Ingratitude, and Grace [*] (12 min)

- **Faith Acts First:** Connect the lepers' faith (acting before seeing) to the
  definition in Hebrews 11:1. It wasn't feeling; it was obedience based on
  Christ's word.
- **Roots of Ingratitude:**
  - Taking Blessings for Granted: Forgetting the Giver amidst the gifts (Deut
    8:11-14). [Analogy: Like breathing air – essential, constant, yet often
    unacknowledged until restricted].
  - Self-Attribution/Coincidence: Crediting self, circumstances, or luck (Dan
    4:30 - Nebuchadnezzar's pride). How often do our thoughts subtly echo "_My_
    power and the might of _mine_ hand hath gotten me this wealth"? (Deut 8:17)
    **(RQ)**
- **Grace Appreciation:** Recognizing our spiritual leprosy (sinfulness - Rom
  3:23, Eph 2:1-5) enhances gratitude for God's unmerited favor (grace). The
  lepers knew their desperate state. Do we truly grasp ours apart from Christ?
  **(RQ)** [Whiteboard: Our State (Eph 2:1) -> God's Grace (Eph 2:4-5) ->
  Gratitude]
- [Aside: Like the healed leper, recognizing our spiritual uncleanness before
  Christ makes His cleansing grace infinitely precious. We were outcasts, He
  brought us near through His sacrifice. This realization fuels genuine
  thanksgiving.]

### Section 3: Cultivating Gratitude - Hope and Practice (10 min)

- **The Hope Factor:** Focusing on our heavenly hope puts earthly trials into
  perspective (Col 3:1-2). "Set your affection on things above, not on things on
  the earth." How does an eternal perspective change our view of temporary
  troubles? **(RQ)** [Whiteboard: Earthly Focus (Complaints) vs. Heavenly Focus
  (Gratitude - Col 3:1-2)]
- **Practical Steps from Scripture:**
  - **Conscious Counting:** "Giving thanks _always_ for _all things_ unto God"
    (Eph 5:20). Intentionally list blessings – spiritual (salvation,
    forgiveness, Holy Spirit, truth) and material (health, provision,
    relationships). [Action Step: This week, start a daily gratitude list – 3
    specific things].
  - **Balanced Prayer:** "Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer
    and supplication _with thanksgiving_ let your requests be made known unto
    God." (Phil 4:6). [Whiteboard: Prayer = Requests + Thanksgiving (Phil 4:6)].
    Is our prayer life more 'give me' or 'thank You'? **(RQ)** [Action Step:
    Before making requests in prayer, consciously thank God for 3 specific
    answers or blessings].
  - **Entering with Praise:** "Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into
    his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name." (Psalm
    100:4). [Brief Illustration Concept (from Ps 100:4): Gratitude is the 'key'
    or 'password' to joyfully entering God's presence, shifting our focus from
    problems to Provider].

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Recap:**
  - Gratitude must be directed to God, the Giver (Luke 17).
  - Faith acts on God's Word, often before seeing results.
  - Ingratitude stems from forgetting, pride, or taking grace for granted.
  - Recognizing sinfulness and focusing on heavenly hope fuels gratitude.
  - We can cultivate gratitude through conscious practice (listing, balanced
    prayer - Eph 5:20, Phil 4:6).
- **Reiterate Central Verse:** 1 Thessalonians 5:18 - This isn't just a
  suggestion; it's God's will.
- **Final Thought:** Gratitude is more than a feeling; it's a choice, a
  discipline reflecting trust in God's goodness, regardless of circumstances. It
  transforms our perspective and becomes a powerful witness.
- **Gentle Appeal:** Will you choose today to cultivate a grateful heart? Start
  with one practical step this week, asking God to help you see His blessings
  and express thanks intentionally.
