### Introduction (5 min)

- Welcome & Prayer
- Theme Introduction: The world's increasing darkness vs. God's call for His
  people to be light.
- Central Verse Read: Ephesians 5:8
- Brief Overview: We'll explore what it means _biblically_ to be light, based
  primarily on Ephesians 5, and our specific role today.
- [Write on board: Darkness vs. Light (Eph 5:8)]
- **(RQ)** What does 'light' practically mean in a Christian's life according to
  the Bible?

### Section 1: From Darkness to Light (8 min)

- **The Great Transformation:**
  - Core Truth: Conversion is a radical shift. (Eph 5:8a - "_were_ darkness...
    _are_ light")
  - Not just _in_ darkness, but _were_ darkness itself. Total change of nature
    through Christ.
  - [Whiteboard: WERE Darkness -> ARE Light (in the Lord)]
  - **(RQ)** How does understanding we _were_ darkness, not just _in_ it, change
    our view of salvation? (See 2 Cor 5:17)
- **The Source of Light:**
  - "in the Lord" (Eph 5:8b) - Light isn't inherent; it's derived solely from
    Christ.
  - Connection to John 8:12 (Jesus: "I am the light of the world").
  - [Analogy (from John 1:9): Like the moon reflecting the sun's light.]
- **The Command:**
  - "Walk as children of light" (Eph 5:8c) - An ongoing action, a lifestyle
    reflecting our new nature.
  - **(RQ)** If our nature is changed, why the command to 'walk'? (Reflects
    daily choices, dependence).

### Section 2: Living as Children of Light [*] (10 min)

- **The Fruit of Light:**
  - Ephesians 5:9 - "(for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness,
    righteousness, and truth)"
  - [Write on board: Fruit of Light (Eph 5:9) = Goodness + Righteousness +
    Truth]
  - _Goodness:_ Moral excellence, kindness in action (cf. Gal 5:22).
  - _Righteousness:_ Conformity to God's standard, justice (cf. Matt 5:6, 20).
  - _Truth:_ Honesty, integrity, alignment with God's reality (cf. John 14:6).
  - **(RQ)** How do these three elements challenge superficial 'niceness'?
- **The Goal of Light:**
  - Ephesians 5:10 - "finding out what is acceptable to the Lord."
  - Requires active seeking, discernment through God's Word.
  - Not based on feelings or cultural norms, but God's revealed will.
  - [Whiteboard: Goal (Eph 5:10) = Proving God's Will (Rom 12:2)]
  - **(RQ)** How do we practically 'find out' what pleases God daily? (Prayer,
    Bible Study).

### Section 3: Exposing Darkness, Upholding Truth (10 min)

- **Separation from Darkness:**
  - Ephesians 5:11 - "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of
    darkness, but rather expose them."
  - Clear command: No participation, no partnership in sin.
  - [Write on board: Eph 5:11 -> 1. No Fellowship 2. Expose/Reprove]
  - **(RQ)** What's the difference between judging persons and exposing sinful
    works? (Focus on actions vs. condemnation of soul).
- **The Power of Exposure:**
  - Ephesians 5:12-13 - Hidden sins vs. light making manifest.
  - Light reveals the true nature of things; truth exposes error.
  - Upholding God's clear moral standards (found in Scripture) _is_ exposing
    darkness.
  - [Concept: Light doesn't *create* the dirt in a room, it just reveals what
    was already there. Truth reveals sin.]
  - **(RQ)** Why is it often uncomfortable, yet necessary, to let biblical light
    shine on hidden or culturally accepted sins?
- [Aside: Our church standards, grounded in Scripture, aren't meant to be walls
  to keep people out, but guardrails based on God's loving law, designed to
  protect His people from the dangers of darkness revealed in His Word (Eph
  5:11-13).]

### Section 4: The Call to Awaken & The SDA Commission (7 min)

- **The Awakening Call:**
  - Ephesians 5:14 - "Awake, you who sleep, Arise from the dead, And Christ will
    give you light."
  - Gospel call to the spiritually dead/complacent.
  - Light brings life and awareness.
  - [Whiteboard: Awake (Recognize Need) -> Arise (Act) -> Christ Gives Light
    (Power)]
  - **(RQ)** Who in our sphere of influence needs this awakening call today?
- **Our Specific Commission:**
  - Connection to Matthew 5:14-16 - We _are_ the light; let it shine.
  - SDA Context: Called as watchmen (Ezek 3:17-19) and light-bearers for this
    specific time.
  - Reference EGW, T9 19: Set as watchmen, give the trumpet certain sound.
  - The 'light' we bear includes the final warning message: Three Angels'
    Messages (Rev 14:6-12).
  - [Write on board: SDA Role = Watchmen + Light Bearers (Matt 5:14) -> Proclaim
    Rev 14]
  - **(RQ)** How does our understanding of prophecy intensify our responsibility
    to shine the light of present truth?
- [Aside: Just as Paul urged the Ephesians to awaken, God calls His remnant
  people today not just to *possess* light, but to *actively share* the urgent,
  final messages designed to awaken a sleeping world before Christ's return.]

### Conclusion & Appeal (5 min)

- **Summary:** We were darkness, now light in Christ (Eph 5:8). This means
  living differently (Eph 5:9-10), separating from sin (Eph 5:11), and actively
  shining His truth (Eph 5:13-14; Matt 5:16).
- **The Urgency:** As the world darkens, our light _must_ shine brighter.
- **Personal Application:**
  - Walk daily in goodness, righteousness, truth (Eph 5:9).
  - Actively seek God's will (Eph 5:10).
  - Be willing to stand for truth, even when unpopular (Eph 5:11).
  - Share the awakening call of the Gospel and present truth (Eph 5:14; Rev 14).
- **Final Appeal:** Let us embrace our identity as children of light and fulfill
  our divine commission to illuminate the world with Christ's glory and His
  final message.
- Closing Prayer
