Consecrated, Lord, to Thee; Take my moments and my days, Let them flow in
ceaseless praise."

**Central Bible Verse:** Isaiah 58:6-7 - "Is not this the fast that I have
chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let
the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread
to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when
thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from
thine own flesh?"

### Introduction (5 min)

- Hook: Many practice forms of religion, including fasting. But what does God
  _truly_ value? **(RQ)**
- Context: Isaiah 58 addresses a people who felt God wasn't noticing their
  religious exercises.
- Introduce Central Question: What kind of fast, what kind of worship, truly
  pleases God according to His Word?
- [Write on board: Isaiah 58 - True vs. False Worship]

### Section 1: The Counterfeit Fast (10 min)

- **The Complaint (Isa 58:3a):** "Why have we fasted...and thou seest not?" -
  They performed the ritual but missed the point.
- **God's Diagnosis (Isa 58:3b-5):** Their fasting was self-serving.
  - Finding pleasure/pursuing self-interest (v. 3b).
    `[Whiteboard: Self-Serving Ritual]`
  - Exploiting workers/oppression (v. 3c). How can we claim to seek God while
    mistreating others? **(RQ)**
  - Strife and debate, striking with wickedness (v. 4a). Religion used as a
    cloak for contention.
  - External show: Bowing head, sackcloth, ashes (v. 5a).
    `[Whiteboard: External Show vs. Heart Change]`
  - God's Rejection: "Is _this_ the fast I have chosen?" (v. 5b). God sees
    beyond the outward performance.
- Connection: How might we engage in 'religious' activities today that lack
  genuine heart change or compassion? **(RQ)** (e.g., attending church but
  ignoring needs, praying publicly but harboring private sin).

### Section 2: The True Fast God Chooses (12 min) [*]

- **God's Definition (Isa 58:6-7):** Shifts from ritual denial to active
  righteousness.
  - **Justice & Liberation (v. 6):**
    - "Loose the bands of wickedness"
    - "Undo the heavy burdens"
    - "Let the oppressed go free"
    - "Break every yoke"
    - [Write on board: True Fast = Action (Isa 58:6)]
    - Focus: Actively working against injustice and oppression, both systemic
      and personal. How does our faith compel us to act for justice based on
      this verse? **(RQ)**
  - **Mercy & Compassion (v. 7):**
    - "Deal thy bread to the hungry"
    - "Bring the poor that are cast out to thy house"
    - "When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him"
    - "Hide not thyself from thine own flesh" (Recognize shared
      humanity/responsibility)
    - [Write on board: True Fast = Mercy (Isa 58:7)]
    - Focus: Practical, tangible acts of love and care for those in need.
    - `[Aside: That phrase "hide not thyself from thine own flesh" (Isa 58:7) is powerful. It cuts through any tendency to distance ourselves from others' needs. It reminds us we are all part of the same human family, interconnected, and responsible for one another, regardless of social status or circumstance.]`
- **Connecting Principle:** True worship isn't just about _not doing_ bad
  things; it's about _actively doing_ good, reflecting God's character (Micah
  6:8).
- **Character Transformation:** This isn't mere charity; it's the outflow of a
  heart changed by God – developing sympathy, self-denial, justice, love (James
  1:27).
- [Analogy (from Isa 58:6-7): Religion like a tree - outward leaves (rituals)
  mean little without fruit (acts of love/justice)].

### Section 3: Blessings of Obedience (12 min)

- **God's Promises for True Worship (Isa 58:8-9):** When our worship is genuine
  action...
  - **Spiritual Restoration & Healing (v. 8a):** "Then shall thy light break
    forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily."
    - [Whiteboard: Blessing 1: Light & Healing (Isa 58:8a)]
    - Connection: Living God's way brings spiritual vitality and restoration.
  - **God's Presence & Protection (v. 8b):** "Thy righteousness shall go before
    thee; the glory of the Lord shall be thy rereward."
    - [Whiteboard: Blessing 2: God's Presence (Isa 58:8b)]
    - God's character reflected in us becomes our vanguard; His glory protects
      us.
  - **Answered Prayer & Guidance (v. 9):** "Then shalt thou call, and the Lord
    shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am."
    - [Whiteboard: Blessing 3: Answered Prayer (Isa 58:9a)]
    - Intimacy with God grows through obedience rooted in love.
- **Condition:** These blessings follow the removal of oppression, malicious
  speech, and pointing the finger (v. 9b - linking back to the true fast).
- `[Aside: It's easy to focus on the 'don'ts' of religion. Isaiah 58 powerfully reminds us that God is intensely interested in the 'do's' – the active love and justice that flow from a heart connected to Him. This is the practical demonstration of the Gospel.]`
- **Link to Jesus:** Christ embodied this true fast perfectly (Acts 10:38). He
  calls us to follow His example (Matthew 25:34-40).

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

- **Summary:** Recap the stark contrast between self-serving ritual (Isa 58:3-5)
  and God-honoring action (Isa 58:6-7).
- **Core Message:** True fasting, true worship, is love in action. It's
  demonstrating the character of God through practical justice and mercy.
- **Challenge:** Are we practicing a religion of external forms, or one that
  actively engages in the work God calls "the fast I have chosen"? **(RQ)** How
  will we put this into practice?
- **Actionable Steps (Derived from Isa 58:6-7 & Matt 25):** Let's commit to one
  simple step this week:
  - **Meet a Need:** Identify one specific need around you reflecting Isaiah
    58:7 or Matthew 25 (hunger, clothing, loneliness) and take a practical step
    to help meet it. `[Write on board: Action 1: Meet a Need]`
  - **Act for Justice:** Following Isaiah 58:6, find one small way to stand
    against injustice – perhaps speaking up respectfully, supporting a relevant
    ministry, or praying specifically for the oppressed.
    `[Write on board: Action 2: Act for Justice]`
  - **Serve the "Least":** Intentionally seek out and serve someone often
    overlooked this week, remembering Jesus' words in Matthew 25:40: "Inasmuch
    as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done
    it unto me." `[Write on board: Action 3: Serve the "Least"]`
- **Invitation:** Let's ask God to help us move beyond mere ritual to embrace
  the active, compassionate worship He desires, reflecting His love to the
  world.
