### Introduction (5 min)

-   Hook: Familiar Christmas story, but holds profound lessons for our walk with God.
-   Who were the Magi? Learned men (scholars/astronomers) from the East, Gentiles.
-   Central Question: What can their persistent journey teach us about truly seeking God today? **(RQ)**
-   Overview: Follow their journey in Matthew 2, uncovering principles for our faith.
-   Read Central Verse: Matthew 2:2. `[Whiteboard: Matt 2:2 - Seeking the King]`

### Section 1: God Reveals His Truth (10 min)

-   **God Initiates Revelation:** He desires to be found.
    -   Scripture: Matthew 2:1-2; Psalm 19:1-4
    -   God used a star (nature/science) to reach these Gentiles. (Matt 2:2) `[Whiteboard: God Speaks -> Nature (Ps 19:1)]`
    -   Sometimes uses unconventional means when expected channels are unresponsive (State of Israel's leadership). (Matt 2:3-6). **(RQ)** Why might God work outside familiar structures?
    -   General Revelation (Nature - Ps 19:1-4) points to God's power & existence. `[Write on board: General Revelation (Nature)]`
    -   Magi likely knew prophecies too (Num 24:17 - Balaam's star; Daniel's influence in East). God meets seekers where they are.
-   **Revelation Demands a Response:** Seeing isn't enough.
    -   Scripture: Matthew 2:2
    -   The Magi *acted*: "We have seen... **and are come**..." `[Whiteboard: Revelation -> Response (Seeking - Matt 2:2)]`
    -   Observation must lead to action in the spiritual life.
    -   **(RQ)** How do we actively respond when God reveals truth to us through nature, His Word, or circumstances?

### Section 2: Seeking Requires Guidance & Persistence [*] (12 min)

-   **Specific Guidance Comes Through God's Word:** Nature points, the Word specifies.
    -   Scripture: Matthew 2:3-8
    -   The star led generally; the Scriptures (Micah 5:2 via priests) pinpointed Bethlehem. (Matt 2:4-6). `[Whiteboard: Nature (General) + Word (Specific - Micah 5:2) = Clearer Path]`
    -   Contrast: Magi (Gentiles) seeking diligently vs. Scribes/Priests (Custodians of Word) knowing facts but remaining indifferent. `[Write: Head Knowledge vs. Heart Seeking]`
    -   **(RQ)** Is simply knowing biblical facts the same as seeking God? What makes the difference? (James 1:22)
    -   `[Aside: Like spiritual embassies... Our church buildings represent our collective witness to biblical truth. They are like spiritual embassies—territory that should represent the kingdom of heaven, not the customs of the surrounding culture. Are we actively guiding seekers *from* this embassy *to* Christ? ]`
-   **Seeking Involves Overcoming Obstacles:** The path isn't always easy.
    -   Scripture: Matthew 2:3, 7-8
    -   Obstacles faced: Long/difficult journey, star disappearing (temporarily), Herod's hostility/deception, religious leaders' apathy.
    -   Their persistence is a model. They didn't turn back. `[Whiteboard: Obstacles -> Persistence (Heb 12:1-2)]`
    -   **(RQ)** What obstacles (external pressures, internal doubts, spiritual laziness) hinder our seeking of Christ today? How can the Magi's example encourage us to persevere?

### Section 3: The Joy and Goal of Seeking (12 min)

-   **The Journey Toward God is Marked by Joy:** Finding Him brings delight.
    -   Scripture: Matthew 2:9-10
    -   When the star reappeared and led them to the house, "they rejoiced with exceeding great joy." (Matt 2:10). `[Whiteboard: Seeking -> Finding -> JOY! (Matt 2:10)]`
    -   This wasn't mere relief, but profound gladness in nearing Christ.
    -   **(RQ)** Does our pursuit and finding of God's presence in His Word and prayer fill us with deep joy? (cf. Psalm 16:11)
-   **True Seeking Culminates in Worship:** The ultimate destination.
    -   Scripture: Matthew 2:11
    -   They didn't just verify the star's message; they "fell down, and worshipped him." `[Whiteboard: Goal = WORSHIP (Matt 2:11)]`
    -   Worship involves:
        -   Humility & Reverence ("fell down")
        -   Adoration ("worshipped")
        -   Giving sacrificially ("opened their treasures," presented gifts - gold, frankincense, myrrh). Symbolic of giving our best, our allegiance, our all to the King.
    -   Their aim wasn't just knowledge, but devotion.
-   **The Church as a Guiding Star:** Our role in pointing others.
    -   Like the star, our lives and the church community should faithfully point others directly to Jesus. `[Analogy (from Matt 5:16): Church/Believer as lighthouse, consistently shining Christ's light to guide lost ships to safety in Him.]`
    -   **(RQ)** How can we, individually and as a church, be clearer, more faithful 'stars' guiding people to Jesus? (Matt 5:14-16)
    -   `[Aside: Using worldly means for God's kingdom... The Magi used their skills (astronomy) and resources (gifts) acquired in their context to honor Christ. We too can dedicate our talents, education, and resources, regardless of their origin, fully to God's service and glory.]`

### Conclusion and Appeal (6 min)

-   **Summary:** God reveals Himself (nature, Word); He invites a response of active seeking; this seeking requires persistence through difficulties and finds its joyful culmination in genuine worship.
-   **The Choice:** Be like the Magi – seek diligently, follow the light (especially God's Word), overcome obstacles, and offer heartfelt worship.
    -   Avoid the indifference of the scribes (knowledge without action).
    -   Avoid the hostility of Herod (threatened by Christ's kingship).
-   **Personal Application:**
    -   Where is God revealing Himself to you right now? (Nature, Word, Conscience)
    -   How are you responding? Are you actively seeking Him?
    -   What specific step will you take this week to seek Christ more intentionally and worship Him more fully? Consider these examples derived from the Magi's journey:
        -   **Action Step 1:** Dedicate 10 extra minutes each morning this week to reading Matthew's gospel, asking God to guide you like the star guided the Magi. (Focus: Seeking via Word)
        -   **Action Step 2:** Identify one 'obstacle' (like distraction, busyness, or doubt) hindering your worship time or Bible study and make a specific plan to overcome it this week. (Focus: Persistence)
        -   **Action Step 3:** Choose one specific way to 'offer a gift' to Christ this week – perhaps through dedicated service to someone in need, a special thank offering, or intentionally sharing your faith story. (Focus: Worship/Giving)
-   **Final Thought:** The Magi sought the newborn King. We have the fullness of His revelation in Jesus Christ and His Word. Let us follow His light with even greater diligence and joy.
-   **Call to Prayer:** Commit to being active seekers and true worshippers of King Jesus.
