# Bible Study: Sin and the Sanctuary—From Eden to the Throne

## 1) Foundations: What Is Sin and Why Does It Matter?

- Sin is lawlessness—transgression of God’s moral law (the Ten Commandments).
  - 1 John 3:4; Romans 7:7; James 2:10-12
- All have sinned (Romans 3:23); sin separates us from God (Isaiah 59:2).
- The penalty of sin is death (Romans 6:23) because the wages of cutting ourselves off from the Life-Giver is death.

[DYK🔎] The New Testament word hamartia often means “missing the mark,” but the apostles define that “mark” precisely: the law of God (1 John 3:4; Romans 7:7). Sin isn’t merely mistakes—it is moral rebellion measured by God’s holy standard.

[Q] “If God is love, why is the penalty death?”
- Because God is holy and just (Isaiah 6:3; Psalm 89:14). Love does not ignore justice, and justice does not negate mercy. In the gospel, God maintains justice while He saves sinners through a Substitute (Romans 3:25-26).

## 2) The Gospel Path Opened: God’s Provision

- From Eden, God promised a Deliverer (Genesis 3:15) and covered the fallen pair with garments of skin—implying a life given to cover their shame (Genesis 3:21).
- God explained the principle: “the life of the flesh is in the blood… it is the blood that makes atonement” (Leviticus 17:11; Hebrews 9:22).
- John the Baptist identified Jesus as “the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29). Jesus is both Sacrifice and Priest.

[Q] “Why blood?”
- Life is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11). Blood symbolizes life offered in place of the sinner’s life—substitutionary atonement pointing to Christ (Isaiah 53:4-6; 1 Peter 2:24).

## 3) “Your Way, O God, Is in the Sanctuary” (Psalm 77:13)

- God said, “Let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8). The sanctuary was the gospel in symbols, teaching how God removes sin while restoring His presence among His people.

### The Structure (Incremental View)

- Courtyard: altar of burnt offering, bronze laver (Exodus 27–30).
- Holy Place: lampstand (light), table of showbread (bread), altar of incense (intercession) (Exodus 25–30).
- Most Holy Place: the ark with the Ten Commandments, the mercy seat, and God’s presence between the cherubim (Exodus 25:10-22; Hebrews 9:3-5).

What they represented:
- Altar of burnt offering: the cross—Christ’s sacrifice (Hebrews 9:26; Ephesians 5:2).
- Laver: cleansing and new birth—baptism/washing (Titus 3:5; Ephesians 5:26).
- Lampstand: Christ the Light and the Spirit’s witness through the church (John 8:12; Revelation 1:12-13, 20).
- Showbread: Christ the Bread of Life—God’s Word that sustains (John 6:35; Matthew 4:4).
- Altar of incense: Christ’s continual intercession mingling with our prayers (Hebrews 7:25; Revelation 8:3-4).
- Ark of the Covenant: God’s throne founded on law and mercy (Psalm 89:14); the law preserved in the heart of the covenant (Exodus 25:16; Hebrews 10:16).
- Mercy seat: God’s merciful government—where atoning blood is applied (Leviticus 16:14-15; Hebrews 4:16).

[DYK🔎] The Hebrew word for “atonement” (kaphar) means “to cover” or “to wipe/purge.” The sanctuary taught both covering guilt (forgiveness) and cleansing defilement (transformation and final removal: Leviticus 16:16, 30).

## 4) Priests, Offerings, and What They Taught

### The Priests’ Duty and Representation
- Duties:
  - Teach holy vs. common; clean vs. unclean (Leviticus 10:10-11).
  - Offer sacrifices; maintain lamps; burn incense; present bread; bless the people (Leviticus 24:5-9; Exodus 27:20-21; Numbers 6:22-27).
  - Bear responsibility for the sanctuary service (Numbers 18:1).
- Representation:
  - Priests prefigured Christ our High Priest (Hebrews 5:1-5; 8:1-2).
  - The high priest bore the names of the tribes on his heart and shoulders (Exodus 28:9-12, 29-30)—a picture of Christ carrying and loving His people.

[Q] “If all believers are a ‘royal priesthood’ (1 Peter 2:9), why do we need Christ as Priest?”
- In Israel there were many priests but only one high priest at any given time (Leviticus 21:10; Hebrews 9:7). God initially claimed every firstborn male for priestly service (Exodus 13:2), but after the apostasy at Sinai He took the Levites in the place of the firstborn to serve (Numbers 3:12-13; 8:16-19). This pattern shows that while many may serve as priests, only one anointed high priest mediates the nation’s atonement. In the new covenant, believers are a holy, royal priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices and interceding for others (1 Peter 2:5, 9; Romans 12:1), yet there is still only one High Priest—Jesus—who alone mediates atonement and access to God (1 Timothy 2:5; Hebrews 7:24-25; 8:1-2). Our priesthood is derivative and missional; His is unique, perfect, and saving.

### The Offerings and Their Meaning (Leviticus 1–7)
- Burnt offering (Lev 1): total consecration—life wholly yielded to God; fulfilled in Christ’s perfect surrender (Hebrews 10:7-10).
- Grain/meal offering (Lev 2): gratitude and dependence on God’s provision; symbol of Christ’s sinless life offered (John 6:51).
- Peace/fellowship offering (Lev 3): communion and thanksgiving; Christ is our peace (Ephesians 2:14).
- Sin (purification) offering (Lev 4): cleansing for unintentional sin; blood applied to the sanctuary shows sin transferred to God’s plan for removal.
- Trespass (guilt/restitution) offering (Lev 5–6): addresses specific wrongs; requires restitution—true repentance makes wrongs right (Luke 19:8-9).

[DYK🔎] In sin offerings the sinner laid hands on the animal, confessing sins (Leviticus 4:4; 16:21). This symbolized transfer of guilt to the substitute—pointing to Christ “made to be sin for us” (2 Corinthians 5:21).

## 5) Daily and Yearly Services: Forgiveness and Cleansing

- Daily (tamid) service: continual offerings and priestly ministry secured ongoing forgiveness and maintained access to God (Exodus 29:38-42; Hebrews 10:11).
  - Sins were symbolically transferred to the sanctuary through the blood or priestly ministry (Leviticus 4:6-7, 17-18).
- Yearly Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur): a solemn cleansing of the sanctuary and people (Leviticus 16; 23:26-32).
  - High priest entered the Most Holy Place with sacrificial blood to cleanse and “make atonement… because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 16:16, 30).
  - After cleansing, the live goat (for Azazel) bore confessed sins into the wilderness—final removal of sin’s record and responsibility.

[Q] “Where did the sins ‘go’?”
- First to the substitute, then into the sanctuary’s record through the blood (Leviticus 4:6-7), then, on the Day of Atonement, away from the camp, showing ultimate separation of sin from God’s people (Leviticus 16:20-22).

[Q] “Is the scapegoat a second savior?”
- No. Only the slain goat’s blood atones (Leviticus 16:16). The live goat bears away the already-atoned sins, representing the final disposal of sin and the responsibility of the originator of sin (cf. Revelation 20:10). Christ saves; the adversary bears his just end.

## 6) The Sanctuary and Jesus: Not “Jewish Only,” but Christ-Centered and Ongoing

- The earthly sanctuary was “a copy and shadow of the heavenly things” (Hebrews 8:5; 9:23-24). Moses built it after the pattern shown on the mountain (Exodus 25:9, 40).
- Jesus fulfills the entire system:
  - Sacrifice: “once for all” at the cross (Hebrews 9:26; 10:10-12; John 19:30).
  - Priesthood: Christ is our High Priest “in the true tabernacle” (Hebrews 8:1-2), mediating the benefits of His sacrifice (Hebrews 7:25).
  - Access: The veil was torn (Matthew 27:51), signifying open access through Christ’s blood (Hebrews 10:19-22).
- Therefore, the sanctuary is not a mere “Jewish thing.” It is God’s own teaching model of the gospel, continued and fulfilled in Christ’s heavenly ministry (Hebrews 9:11-12, 24).

[DYK🔎] Hebrews 9:23 says the “heavenly things” needed purification—not because heaven is dirty, but because the plan of salvation must legally and morally resolve the sin problem before the universe (cf. Job 1–2; Ephesians 3:10), vindicating God’s government through Christ’s blood.

## 7) Present Truth: What Is Jesus Doing Now?

- Scripture points to a phase of Christ’s ministry described as the cleansing of the sanctuary (Daniel 8:14), harmonizing with the “hour of His judgment” in the first angel’s message (Revelation 14:6-7).
- Historicist understanding (day-year principle: Numbers 14:34; Ezekiel 4:6) links Daniel 8:14 with Daniel 9:24-27 (the 70 weeks) beginning in 457 BC (decree to restore Jerusalem; Ezra 7). This timeline brings us to the close of the 2300 years in the 19th century—what Adventist pioneers identified as the beginning of the antitypical Day of Atonement: Christ’s final, pre-Advent work of judgment and cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary (Hebrews 9:23-28).
- In this phase, Jesus:
  - Intercedes as our Advocate (1 John 2:1; Hebrews 7:25).
  - Brings His people into heart obedience under the new covenant (Hebrews 8:10; 10:16-17).
  - Prepares a people who “keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Revelation 14:12).

[Q] “If Jesus finished at the cross, what remains?”
- The sacrifice is complete (“It is finished,” John 19:30). Yet Hebrews insists on an ongoing priestly application of that finished sacrifice (Hebrews 8:1-2; 9:24-28). Forgiveness and judgment are two sides of one gospel work—God both pardons and sets the record straight, cleansing a people for His presence (Titus 2:14).

## 8) The Sanctuary’s Central Message

- God is holy and desires to dwell with His people (Exodus 25:8).
- Sin is deadly and detestable; it costs life and disrupts communion (Leviticus 10:10; Psalm 97:10).
- Grace provides a Substitute and a Mediator—Jesus, the Lamb and High Priest (John 1:29; Hebrews 8:1-2).
- True repentance includes confession and restitution (Leviticus 5:5-6; 6:1-7; 1 John 1:9).
- God’s law remains central to His covenant; mercy and truth meet at the mercy seat (Psalm 85:10; Hebrews 8:10).
- Final atonement includes both forgiveness and cleansing—sin must be removed from the life and from God’s universe (Leviticus 16:30; Revelation 21:27).

## 9) Practical Responses: Living in the Day of Atonement

This truth calls us to:
1. Understanding
   - See sin as God sees it; measure by His law, not culture (Romans 7:12; James 1:25).
   - Look steadfastly to Jesus, our only righteousness (Philippians 3:9; 1 Corinthians 1:30).
2. Response
   - Confess and forsake sin; make things right where possible (1 John 1:9; Proverbs 28:13; Luke 19:8-9).
   - Draw near with a true heart in full assurance, cleansed by Christ (Hebrews 10:19-22).
   - “Afflict our souls” (humble repentance) and cooperate with our High Priest (Leviticus 23:27; Micah 6:8).
3. Growth
   - Walk in the light of the Holy Place: Word (showbread), prayer/intercession (incense), witness empowered by the Spirit (lampstand).
   - Keep the commandments through Christ’s indwelling Spirit (John 14:15-17; Revelation 14:12).
   - Share the everlasting gospel—“The hour of His judgment has come” (Revelation 14:6-7).

[Q] “Is focusing on the sanctuary fear-based?”
- Properly understood, it is assurance-based: we have a perfect High Priest who “always lives to make intercession” (Hebrews 7:25). Judgment begins at the house of God (1 Peter 4:17) so that God’s people may be vindicated and prepared—“There is forgiveness with You, that You may be feared” (Psalm 130:4).

## 10) Summary of the Sanctuary (Materials/Furniture) and Symbolism

- Materials: acacia wood (durable humanity), overlaid with gold (divine glory), silver sockets, bronze (judgment), blue/purple/scarlet linens (heavenly royalty and atoning blood) (Exodus 25–27).
- Courtyard:
  - Bronze altar: substitutionary death of Christ.
  - Laver: cleansing for service—baptism and daily renewal.
- Holy Place:
  - Table of showbread: Christ the Word sustains the church.
  - Lampstand: Spirit-filled witness; Christ the Light.
  - Altar of incense: Christ’s intercession; our prayers accepted in Him.
- Most Holy Place:
  - Ark with the law: God’s character and government.
  - Mercy seat with cherubim: throne of grace where blood is applied.

[DYK🔎] The camp and sanctuary were arranged with Israel surrounding God’s dwelling (Numbers 2). God literally “pitched His tent” among them—a preview of the Word who “tabernacled” among us (John 1:14).

## Conclusion

Jesus is both the Sacrifice who died and the High Priest who lives. The sanctuary reveals the seriousness of sin, the beauty of holiness, and the sure pathway by which God forgives, cleanses, and restores His people to His presence. Today, Christ ministers in the true tabernacle, preparing a people who reflect His character and are ready to meet Him.

### Key Takeaways:
1. Truth: Sin is lawlessness; its penalty is death. God’s plan—revealed in the sanctuary—centers on Christ’s sacrifice and priesthood.
2. Application: Confess, forsake, and make restitution. Walk daily in Word, prayer, and Spirit-empowered witness while trusting Jesus’ intercession.
3. Growth: Embrace the present truth of Christ’s heavenly ministry. Cooperate with Him as He cleanses a people for His soon return.

“Therefore, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus… let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith” (Hebrews 10:19-22).
