# Bible Study: One Voice, Many Languages—The Gift of Tongues and the Reversal of Babel

Thesis: In Scripture, the gift of tongues is the Spirit-given ability to speak intelligible human languages for the spread of the gospel, reversing the curse of confusion from Babel. It is not given to all believers, and in worship it must be understood—either naturally or by interpretation—so that the church is edified.

## 1) Biblical Foundation

- Genesis 11:1-9 — The division of human language at Babel as judgment and scattering.
- Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:1-11 — Pentecost as the outpouring of the Spirit for mission; each heard “in his own language.”
- 1 Corinthians 12–14 — Tongues as one gift among many; primacy of edification, order, and understanding.
- Acts 10:44-48; 19:1-7 — Tongues as confirming sign when new groups receive the gospel.
- Zephaniah 3:9; Revelation 14:6; 7:9 — God’s end-time purpose: one pure message in every language; unity in diverse tongues around the Lamb.

[DYK🔎] The Greek word glossa means both “tongue” and “language.” In Acts 2:6, 8 Luke adds dialektos—“dialect.” The Spirit enabled real, recognized languages for hearers from across the Roman world.

## 2) From Curse to Calling: Babel and Pentecost

- Background: After the Flood, people sought unity without God (Genesis 11:1-4). God “confused” (Hebrew balal) their speech (Genesis 11:7), dispersing the nations (Genesis 11:8-9).
- Significance: The confusion of language is not a moral evil in language itself, but a judgment that fractures understanding and cooperation apart from God.
- Redemption trajectory: God promises a future where He will “restore to the peoples a pure language, that they all may call on the name of the LORD, to serve Him with one accord” (Zephaniah 3:9, NKJV).

Pentecost fulfills this trajectory:
- Acts 2:4-11 — The Spirit empowers the disciples to speak; the crowd hears the “mighty works of God” in their own languages (Parthians to Arabs).
- Joel 2 is explicitly cited: the Spirit is poured out for witness to “all flesh.”
- Function: Mission, not spectacle. The miracle removes a barrier so the gospel can be understood immediately.

[DYK🔎] Many pilgrims at Pentecost were bilingual diaspora Jews. Luke still stresses a miracle of comprehension: “each one was hearing them speak in his own dialect” (Acts 2:6), highlighting the Spirit’s intent—clarity.

Ellen G. White notes that at Pentecost “the languages spoken were not unknown gibberish, but languages of the nations” (paraphrase, Acts of the Apostles, ch. 4), underlining that the Spirit’s work advances understanding and mission.

## 3) The Corinthian Corrective: Intelligibility, Edification, and Order

1 Corinthians 12–14 sets the pastoral boundaries:
- Not all gifts to all: “Are all apostles? … Do all speak with tongues?” (1 Corinthians 12:29-30). Answer: No. Gifts are distributed “as He wills” (1 Corinthians 12:11).
- Love is greater: Even “tongues of men and of angels” without love are nothing (1 Corinthians 13:1). The measure of spirituality is love, not a particular gift.
- Edification governs use:
  - “Unless you utter by the tongue words easy to understand, how will it be known what is spoken?” (1 Corinthians 14:9).
  - “In the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding… than ten thousand words in a tongue” (1 Corinthians 14:19).
  - If a tongue is spoken publicly, “let there be an interpreter… if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in church” (1 Corinthians 14:27-28).
- Sign to unbelievers in a specific sense: Paul cites Isaiah 28:11-12 (1 Corinthians 14:21) to show that foreign speech can function as a judgment-sign to the resistant. Uninterpreted tongues in worship make outsiders think “you are mad” (1 Corinthians 14:23). By contrast, intelligible prophecy convicts and builds up (1 Corinthians 14:24-25).
- Order reveals God’s character: “God is not the author of confusion but of peace… Let all things be done decently and in order” (1 Corinthians 14:33, 40).

Conclusion: The true gift of tongues in the church must lead to understanding and edification. Unintelligible speech in public worship, without interpretation, is out of order.

## 4) Tongues as Mission-Sign Across Boundaries

- Acts 10:44-48 — The Spirit falls on Gentiles in Cornelius’s house; tongues signal to Jewish believers that God has granted repentance to Gentiles. This is about inclusion and comprehension of God’s works, not a private ecstasy.
- Acts 19:1-7 — Disciples at Ephesus receive the Spirit; tongues and prophecy mark their incorporation into Christ’s mission.
- Other fillings without tongues:
  - Acts 4:31 — The place was shaken; they were filled with the Spirit and spoke the word with boldness—no tongues recorded.
  - Acts 8:14-17; 9:17-20 — The Spirit is given; transformed witness follows, tongues not always mentioned.

[Q] “Isn’t tongues the initial evidence of the Spirit?”  
Scripture says the Spirit distributes gifts as He wills (1 Corinthians 12:11), and asks rhetorically, “Do all speak with tongues?” (1 Corinthians 12:30). The recurring evidence of the Spirit is bold witness, holy love, obedience, and unity (Acts 4:31; Galatians 5:22-23; John 14:15-17), not a single uniform manifestation.

## 5) Understanding the Nature of Biblical Tongues

- Real languages: At Pentecost, known languages were recognized by hearers (Acts 2:8-11). This best fits the biblical pattern of tongues—xenolalia for mission.
- Aim: Understanding. Tongues without interpretation do not edify (1 Corinthians 14:6-12).
- Governance:
  - Two or three at most, in turn, with interpretation (1 Corinthians 14:27).
  - If no interpreter, keep silent in church (1 Corinthians 14:28).
  - Edification of the body is the test (1 Corinthians 14:26).

[DYK🔎] Paul’s “tongues of angels” (1 Corinthians 13:1) occurs in a passage filled with rhetorical hyperbole (moving mountains, giving away all possessions, delivering body to be burned). When angels speak in Scripture, they use human language that is understood (Daniel 10:11; Luke 1:13, 28-30).

## 6) Reversing the Curse: Present Truth for Mission and Worship

- Great Commission requires language crossing: “Make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28:19). The Spirit equips the church to cross linguistic lines.
- End-time picture: The everlasting gospel goes to “every nation, tribe, tongue, and people” (Revelation 14:6), and a redeemed multitude from “all tongues” worships the Lamb (Revelation 7:9-10). God does not erase diversity; He unites it in truth.
- Worship today:
  - Prioritize clarity: Preach, pray, and sing so people understand (1 Corinthians 14:9, 19).
  - Use interpretation where needed; value translators and interpreters as Spirit-enabled servants.
  - Test manifestations by Scripture and fruit (Isaiah 8:20; Matthew 7:20; 1 John 4:1).
  - Guard order and peace in assembly (1 Corinthians 14:33, 40).

Practical applications:
- Pray for the Spirit to make your witness clear across cultures and languages.
- Support Bible translation and missionary training; learn languages for mission if called.
- In multilingual settings, use interpretation, subtitles, or multiple-language services so that “all may learn and all may be encouraged” (1 Corinthians 14:31).
- Measure spirituality by love and obedience, not by spectacular displays (1 Corinthians 13; John 14:23-26).

## 7) Common Questions

[Q] “Aren’t languages themselves a curse?”  
The curse at Babel was the confusion and scattering that frustrated human pride (Genesis 11:7-9). Languages are part of God’s providence and can be beautiful instruments of praise. In redemption, God doesn’t abolish languages; He purifies speech and unites hearts in truth (Zephaniah 3:9; Revelation 7:9-10).

[Q] “What about private prayer in tongues?”  
Paul distinguishes between private edification and public edification. He allows for personal prayer, but in the assembly he insists on intelligibility and interpretation (1 Corinthians 14:14-19, 27-28). Private practices must not become a test of fellowship or spirituality (1 Corinthians 12:29-30).

[Q] “Didn’t Jesus promise tongues for all believers in Mark 16:17?”  
Even if one includes the longer ending of Mark, the signs accompany believers as God wills for mission, not as universal requirements. The broader New Testament shows diverse distributions of gifts (1 Corinthians 12:11), and tongues do not appear in every Spirit-filling.

[Q] “Are ecstatic utterances ever a true biblical gift?”  
Scripture’s emphasis is on intelligibility and edification. Uninterpreted speech fails that test. Moreover, non-Christian religions also exhibit ecstatic speech. The Bible’s safeguard is testing by the Word, the fruit of the Spirit, and the edification of the church (Isaiah 8:20; Galatians 5:22-23; 1 Corinthians 14:26-33).

## Conclusion

Key Takeaways:
1. Truth: The gift of tongues in Scripture is Spirit-empowered speech in real, understandable languages for the advance of the gospel, particularly across cultural boundaries (Acts 2; 10; 19).
2. Application: In worship, intelligibility and order are non-negotiable. Seek love, truth, and edification above spectacle (1 Corinthians 13–14). Support translation, interpretation, and mission to every tongue (Revelation 14:6).
3. Growth: Pray for the Spirit to reverse Babel’s confusion in your life—purifying your speech, reconciling relationships, and enabling clear witness. Let love govern every gift.

Final encouragement: “For then I will restore to the peoples a pure language, that they all may call on the name of the LORD, to serve Him with one accord” (Zephaniah 3:9, NKJV). May the Spirit make our words clear, our hearts one, and our witness powerful until every tongue confesses that Jesus Christ is Lord.
