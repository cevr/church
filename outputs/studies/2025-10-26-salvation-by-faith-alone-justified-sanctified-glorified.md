# Bible Study: Salvation by Faith Alone—Justified, Sanctified, Glorified

## Biblical Foundation: One Gospel in Three Movements

Thesis: In the gospel, God does three inseparable works for the believer by faith:
- Justification: God pardons and accepts the sinner in Christ—and at conversion imparts power to walk in newness of life.
- Sanctification: By the same faith, the believer grows in obedience and purity, living out Christ’s life within.
- Glorification: At Christ’s return, the work is consummated with immortality and sinless nature.

Key texts:
- Justification: Romans 5:1; Luke 7:48–50; Mark 2:5–12; 1 John 1:9; Zechariah 3:1–5
- Sanctification: John 17:17; 1 Thessalonians 4:3; Romans 6:1–14; Titus 2:11–14; Galatians 5:16–25
- Glorification: Romans 8:30; 1 Corinthians 15:51–54; 1 John 3:2; Philippians 3:20–21

[DYK🔎] The New Testament speaks of salvation in three tenses: we have been saved (Ephesians 2:8), we are being saved (1 Corinthians 1:18), and we will be saved (Romans 5:9–10). These correspond to justification, sanctification, and glorification.

[DYK🔎] The Greek for “justify” (dikaioō) means to declare righteous, while “sanctify” (hagiazō) means to make holy or set apart. In Scripture, God’s declaration never stands alone—He unites the believer to Christ (Romans 6:5), imparting the life that matches the verdict (Romans 8:1–4).

[Q] “Isn’t salvation by faith alone threatened if we include sanctification?”  
Faith alone saves because it unites us to Christ alone. But the faith that unites to Christ never remains alone; it “works by love” (Galatians 5:6) and “fulfills the righteous requirement of the law” as we walk “according to the Spirit” (Romans 8:4). We are not justified by sanctification, but the justified are invariably sanctified.

## Justification’s Double Gift: Pardon and Power

1. Forgiveness granted:
   - “Being justified by faith, we have peace with God” (Romans 5:1).
   - “Your sins are forgiven” (Mark 2:5; Luke 7:48–50).

2. Power commissioned—immediately:
   - To the woman: “Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more” (John 8:11).
   - To the paralytic: “Arise, take up thy bed, and walk” (Mark 2:9–12). Jesus heals to show He has “authority on earth to forgive sins.” The command carries the power.
   - To the man at Bethesda: “Sin no more” (John 5:14).
   - Romans 6:6–14: United with Christ in His death and life, we are to “reckon” ourselves dead to sin and alive unto God; “sin shall not have dominion over you.”

[DYK🔎] The command “Arise” (egeire) in Mark 2:9 is the same verb used for resurrection. Justification carries resurrection power (Ephesians 2:5–6). What Christ commands, He enables.

[Q] “Isn’t justification only legal?”  
It is a forensic declaration based on Christ’s merits alone (Romans 3:24–26). Yet Scripture consistently shows that when God declares, His word creates what it declares (Genesis 1; Isaiah 55:11). In justification, the believer is also born again (John 3:3–8), receiving the Spirit (Galatians 3:2) and thus power to walk. The merit is Christ’s; the might is the Spirit’s; the means is faith.

## Sanctification: Salvation by Faith Alone—Through a Life of Obedience by Faith

- Definition: Sanctification is God’s work of making us holy in life, conforming us to Christ’s character (John 17:17; 2 Corinthians 3:18).
- Agent: The Holy Spirit writes God’s law on the heart (Jeremiah 31:33; Ezekiel 36:26–27; Romans 8:2–4).
- Method: Abiding in Christ (John 15:1–10), walking in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16), and obeying by faith (James 2:17–26; Romans 1:5).

Results:
- Real victory over known sin: “Sin shall not have dominion over you” (Romans 6:14); grace teaches us to “deny ungodliness” (Titus 2:11–12).
- Ongoing growth: “The path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more” (Proverbs 4:18).

Complete sanctification—possible and necessary (relative to time and light):
- God calls us to present-tense completeness in His revealed will: “perfect and complete in all the will of God” (Colossians 4:12); “entirely sanctified” (1 Thessalonians 5:23–24).
- Scripture balances completeness with growth: “First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn” (Mark 4:28); “by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified” (Hebrews 10:14).
- This means: At every stage, full surrender and obedience to known light is complete sanctification for that time; as more light comes, growth advances.

Ellen G. White insight: “The righteousness by which we are justified is imputed; the righteousness by which we are sanctified is imparted.” And, “At every stage of development our life may be perfect; yet if God’s purpose for us is fulfilled, there will be continual advancement.”

[Q] “Are you teaching sinless perfection now?”  
We are teaching present victory over known sin by abiding in Christ (1 John 3:6; Romans 6:12–14). This is not the eradication of the sinful nature before glorification (Romans 7:24; 8:23). We may still be tempted and capable of falling, yet in Christ we need not yield (1 Corinthians 10:13; Jude 24). Growth continues as light increases.

## Glorification: The Consummation

- Promise: Those whom God justified, He will also glorify (Romans 8:30).
- Event: At Christ’s return, mortality puts on immortality (1 Corinthians 15:51–54). We “shall be like Him” (1 John 3:2), with bodies transformed (Philippians 3:20–21) and the presence of sin forever removed (Revelation 21:4, 27).

[DYK🔎] The sanctuary pattern mirrors the gospel: at the altar (sacrifice) we see justification, at the laver (washing) sanctification, and in the Most Holy Place (glory) the consummation of God’s presence—glorification.

## Case Studies: Jesus’ Pardon Creates Power

- Woman caught in adultery (John 8:1–11): First, no condemnation; then, “sin no more.” The verdict precedes and empowers the walk.
- Paralytic (Mark 2:1–12): First, “Thy sins be forgiven thee”; then, “Arise.” The visible healing proves the invisible pardon and illustrates the power given to obey.
- Paul’s commission (Acts 26:18): The gospel turns people “from darkness to light… that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance,” linking pardon with practical deliverance “from the power of Satan unto God.”

## Practical Application: How to Walk in Pardon and Power

This truth calls us to:
1. Understanding
   - Believe the verdict: “No condemnation… in Christ Jesus” (Romans 8:1).
   - Count on the power: “Reckon yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin” (Romans 6:11).

2. Response
   - Daily surrender: Present yourself to God (Romans 6:13; 12:1).
   - Abide in the Word and prayer: John 15:7; Luke 11:13 (ask for the Spirit).
   - Act in faith: Obey as God speaks; His command carries enabling (Philippians 2:12–13).
   - Use God’s means: Scripture, prayer, fellowship, the Sabbath, and the Lord’s Supper build faith that works by love (Acts 2:42; Hebrews 10:24–25).

3. Growth
   - Confess and rise if you fall: “We have an Advocate” (1 John 2:1); confess and believe cleansing (1 John 1:9).
   - Add virtue to faith (2 Peter 1:5–10) and press on (Philippians 3:12–14).
   - Keep the blessed hope before you (Titus 2:13–14).

[Q] “What if I don’t feel the power to overcome?”  
Feelings don’t govern faith. Take God at His word. Ask for the Holy Spirit (Luke 11:13), claim specific promises (2 Peter 1:4), and step forward. As you act, God supplies strength (Hebrews 4:16; Romans 8:13).

[Q] “If we’re saved by faith alone, do works matter?”  
We are not saved by works (Ephesians 2:8–9), but we are saved “unto good works” (Ephesians 2:10). Works demonstrate living faith (James 2:17–26) and glorify God (Matthew 5:16). They are the fruit, not the root.

## Conclusion

- Salvation is by faith alone in Christ alone. The same faith that justifies also sanctifies; justification gives both pardon and immediate enabling to walk in newness of life.
- Complete sanctification is possible and necessary as full, present surrender to all known light—with continual advancement as God reveals more.
- Glorification will finish what grace has begun, but today we may live in victory over known sin by abiding in Jesus.

Key Takeaways:
1. Truth: God’s justifying word both forgives and empowers (John 8:11; Romans 6:11–14).
2. Application: Live by abiding faith—surrender, trust, obey, and grow (John 15:5; Philippians 2:13).
3. Growth: Aim for present completeness in known duty and continual advancement as light increases (Colossians 4:12; Proverbs 4:18).

_Final scripture for courage_: “Now unto Him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy… be glory and majesty” (Jude 24–25).
