# 2025 Q3 W7 - August 9-15
## The Bread and Water of Life

**Overarching Theme:** The Wilderness School of Faith: Learning Total Dependence on Christ
**Central Focus:** Understanding that life's trials are God's ordained classroom to unlearn self-reliance and unbelief, and to learn moment-by-moment dependence on Christ, thereby perfecting a character fit for heaven.
**Key Texts:** Exodus 16:4, Exodus 17:7, 1 Corinthians 10:4, John 6:35

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: We often look back at Israel in the wilderness and marvel at their failure. But what if we reframed it? What if the wilderness was not a punishment, but a **school**? A divine university, with a curriculum designed by God Himself for the express purpose of character transformation.
-   Theme Introduction: Today, we will enter this "Wilderness School of Faith." We will see from Scripture that God's primary goal was to teach His newly freed people how to live by **trust**, not by sight or by feeling. This is perhaps the most critical lesson for God's people living at the very end of time.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Wilderness School of Faith"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Our lives, brothers and sisters, are a wilderness journey. Our personal trials—financial, relational, health—are God's curriculum for us. The final exam is not just getting through the trial, but developing a character of unwavering faith, a character fit for the Heavenly Canaan.
-   Roadmap: First, we will examine the core subject of this school: the problem of the unbelieving heart. Then, we will study God's divine textbook: His provision, which always tested their faith and pointed them to the true Messiah.

### II. The Curriculum of Crisis: The Unbelieving Heart Exposed (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Let's open the scriptures to see how trials are designed to reveal what is truly in the heart. The first lesson in God's school is always a diagnosis of the problem.

#### A. The Test of Bitter Waters and Fading Memory (Est. 8-9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 15:22-24
        -   Reading/Context: "So Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea... for three days in the wilderness and found no water. Now when they came to Marah, they could not drink the waters... for they were bitter... And the people **complained** against Moses, saying, 'What shall we drink?'" Just three days prior, they were singing praises for the greatest miracle they had ever seen (Exodus 15:11).
        -   [WB]: Red Sea Miracle -> 3 Days -> Marah (Complaint)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Their faith was shallow, based on positive events, not on a deep relationship with their Deliverer. The moment circumstances became difficult, their praise evaporated and turned into complaint. This reveals a character that is not yet sanctified, one that walks by sight and feeling, not by faith.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What is the very first thing the people do when they face a problem, just three days after God parted the sea for them?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 16:2-3
        -   Reading/Connection: "Then the whole congregation... **complained** against Moses and Aaron... 'Oh, that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate bread to the full! For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.'"
        -   [WB]: Complaint -> Forgetfulness -> False Memory (Egypt)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The pattern repeats. The problem changes from thirst to hunger, but the heart-reaction is identical. Notice how unbelief distorts memory—they romanticize their brutal slavery and forget the power of their Deliverer.
        -   [EGW]: "They forgot their bitter service in Egypt. They forgot the goodness and power of God displayed in their behalf... They saw and felt only their present inconveniences and trials..." (CC 94.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Sister White says their faith was dependent on circumstances and they 'felt only their present inconveniences.' What does a faith like that look like in our lives today?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a small child walking with their father through a dark, unfamiliar forest. One child holds the father's hand tightly, trusting him completely, asking, "Where are we going next, Dad?" The other child, just as safe, cries and complains with every step, "Why did you bring me here? Are we lost? I'm scared!" Israel was acting like the second child. God was testing which child they would choose to be.
        -   Connecting to Life: Our trials are the "dark forest." Our response reveals whether we are clinging to our Father's hand in trust or complaining in unbelief.

#### B. The Core Question of Unbelief (Est. 7-9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 17:1-3
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Then all the congregation... camped in Rephidim; but there was no water... Therefore the people **contended** with Moses... 'Why is it you have brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?'"
        -   [WB]: Complained -> Contended -> Accused
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Notice the dangerous progression. "Complained" in chapters 15 and 16 has now hardened into "contended" (to quarrel, to strive). Unbelief, when cherished, does not remain static; it hardens the heart and leads to open rebellion.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Exodus 17:7
        -   Reading/Context: "So he called the name of the place Massah [Testing] and Meribah [Quarreling]... because they tempted the LORD, saying, **'Is the LORD among us or not?'**"
        -   Deeper Insight: This, brothers and sisters, is the root question of all unbelief. After the pillar of cloud, the parted sea, the sweet water, the bread from heaven—they still ask, "Is God really with us?" This is a profound insult to the character of a loving, ever-present God.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "In what subtle ways might we ask this same question—'Is the Lord among us or not?'—when we face a job loss, a health crisis, or family trouble?"

### III. The Divine Textbook: Provision that Points to Christ (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Now let's turn to God's response. His provision was never just about meeting a physical need. It was always a deeper lesson, a living parable designed to teach them about the true Source of life and the nature of saving faith.

#### A. The Cross and the Rock in the Wilderness (Est. 8-9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 15:25-26
        -   Reading/Context: "So he [Moses] cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a **tree**. When he cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet. There He made a statute... and there He **tested** them, and said, 'If you diligently heed the voice of the LORD your God... I am the LORD who heals you.'"
        -   [WB]: Tree -> Sweet Water -> Healing
        -   Unpacking the Truth: It was not a magic tree. It was a divine symbol. A tree, an instrument of death, was used to bring life and sweetness to the bitter waters of their trial. This points unmistakably forward to the tree of Calvary—the cross of Christ, which alone can sweeten the bitter experiences of our sinful lives.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* This is like a divine prescription. The disease is a bitter, complaining heart. The prescription is simple obedience and trust ("diligently heed"). The Healer is the Lord Himself. The tree is the symbol of the only effective medicine—the sacrifice of Christ.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 10:4
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul pulls back the veil for us: "...and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and **that Rock was Christ**."
        -   [WB]: Spiritual Rock = CHRIST
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The rock at Horeb wasn't just a geological formation; it was a physical manifestation of the Son of God. When they contended for water, they were contending with Christ Himself.
        -   [EGW]: "In smiting Christ, Satan thought to destroy the Prince of life; but from the smitten rock there flowed living water." (DA 454.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Knowing that 'the Rock was Christ' changes how we read Exodus 17. What were the Israelites *really* doing when they quarreled about the lack of water?"

#### B. The Bread of Heaven and the Life of Faith (Est. 7-8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 16:4
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Then the LORD said to Moses, 'Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota **every day**, that I may **test** them, whether they will walk in My law or not.'"
        -   [WB]: Daily Bread -> Daily Trust -> Daily Test
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The manna was not just food; it was a daily **test** of dependence and obedience. They could not hoard it. They could not rely on yesterday's provision. They were forced to trust God for the very next day. This is the essence of a sanctified life of faith.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Why do you think God specifically designed the manna so it had to be gathered fresh every single day (except for the Sabbath)?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** John 6:35, 48-51
        -   Reading/Connection: Jesus Himself gives the divine commentary: "**I am the bread of life**. He who comes to Me shall never hunger... Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die... the bread that I shall give is My flesh..."
        -   The Ultimate Fulfillment: Jesus is the reality to which the manna pointed. The manna sustained physical life temporarily. Christ gives eternal life. To "eat" this bread is to internalize His word, His character, and His sacrifice through a living faith.
        -   [EGW]: "The manna, falling from heaven for the sustenance of Israel, was a type of Him who came from God to give life to the world." (PP 297.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "If 'eating' the Bread of Life means internalizing Christ's word and character, what does a 'daily gathering' of this spiritual manna look like for us in the 21st century?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that the wilderness was God's school. The curriculum was crisis. The purpose was to expose the fatal disease of unbelief and teach the only cure: moment-by-moment dependence on Christ, our true Rock and our true Bread from heaven.
-   Character Focus Recap: God is infinitely more interested in our **character** than our comfort. He allows the "Marahs" and "Rephidims" in our lives to perfect our faith and trust, making us fit citizens for the Heavenly Canaan.
    -   [WB]: `CHARACTER > COMFORT`
-   Call to Action/Decision: The next time you face a trial—a bitter disappointment, a lack of resources—I appeal to you to recognize it as a class in session at the Wilderness School. Will you murmur and ask, "Is the Lord among us?" Or will you cry out to Him and look for the "tree," the "rock," the "manna"—the all-sufficient provision of Christ?
    -   [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `"TRUST & OBEY"`
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Israel's journey was recorded for us, "on whom the ends of the ages have come" (1 Cor. 10:11). We are in the final stages of our wilderness journey. Let us learn the lesson they so often failed to learn. Let us feed daily on the Bread of Life and drink deeply from the smitten Rock, so that our characters may be perfected and we may be ready to enter our Promised Land.
    -   [WB]: Final Hope phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS"` (Heb. 12:2)
