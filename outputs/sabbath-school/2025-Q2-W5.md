## The Nations: Part 2 - The Failure of Self-Rule and the Triumph of God's Kingdom

**Overarching Theme:** The **profound** contrast between the inevitable failure and chaos of human self-governance (the "sea" of nations) and the ultimate, eternal triumph of God's righteous government (the "land" and His Kingdom) as revealed in prophecy.
**Central Focus:** Recognizing the prophetic pattern of human failure as an urgent call to choose **personal allegiance** to Christ's rule now, developing characters fit for His eternal kingdom amidst end-time deception.
**Key Texts:** Daniel 2:44-45, Daniel 7:27, Revelation 13:11, Revelation 10:11

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Why does world history seem like a constant cycle of conflict, rising powers, and eventual decay? Does God offer a different path?
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: The Great Controversy Between Christ's Government and Human Self-Rule. This isn't just history; it's a revelation of two opposing principles with eternal consequences.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Human Rule vs. God's Rule)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding this conflict is **CRITICAL** for us today. It reveals why choosing God's rule *personally* and allowing Him to develop His character in us is essential preparation for citizenship in His coming eternal kingdom. Our allegiance determines our destiny.
-   Roadmap: We'll trace this theme from Eden's choice, through the prophetic history of nations, to the final deceptions, and ultimately to God's final call and glorious victory.

### II. Eden's Choice, Babel's Echo: The Foundation of Self-Rule (8 mins)
-   **A. The First Command & The Choice for Self:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's first command (Gen 2:16-17) was a test of loyalty based on loving trust, offering life under His perfect guidance. Choosing the forbidden fruit was choosing self-rule based on Satan's deceptive promise of wisdom apart from God. This is the **root** of all rebellion.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 2:16-17 - God's clear boundary; Gen 3:4-6 - The serpent's lie, the choice for self-determination.
    -   EGW Insight: "The Garden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson book, the Creator Himself was the instructor..." (Ed 20). Humanity rejected the Divine Teacher.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The inherent human tendency to distrust God and desire independence leads to separation and ruin.

-   **B. The Spirit of Babel: Organized Rebellion:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Babel (Gen 11) represents humanity's organized effort to establish unity, security, and glory **apart from God**, directly opposing His plan. This spirit of self-sufficient, rebellious human government animates the kingdoms of prophecy.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 11:4 - "Let us make a name for ourselves..."
    -   EGW Insight: Sin is "the transgression of the law;" it is "the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine government." (GC 492). Babel embodied this principle.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Pride and the desire for human systems of control hinder submission to God's ways.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A child insisting on walking alone near a busy road, rejecting the parent's protective hand – choosing perceived freedom over safety under guidance.
-   *Hypothetical:* Trying to build a global network based purely on human agreements without a unifying, trustworthy authority – destined for fragmentation and conflict.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* EDEN: Choice / BABEL: Rebellion
-   *Diagram:* Tree (Choice) -> Tower (Self-Rule) -> Chaos
-   *Verse:* Gen 2:17 / Gen 11:4
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...at war with the law of love." (GC 492)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* What was the core desire expressed by the builders of Babel in Genesis 11:4?
-   *(Reflection):* How does the desire to "make a name for ourselves" or rely on human systems instead of God show up today?
-   *(Application):* What's one area in our lives where we might be tempted to trust our own plans or human solutions more than God's guidance?

### III. The Unfolding Drama: Kingdoms Rise and Fall (Daniel 2 & 7) (10 mins)
-   **A. Prophecy's Verdict: A Pattern of Deterioration:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Both Daniel 2 (image of metals) and Daniel 7 (beasts from the sea) reveal God's foreknowledge of the history of human empires. **Crucially**, they show a consistent pattern: a decline in value, moral strength, and stability as nations forget God and rely on human power.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 2:31-43 (Gold -> Silver -> Brass -> Iron -> Iron/Clay); Dan 7:1-8 (Lion -> Bear -> Leopard -> Terrible Beast).
    -   EGW Insight: "As nations forget God, in like proportion they become weak morally... They deteriorated because they cast off their allegiance to God." (YI, Sep 22, 1903, par. 4-5).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Placing hope in earthly powers is futile; they are inherently flawed and temporary.

-   **B. The Turbulent "Sea" of Nations:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The beasts rising from the "sea" (Dan 7:2-3) symbolize the origin of Gentile nations in turmoil, strife, and the chaos of peoples alienated from God's stable government ("land"). Their existence is marked by conflict.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 7:2-3; Isa 17:12-13 (Nations like rushing waters); Rev 17:15 ("Waters... are peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues").
    -   EGW Insight: "While the nations rejected God's principles, and in this rejection wrought their own ruin, it was still manifest that the divine, overruling purpose was working through all their movements." (Ed 177). God remains sovereign over the chaos.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Worldly distractions and the apparent power of nations can blind us to their spiritual weakness and temporary nature.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Like building materials getting progressively weaker and less reliable – gold is precious and strong, but iron mixed with clay is brittle and cannot hold together.
-   *Metaphor:* The restless, chaotic, often destructive sea compared to the stability and firmness of land under God's control.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* DETERIORATION / TURMOIL
-   *Diagram:* Downward Arrow (Gold -> Clay) / Waves (Sea = Nations)
-   *Verse:* Dan 2:42-43 / Dan 7:3
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...weak morally." (YI)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* In Daniel 2, what happens to the quality of the metals from the head to the feet? What might this represent?
-   *(Reflection):* Why is the symbol of the "sea" fitting for the origin and nature of the kingdoms described in Daniel 7?
-   *(Application):* How does understanding this prophetic pattern of decay help us set our priorities and focus on the coming eternal kingdom?

### IV. The End-Time Deception: When "Land" Speaks Like the "Sea" (Revelation 13) (10 mins) [*]
-   **A. The Rise of the Lamblike Beast:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: A unique power arises, not from the "sea" of Old World conflict, but from the "earth" (Rev 13:11) - symbolizing a new area, initially promoting peace and liberty (like a lamb). This points prophetically to the United States.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 13:11 - "coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb..."
    -   EGW Insight: "The beast was seen 'coming up out of the earth;'... the nation must arise in territory previously unoccupied and grow up gradually and peacefully... It points unmistakably to the United States of America." (GC 440).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Discernment is crucial. Appearances can be deceiving; we must test everything by God's Word.

-   **B. The Shocking Contradiction: Speaking Like a Dragon:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The **critical** warning: this same power, despite its lamblike appearance and profession, will ultimately speak "as a dragon" (Rev 13:11). It will use its influence ("legislative and judicial authorities" - GC 442) to enforce false worship and coerce conscience, betraying its founding principles. This is a final test of allegiance to God.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 13:11-17 - Speaks like a dragon, exercises power of the first beast, causes worship of the first beast/image, enforces a mark.
    -   EGW Insight: "The prediction that it will speak 'as a dragon' and exercise 'all the power of the first beast' plainly foretells a development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution... Such action would be directly contrary to the principles of this government..." (GC 442).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: We must be prepared for pressure to compromise God's commandments, particularly the Sabbath, stemming from an unexpected source. Our loyalty must be solely to Christ.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A wolf disguised in sheep's clothing – looks harmless but is dangerous.
-   *Hypothetical Example:* Imagine a nation founded on freedom suddenly enacting laws that restrict religious practice based on popular pressure or political expediency.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* DECEPTION / ALLEGIANCE
-   *Diagram:* Lamb -> Dragon (Speech Bubble)
-   *Verse:* Rev 13:11 / Rev 13:16-17 (Mark)
-   *Question:* Whose Voice Will You Obey?

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* What is the major contradiction described in Revelation 13:11 regarding the second beast?
-   *(Reflection):* Why might a power that *looks* like a lamb but *speaks* like a dragon be particularly deceptive in the last days?
-   *(Application):* What practical steps can we take **now** to strengthen our faith and understanding so we are not deceived when these pressures come?

### V. God's Final Call and Unshakeable Kingdom (7 mins)
-   **A. The Mandate to "Prophesy Again":**
    -   Core Teaching Point: In the face of final deceptions and the culmination of human rebellion, Christ Himself (the Mighty Angel of Rev 10) empowers His end-time people. With the prophecies of Daniel now unsealed ("little book open"), we are commissioned to carry His final message of warning and hope to **all** the world – both the turbulent "sea" and the deceptive "land."
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 10:1-2, 11 - Angel with open book, standing on sea and land, commands "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."
    -   EGW Insight: "The mighty angel who instructed John was no less a personage than Jesus Christ... His position denotes His supreme power and authority over the whole earth... He is to show the power and authority of His voice to those who have united with Satan to oppose the truth." (7BC 971). This is our urgent task.
    -   Application/Reliance on God: This global mission is possible only through Christ's power and authority.

-   **B. The Unconquerable, Eternal Kingdom:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Despite the apparent triumph of evil and the failure of human kingdoms, God's ultimate victory is **certain**. The "stone cut out without hands" (Dan 2:44-45) represents Christ's divine kingdom, which will utterly demolish all earthly powers and stand forever. This is our blessed hope.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 2:34-35, 44-45 - The stone strikes the image, it becomes dust, the stone becomes a mountain filling the earth; God's kingdom "shall never be destroyed... it shall stand forever."
    -   EGW Insight: "The fire that consumes the wicked purifies the earth... One reminder alone remains: our Redeemer will ever bear the marks of His crucifixion... the wounds of Calvary will show forth His praise and declare His power." (GC 674). Sin's tragedy ends in eternal glory through Christ.
    -   Application/Connection to Eternal Outcomes: Our present faithfulness and character development directly relate to our citizenship in this coming, unshakeable kingdom.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A lighthouse keeper faithfully tending the light to warn ships, knowing a storm is coming but also that the lighthouse stands on solid rock.
-   *Metaphor:* Comparing the crumbling statue made by human hands to the eternal, unshakeable mountain of God's kingdom.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* PROPHESY AGAIN / GOD'S KINGDOM
-   *Diagram:* Angel (Rev 10) -> World / Stone (Dan 2) -> Crushing Image
-   *Verse:* Rev 10:11 / Dan 2:44
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...it shall stand forever."

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* According to Daniel 2:44, what is the ultimate fate of all earthly kingdoms compared to God's kingdom?
-   *(Reflection):* How does the command to "prophesy again" (Rev 10:11) connect with the prophecies of Daniel we've studied? Why is this message so urgent now?
-   *(Application):* What is one practical way you can participate in sharing God's final message, whether through words, actions, or character?

### VI. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: We've seen the clear prophetic testimony: human attempts at self-rule, born in Eden's choice and echoed at Babel, lead inevitably to moral decay, chaos ("sea"), and ultimately, deceptive coercion ("dragon's voice"). But God's plan **will not fail**.
-   Character Focus Recap: The **vital** question is: Under which government are you choosing to live **today**? Allegiance to Christ's kingdom must be demonstrated now through surrender, obedience, and a character being transformed into His likeness by His grace. This is fitness for heaven.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFUL ALLEGIANCE)*
    -   EGW Insight: "We shall follow the Lamb of God in the courts above only if we follow Him here." (7BC 978).
-   Call to Action/Decision: Let us consciously choose Christ's rule over self daily. Let us study His Word diligently (the "open book"). Let us cooperate with the Holy Spirit in perfecting characters ready to meet Him.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: CHOOSE / PREPARE / FOLLOW)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What one aspect of Christ's character will you ask Him to develop more fully in you this week?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The nations rage, deception increases, but "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth!" (Ps 46:10). His kingdom is coming soon! Let us be found faithful.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Ps 46:10 / HE IS COMING!)*
