**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Have you ever wondered why history seems like a relentless cycle of conflict, rising powers, and eventual decay? Is there a deeper pattern, a divine perspective revealed in Scripture?
-   Theme Introduction: Today, we delve into a **profound** biblical theme: the age-old conflict between **God's loving sovereignty** and **humanity's persistent choice for self-rule (rebellion)**. Understanding this from God's Word is **CRITICAL** for navigating our times and preparing our characters.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "God's Rule or Ours? History's Great Choice"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just about ancient kingdoms; it's about the core choice facing every soul. Which government rules *your* heart? Our response determines our character fitness for God's eternal kingdom and our readiness for His soon return.
    -   [EGW]: "Sin is an intruder, for whose presence no reason can be given... it is 'the transgression of the law;' it is the outworking of a principle at war with the great law of love which is the foundation of the divine government." (GC 492.2).
-   Roadmap: We'll examine the origin of this choice in Eden, see its consequences unfold in the prophetic history of nations (Daniel 2 & 7), understand key prophetic symbols (Land/Sea), and grasp our urgent calling today (Revelation 10).

### II. The Foundation Laid: Eden's Choice & History's Trajectory (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Let's go back to the beginning, where the fundamental choice between God's government and self-government was first presented. This choice echoes through all subsequent history.

#### A. The Edenic Test: Loyalty or Rebellion? (Est. 7-8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 2:16-17
        -   Reading/Context: God gives Adam abundant freedom but one clear command – a test of loyalty and trust in His wisdom.
        -   [WB]: Gen 2:17 - "Do Not Eat" = Test of Allegiance
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This wasn't about limiting knowledge arbitrarily. It was about recognizing God as the rightful Ruler and source of all true wisdom. Choosing the forbidden tree meant choosing self as god, trusting one's own judgment above God's Word.
        -   [EGW]: "The Garden of Eden was the schoolroom, nature was the lesson book, the Creator Himself was the instructor..." (Ed 20.1). God intended to teach, but within the bounds of loving obedience.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "What was the core principle being tested by the command in Genesis 2:17? Was it just about fruit?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Genesis 3:5-6 (Implied context for the Fall)
        -   Reading/Connection: The serpent's lie ("you will be like God") directly targeted this choice: reject God's authority, define good and evil for yourself. This is the essence of rebellion.
        -   [WB]: Rebellion = Self-Rule -> Chaos
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The desire for self-exaltation, born in Lucifer [EGW: PP 35.2], became humanity's downfall. This highlights our inherent struggle against pride and the desperate need for humility and dependence on God for true wisdom and character development.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does Satan's temptation in Genesis 3 reveal the root motivation behind rejecting God's command?"

#### B. Human Kingdoms: A Prophesied Decline (Est. 8-10 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Daniel 2:31-35
        -   Reading/Context: God reveals to Nebuchadnezzar (a symbol of human power) the future course of world empires after Babylon.
        -   [WB]: Dan 2: Gold -> Silver -> Bronze -> Iron -> Iron/Clay
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The image shows a **decline** in value (moral worth, connection to divine principles) even as hardness/force might increase. This is God's assessment of history under human rule, stemming from the initial rejection of His sovereignty.
        -   [EGW]: "As nations forget God, in like proportion they become weak morally... They deteriorated because they cast off their allegiance to God. As they forgot him, they sank lower and still lower in the scale of moral value." (YI, Sep 22, 1903, par. 4-5).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...forgot God... sank lower..."
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "What does the decreasing value of the metals in Daniel 2 tell us about God's view of human history apart from Him?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine building a magnificent house. If you choose shifting sand (human wisdom, power, self-interest) as your foundation instead of solid rock (God's unchanging principles), eventual collapse is inevitable, no matter how impressive it looks initially. Daniel 2 shows this inevitable decay.
        -   Connecting to Life: This isn't just history; it reflects personal choices. Building our lives on anything other than God's Word leads to instability and ultimate failure in developing a Christlike character.
    -   **Foundation Text 4 (Outcome):** Daniel 2:44-45
        -   Reading/Challenge: Amidst the crumbling human kingdoms, God reveals His ultimate plan: a divine kingdom that will shatter all others and stand forever.
        -   [WB]: Dan 2:44 - God's Kingdom -> EVERLASTING
        -   Practical Step: The contrast is stark. We must consciously choose which kingdom we belong to, aligning our will, thoughts, and actions with God's principles daily. This requires constant surrender and reliance on His power.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing the outcome prophesied in Daniel 2:44, how should this impact our priorities and where we place our ultimate trust and allegiance today?"

### III. The Character of Nations & God's Final Call (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Daniel 7 and Revelation give us a deeper look into the *character* of these human powers born from rebellion, contrasting them sharply with God's ways and revealing His final movements in the Great Controversy.

#### A. Beasts from the Sea: The Nature of Human Rule (Est. 8-9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Daniel 7:1-3, 17
        -   Reading/Context: Daniel sees four great beasts (kings/kingdoms) rising from the "great sea," stirred by winds (strife).
        -   [WB]: Dan 7: Sea = Peoples/Nations (Rev 17:15) -> Turmoil/Strife
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The "sea" in prophecy often represents populated areas, specifically the Gentile nations in their restless, chaotic state, driven by ambition and conflict (Isa 17:12-13). These kingdoms arise through conquest and political upheaval, reflecting the fallen nature inherited from Eden.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "What does the origin of the beasts ('from the sea') suggest about the nature and stability of earthly kingdoms according to prophecy?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Daniel 7:4-8, 19-25 (Focus on characteristics)
        -   Reading/Connection: Describe the predatory, power-hungry nature of the beasts (lion, bear, leopard, terrifying beast with iron teeth, little horn speaking blasphemies and persecuting saints).
        -   [WB]: Beasts = Predatory, Prideful, Persecuting
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This imagery starkly contrasts with the character of Christ and His kingdom (meekness, love, truth, service). It reveals the fruits of self-rule: pride, oppression, defiance against God. Our characters must be transformed *away* from these beastly principles towards Christlikeness.
        -   [EGW]: "While the nations rejected God's principles, and in this rejection wrought their own ruin, it was still manifest that the divine, overruling purpose was working through all their movements." (Ed 177.1). God remains sovereign even amidst rebellion.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How do the characteristics of the beasts in Daniel 7 contrast with the principles of God's kingdom (e.g., Matthew 5:3-12)?"

#### B. Land, Sea, and the Final Deception (Est. 7-8 mins) [*]
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Revelation 13:1
        -   Reading/Context: A composite beast (combining Dan 7 elements) rises from the "sea" – representing papal Rome, inheriting the characteristics of previous empires born of strife.
        -   [WB]: Rev 13:1 - Sea Beast (Papacy)
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 12:15-16 & Revelation 13:11
        -   Reading/Connection: The dragon (Satan) uses a flood ("water," symbol of peoples/armies) against the woman (church). The "earth" (representing a place of refuge, initially less populated or established on different principles) helps the woman. Then, another beast arises from the "earth" (USA).
        -   [WB]: Earth (Rev 12:16; 13:11) = Refuge -> USA -> Speaks like Dragon
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The "earth" initially offers refuge (like the founding of America for religious freedom). However, this "lamblike" power eventually speaks "like a dragon," adopting the coercive, persecuting principles of the previous "sea" powers. This shows how even nations founded on better ideals can succumb to the spirit of rebellion against God's law of love and liberty of conscience.
        -   [EGW]: "The beast was seen 'coming up out of the earth;'... the nation must arise in territory previously unoccupied... It points unmistakably to the United States of America." (GC 440.1). "The prediction that it will speak 'as a dragon'... plainly foretells a development of the spirit of intolerance and persecution..." (GC 442.2).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of counterfeit currency. It might look genuine initially (lamblike horns), but its underlying nature (dragon's voice) is false and deceptive, leading people away from the true standard (God's law).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application/Reflection):* "According to Revelation 13 and [EGW], how can a nation initially founded on principles of freedom end up promoting coercion? What warning does this hold for us personally regarding compromise?"
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Revelation 10:11
        -   Reading/Challenge: Despite the rise and fall and corruption of nations, God gives His end-time people a renewed mandate: "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."
        -   [WB]: Rev 10:11 - "Prophesy Again!" - Our Mandate
        -   Practical Step: Our task is not political reform but proclaiming God's final warning message (Rev 14), calling people *out* of allegiance to rebellious systems and *into* allegiance to the Creator and His coming kingdom, fostering characters fit for that kingdom.

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture the tragic trajectory of human self-rule originating in Eden's choice, prophesied in Daniel, and culminating in end-time deceptions. But we've also seen God's unwavering sovereignty and His ultimate plan for an eternal kingdom.
-   Character Focus Recap: The history of nations underscores the **biblical** call to reject pride, rebellion, and coercion. We are called to develop characters reflecting God's **law of love**, marked by humility, faithfulness, and obedience through Christ's power, ready for His pure kingdom.
    -   [WB]: Character Goal: `HUMILITY` / `FAITHFULNESS` / `OBEDIENCE`
-   Call to Action/Decision: Which government are you choosing daily? The crumbling kingdom of self, reflected in the world's ways, or the everlasting kingdom of God? Let us heed the **scriptural** call to "Be still, and know that I am God" (Ps 46:10) and surrender our wills fully to Him.
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: ```"CHOOSE GOD'S RULE"``` (cf. Joshua 24:15)
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Based on God's Word today, what is one specific area where you will consciously choose God's way over self-will this week, trusting His power?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The signs declare the end is near [EGW: ARSH Nov 23, 1905, par. 6-7]. Human kingdoms will pass away. Let us anchor our hope firmly in the **biblical** promise of Christ's return and His eternal kingdom of righteousness, where "the great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire universe is clean." (GC 678 - adapted context).
    -   [WB]: Final Hope: ```Daniel 2:44``` / ```"HIS KINGDOM SHALL STAND FOREVER"```
