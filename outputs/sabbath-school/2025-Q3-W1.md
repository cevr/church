# 2025 Q3 W1 - June 28-July 4
## Oppression: The Background and the Birth of Moses

**Overarching Theme:** God's Unseen Hand: Forging Character in the Crucible of Crisis
**Central Focus:** To understand that God is sovereignly working to fulfill His promises and perfect His people's character, even when circumstances seem hopeless and His hand appears hidden.
**Key Texts:** Exodus 1:12, Exodus 2:23-25, Hebrews 11:24-26

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Have you ever been in a situation that seemed to be getting worse and worse, and you wondered, "Where is God in this?" The story of Israel in Egypt begins in just such a place—a place of darkness, oppression, and apparent divine silence.
-   Theme Introduction: Today, we will look behind the scenes of this crisis. Our theme is **God's Unseen Hand: Forging Character in the Crucible of Crisis**. We will see from Scripture that even in the deepest trial, God is not absent. He is actively working, fulfilling His promises and, most importantly, shaping characters fit for His kingdom.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "God's Unseen Hand"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just ancient history. God uses the same methods today to prepare us for the final crisis and for eternity. Understanding His purpose in trials is essential for our sanctification and our readiness for Christ's return.
-   Roadmap: We will first examine the national crisis in Exodus 1 to see God's faithfulness to His people as a whole. Then, we will zoom in on the personal crisis in Exodus 2 to see how God prepares an individual for His divine purpose.

### II. The Furnace of Affliction: God's Purpose for a People (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Let's turn to Exodus chapter 1. A new king arises who does not know Joseph, and God's people are plunged into slavery. From a human perspective, God's plan seems to have failed. But let's see what the Bible says God was actually doing.

#### A. The Paradox of Providence ({Est. 8-10 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 1:7
        -   Reading/Context: "But the children of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly, multiplied and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land was filled with them." This is the fulfillment of the promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
        -   [WB]: Genesis Promise -> Exodus 1:7 Fulfillment
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Before the trouble, God was already keeping His word. The blessing of multiplication is what provoked the fear of Pharaoh.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What contrast do you see between verse 7, which describes God's blessing, and verse 8, which describes Pharaoh's reaction?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 1:12
        -   Reading/Connection: "But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were in dread of the children of Israel."
        -   [WB]: Affliction ↑ = Multiplication ↑
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is a divine paradox. Pharaoh's plan to diminish Israel becomes the very instrument God uses to increase them. This was to teach Israel—and us—that no human power can thwart God's ultimate purpose. Their greatest need was to trust God when human logic saw only despair.
        -   [EGW]: "Yet policy forbade their banishment from the country. Many of them were able and understanding workmen, and they added greatly to the wealth of the nation... Accordingly he ranked them with the Egyptians who had sold themselves... Soon taskmasters were set over them, and their slavery became complete." (PP 241).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think God often works in ways that seem opposite to our human expectations, like bringing growth through affliction?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* This is like a blacksmith forging a piece of steel. To the steel, the hammer's blows are violent and destructive. But the blacksmith knows that each strike is making the steel stronger, purer, and shaping it for a specific, high purpose. God was forging a nation in the furnace of Egypt.

#### B. The Power of Godly Fear ({Est. 7-8 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 3 & 4:** Exodus 1:17, 20-21
        -   Reading/Context: "But the midwives **feared God**, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them... Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and grew very mighty. And so it was, because the midwives feared God, that He provided households for them."
        -   [WB]: Fear God > Fear Man
        -   Unpacking the Truth: In the middle of this national crisis, the faithfulness of two women, Shiphrah and Puah, becomes a turning point. Their fear of God was greater than their fear of the most powerful man on earth. This is the character God is looking for.
        -   [EGW]: "Satan was the mover in this matter. He knew that a deliverer was to be raised up among the Israelites; and by leading the king to destroy their children he hoped to defeat the divine purpose. But the women feared God, and dared not execute the cruel mandate." (PP 242).
        -   [WB]: Satan's Plan vs. God's Servants
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The midwives had to make a choice between obeying a human law and obeying God. In what modern-day situations might we face a similar choice, and what can we learn from their example?"

### III. The School of Providence: God's Preparation of a Person (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** The crisis intensifies with the decree to kill all male infants. Satan's attack becomes more direct. But God's unseen hand is now focusing on preparing a specific person—a deliverer. This is the story of Moses' education, not in the courts of Egypt, but in the school of God.

#### A. The Failure of Human Wisdom ({Est. 8-9 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 1 & 2:** Exodus 2:10, 11-12
        -   Reading/Context: "And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son... Now it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren and looked at their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew... so he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand."
        -   [WB]: Egypt's Prince -> Impulsive Murderer
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Moses received the best education the world could offer. He had position, power, and knowledge. He had a heart for his people. But he tried to accomplish God's work using the world's methods: violence and human strength. It was a complete failure.
        -   [EGW]: "He made a miserable failure of his first attempt. Like many another, he then immediately lost his confidence in God, and turned his back upon his appointed work; he fled from the wrath of Pharaoh." (FCE 342).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Moses' intentions were good, but his method was wrong. How can we, even in church work, be tempted to use 'worldly' methods to achieve 'spiritual' goals?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like trying to perform delicate heart surgery with a sledgehammer. The tool is powerful, but it's the wrong tool for the job and will only cause destruction. Moses' Egyptian training was a sledgehammer; God needed to spend 40 years in the desert reshaping him into a surgeon's scalpel.

#### B. The Curriculum of Unlearning and Trusting ({Est. 7-8 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 11:24-26
        -   Reading/Context: "By faith Moses, when he became of age, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt."
        -   [WB]: Refused -> Chose -> Esteemed
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The first step in God's true education for Moses was a choice. He had to **unlearn** the value system of Egypt and **learn** to see with eternal eyes. This choice, this act of faith, was more important than all his 40 years of worldly learning.
        -   [EGW]: "The lessons learned at his mother's side could not be forgotten. They were a shield from the pride, the infidelity, and the vice that flourished amid the splendor of the court." (PP 244).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "According to Hebrews 11, what was Moses' motivation for choosing affliction over treasure? What does 'the reproach of Christ' mean in this context?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Exodus 2:23-25
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Now it happened in the process of time that the king of Egypt died. Then the children of Israel groaned because of the bondage, and they cried out... So God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant... And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God acknowledged them."
        -   [WB]: Groaned -> Cried -> God Heard -> Remembered -> Looked -> Acknowledged
        -   Practical Step: While Moses was being prepared, the people were also being prepared. Their suffering finally drove them to cry out to God. God's timing is perfect. He waits until both the people and the leader are ready. Our part is to cry out to Him, trusting that He hears and is working, even when we can't see it.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "This passage shows a turning point when the people cried out. What does it take for us to move from silent suffering to actively crying out to God for deliverance in our own lives?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from Scripture that God is never idle. In national crisis, He used the enemy's affliction to fulfill His promise of multiplication (Ex. 1:12). In personal crisis, He used 40 years of failure and exile to strip away worldly pride and forge a humble, faithful leader (Ex. 2).
-   Character Focus Recap: The goal of God's unseen work is always the restoration of His image in us. He is less concerned with our comfort than with our **character**. The midwives' fear of God, Jochebed's faith, and Moses' ultimate surrender are the character traits God is developing in us today.
    -   [WB]: `FAITHFULNESS`
-   Call to Action/Decision: The question for us is the same one Moses faced: Will we choose the education of this world—its treasures, its methods, its pride? Or will we, by faith, choose to enter God's school of humility and trust, even if it means "suffering affliction"?
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: ```"CHOOSE" (Heb. 11:25)```
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* Based on God's Word today, what is one area of "Egyptian thinking" you need to ask God to help you unlearn this week?
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Moses' 80 years of preparation may seem long, but God's timing was perfect. He is preparing us now for the final deliverance. Let us trust His process, for He who has promised is faithful.
    -   [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: ```"GOD ACKNOWLEDGED THEM" (Ex. 2:25)```
