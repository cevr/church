# 2025 Q4 W9 - November 22-28
## Heirs of Promises, Prisoners of Hope

**Overarching Theme:** Possessing the Promise: The Divine-Human Partnership in Salvation
**Central Focus:** To understand from Scripture that God’s promises (symbolized by Canaan) are received by grace but possessed through active, obedient faith, which is the very process of character sanctification required for the heavenly inheritance.
**Key Texts:** Deuteronomy 9:4-6; Joshua 13:1; Philippians 2:12-13

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Imagine being given the deed to a magnificent, fully-paid-for estate. The gift is yours, free and clear. But what must you still do to truly enjoy it? You must travel there, unlock the door, move in, and make it your home. The gift is free, but possession requires action. This is the story of Israel and Canaan, and it is our story today.
-   Theme Introduction: This week, we move beyond simply knowing about God’s promises to understanding the profound biblical principle of **possessing** them. The Bible teaches a dynamic partnership: God’s sovereign gift and our required response of faith-filled action.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Possessing the Promise: A Partnership of Faith"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This process of "possessing" is not about earning salvation; it is the very definition of sanctification. It is how God, through our cooperation, refines our characters to make us fit citizens for the ultimate Promised Land—the New Earth.
-   Roadmap: We will first explore the biblical nature of God’s promise as a pure gift. Then, we will examine the scriptural call for our active participation in possessing that gift.

### II. The Divine Promise: A Gift of Grace, Not a Right of Merit (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Before we can talk about our part, we must be absolutely grounded in what God's part is. The foundation of everything is His grace—His unmerited, unearned initiative.

#### A. The Unconditional Source and Conditional Blessing (9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 13:14-15
        -   Reading/Context: After Lot chooses the well-watered plain, God speaks to Abram, who is left with what seems to be the lesser portion. God gives him a promise not based on Abram's choice or merit, but on God's sovereign will.
        -   [WB]: Genesis 13:15 "To thee will I give it"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The promise originates entirely with God. It is a gift of grace. Abram did nothing to deserve it. This is the foundation of our salvation—it is a gift, "not of works, lest any man should boast" (Eph. 2:9).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "In this initial promise to Abram, what conditions did God place on him? What does this tell us about the *source* of the promise?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2 & 3:** Deuteronomy 9:5-6
        -   Reading/Connection: Centuries later, as Israel is about to enter Canaan, Moses reminds them of this same principle. He explicitly tells them *why* they are NOT getting the land.
        -   [WB]: "NOT for thy righteousness..."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is a direct assault on human pride. The greatest danger for God's people is to think our blessings are a result of our own goodness. This leads to self-righteousness, the very character trait that cannot enter heaven. God gives the gift to the undeserving to keep us humble and dependent on Him.
        -   [EGW]: "[EGW] But if God's people followed His instruction, their land would be restored to fertility and beauty... As in obedience to His natural laws the earth should produce its treasures, so in obedience to His moral law the hearts of the people were to reflect the attributes of His character." (COL 289.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does the truth in Deuteronomy 9—that God’s gift is not based on our righteousness—actually protect our character from pride and help us reflect His?"

#### B. God's Ownership and Our Stewardship (7 mins) [*]
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Leviticus 25:23
        -   Reading/Context: In the laws for the Jubilee, God gives the foundational reason why land could not be permanently sold.
        -   [WB]: Diagram: God (Owner) -> Man (Sojourner/Steward)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: We never truly "own" anything; we are stewards. The land belonged to God. Salvation belongs to God. Our lives, our time, our resources—they are His. This perspective transforms our relationship with Him from one of entitlement to one of grateful responsibility.
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a master artist giving you his finest violin. It's an incredible gift. But to enjoy its true purpose—to create beautiful music—you must follow his instructions, practice diligently, and care for the instrument. The gift is free, but its blessing is realized through obedient cooperation. Our salvation is like that violin.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "If we view our lives, talents, and even our salvation as things God owns and has entrusted to us (like the violin), how does that change the way we approach our daily decisions and struggles?"

### III. The Human Response: Possessing by Faith and Obedience (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** God gives the deed to the land. But a deed in your hand is not the same as a home you live in. Now we turn to the Bible's clear instruction on our role: to get up, go in, and possess the inheritance by faith.

#### A. The Unfinished Task of Possession (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 13:1
        -   Reading/Context: Joshua is old, the major battles have been won, and the land has been "given." Yet God says, "There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed."
        -   [WB]: Promise GIVEN vs. Land POSSESSED
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God had fulfilled His part—He defeated their enemies and legally gave them the land. But the Israelites had to physically go in, drive out the remaining pockets of resistance, settle, and cultivate. The promise was a reality, but the *experience* of it depended on their action.
        -   [EGW]: "[EGW] Having a knowledge of Canaan, singing the songs of Canaan, rejoicing in the prospect of entering into Canaan, did not bring the children of Israel into the vineyards and olive-groves of the promised land. They could make it theirs in truth only by occupation, by complying with the conditions, by exercising living faith in God, by appropriating his promises to themselves." (YI, Feb. 17, 1898).
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "What is the spiritual danger of being content with 'knowing about' the promises of salvation (like peace, joy, victory over sin) without actively 'possessing' them in our daily experience?"

#### B. The New Testament Parallel: "Work Out" Your Salvation (9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Philippians 2:12-13
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the New Testament version of Joshua 13:1. Paul is not saying "work *for*" your salvation, but "work *out*" what God has already worked *in*.
        -   [WB]: Equation: God works IN -> We work OUT
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the essence of sanctification. God gives us the gift of a new heart and the indwelling Spirit (He works in). Our part is to cooperate with that Spirit, to choose to obey, to fight the battles against temptation, to actively cultivate the fruits of the Spirit (we work out). This is not legalism; it is a partnership. The Canaanites represent our hereditary and cultivated tendencies to sin which must be conquered.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A general can guarantee victory and provide air support, intelligence, and superior weapons. But the individual soldier must still get in the trench, aim his weapon, and fight the enemy in front of him. He fights *because* of the general's power, not to earn it. We fight sin in the strength of Christ's guaranteed victory.
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 6:12
        -   Reading/Challenge: The writer of Hebrews urges us to be imitators of those who inherit the promises. How?
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The two required actions on our part are **faith** and **patience**. Faith to believe God's promise when we see enemies in the land. Patience to persevere in the fight when victory is not instantaneous. These are character qualities essential for the last days.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Philippians 2:13 says God is working in us. What is one specific 'Canaanite'—a habit, an attitude, a besetting sin—that you know God is asking you to partner with Him to 'work out' and 'possess' victory over this week?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that God, in His infinite grace, gives us the promise of salvation as a free gift, just as He gave Canaan to Israel. But the Bible is equally clear that the blessing and experience of that salvation must be **possessed** through an active, obedient faith that partners with His power.
-   Character Focus Recap: This process of possessing our inheritance *is* the process of character perfection. By driving out the "Canaanites" of sin, we are being made ready for the ultimate inheritance.
    -   [WB]: `VICTORY` / `HOLINESS`
-   Call to Action/Decision: The question for us today is the same as for Joshua: "There remaineth yet very much land to be possessed." Are you content to live on the borders of the promised land, just singing the songs of Canaan? Or will you, by faith in the Captain of our salvation, rise up and possess the victory over sin and the peace He has promised?
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: ```"POSSESS THE LAND" (Joshua 1:11)```
    -   *(Final Question):* Based on God's Word today, what is one area of your "promised land" that you will intentionally begin to occupy this week, trusting in His power?
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The patriarchs never fully received the promise in their lifetime. They were looking for something better. "But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city" (Hebrews 11:16). Let us press forward, possessing His character now, in preparation for that eternal home.
    -   [WB]: Hope phrase: ```"A BETTER COUNTRY" - Hebrews 11:16```
