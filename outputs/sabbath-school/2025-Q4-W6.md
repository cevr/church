# 2025 Q4 W6 - November 1-7
## The Enemy Within

**Overarching Theme:** Corporate Holiness: The Anatomy of Sin and the Prerequisite for Victory
**Central Focus:** Understanding from the sanctuary of Scripture that individual sin has corporate consequences, and that God requires a pure and sanctified people to accomplish His work and prepare for His return.
**Key Texts:** Joshua 7:1, 11-13; Jeremiah 17:9-10; Joshua 8:1-2

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Have you ever been part of a team—in sports, at work, or in a project—where the entire effort failed because one person secretly failed to do their part? That feeling of collective failure because of an individual weakness is a small picture of a profound spiritual principle.
-   Theme Introduction: Today's study, "The Enemy Within," goes beyond a mere historical account. We will explore the profound biblical theme of **Corporate Holiness**. We often focus on our individual walk, which is vital, but Scripture teaches that our private choices have public consequences for the body of Christ.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Corporate Holiness: The Enemy Within"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: As we stand on the borders of the heavenly Canaan, the most dangerous foe is not the culture around us, but the unconsecrated attitudes within the camp—within our own hearts. God is preparing a people who can stand in His holy presence, and this requires a deep work of purification.
-   Roadmap: We will journey through Joshua chapter 7 to dissect the anatomy of sin and its devastating impact. Then, we will see in God's response the divine pattern for purification, restoration, and ultimate victory.

### II. The Anatomy of Defeat: Sin in the Camp (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** After the stunning victory at Jericho, Israel faces a humiliating defeat at Ai. Why? The Bible is explicit. Let's examine God's diagnosis to understand how one person's hidden sin paralyzes the entire body of believers.

#### A. The Ripple Effect of a Single Sin (7 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 7:1
        -   Reading/Context: "But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan... took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the Lord was kindled against the children of Israel."
        -   [WB]: Achan's Sin -> God's Anger -> Against ISRAEL. (Use arrows)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Notice the inspired language. One man, Achan, acted. But God says, "**Israel** committed a trespass." The guilt was corporate. This is the biblical principle of our interconnectedness. We are not spiritual islands; we are a body, and what one part does affects the whole.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a single weak link in a massive anchor chain holding a ship in a storm. The strength of the entire chain is determined by its weakest point. In the same way, unconfessed sin in the church weakens the entire body's hold on God's power.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In verse 1, who physically took the items? But who does God hold responsible? What does this immediately teach us about our connection to one another in the church?"

#### B. God's Divine Diagnosis of Sin (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 2 & 3:** Joshua 7:11-12
        -   Reading/Context: "Israel hath **sinned**, and they have also **transgressed** my covenant... for they have even **taken** of the accursed thing, and have also **stolen**, and **dissembled** also, and they have **put it** even among their own stuff. Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies..."
        -   [WB]: Write the downward spiral: Sinned -> Transgressed -> Taken -> Stolen -> Deceived -> Hidden
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God doesn't just see an action; He sees the layers of rebellion. It was a violation of a sacred covenant, theft directly from God, outright deception, and a profane attempt to mix the unholy with the holy. The result was a complete withdrawal of Divine power. God cannot, and will not, partner with sin.
        -   [EGW]: "Because of this one man's sin, the presence of the Lord was withdrawn from the armies of Israel. The Lord would not serve with their sins." (3T 264).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think God used six distinct descriptions for what Achan did? What does this reveal about how seriously God views what we might call 'one little compromise'?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4 & 5:** Joshua 7:21 & Jeremiah 17:9-10
        -   Reading/Connection: Achan confesses the process: "When I **saw**... I **coveted** them, and **took** them; and, behold, they are **hid**..." This perfectly mirrors what Jeremiah says about the heart being deceitful, but that God searches it.
        -   [WB]: Diagram the process: EYES (See) -> HEART (Covet) -> HANDS (Take) -> EARTH (Hide).
        -   Practical Step: The battle is always won or lost in the heart. Covetousness is the root. This is why God's primary work is character transformation. He is more concerned with who we are becoming than what we are doing. Our actions are merely the fruit of our heart's condition.
        -   [EGW]: "The deadly sin that led to Achan's ruin had its root in covetousness, of all sins one of the most common and the most lightly regarded..." (PP 496).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Achan's fall began with seeing and coveting. In our modern world, what are some of the 'beautiful Babylonian garments' that tempt our hearts and challenge our undivided loyalty to God?"

### III. The Path to Restoration: Purifying the Camp (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** God does not leave His people in defeat. His justice is always redemptive. The process He institutes is not merely to punish, but to purify, restore, and make victory possible once again. This is our great hope.

#### A. Sanctification: The Prerequisite for Power (7 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 7:13
        -   Reading/Challenge: "Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves... for thus saith the Lord God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you."
        -   [WB]: Step 1: SANCTIFY -> Step 2: VICTORY
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Notice the sequence. God doesn't say "fight harder." He says "get holy." Sanctification is not an optional extra for the super-spiritual; it is the absolute, non-negotiable condition for God's presence and power to work in and through His people.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* A surgeon cannot perform a life-saving operation in a contaminated room. Before healing can begin, the environment must be sterilized. God, the Divine Surgeon, requires a sanctified church—a clean heart—before He can work His miracles of grace.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "The command was to 'sanctify the people,' not just 'find the sinner.' What is the difference in that focus, and why is that shift in perspective so important for the church today?"

#### B. Confession as an Act of Worship (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 7:19
        -   Reading/Context: Joshua's pastoral plea: "My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto him..."
        -   [WB]: True Confession -> GLORY TO GOD
        -   Deeper Insight: How does confessing sin give God glory? It vindicates His character. It declares: God, You are **omniscient** (You saw what I did in secret). You are **just** (Your law, which I broke, is good). And You are **holy** (My sin is an offense against Your pure character). It is an act of aligning ourselves with God's view of reality.
        -   [EGW]: "Then, when his sin could no longer be concealed, he admitted the truth... There was no genuine repentance for sin, no contrition, no change of purpose, no abhorrence of evil." (PP 497-498).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Sister White draws a sharp line between admitting facts when caught and true repentance. In our own prayer life, how can we move beyond merely admitting faults to a genuine confession that gives God glory and shows an 'abhorrence of evil'?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3 & 4:** Joshua 8:1 & Hosea 2:15
        -   Reading/Promise: Immediately after the purification, God says, "Fear not... I have given into thy hand the king of Ai..." Centuries later, the prophet Hosea looks back and says God will make "the valley of Achor [trouble] for a door of hope."
        -   [WB]: Valley of Achor (Trouble) => A Door of Hope
        -   Practical Step: Once sin is faced and forsaken according to God's direction, His presence and promises are immediately restored. The very place of our deepest shame and failure—our "Valley of Trouble"—becomes the gateway to renewed hope and victory. God specializes in turning our greatest defeats into opportunities for His grace.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection/Hope):* "Can you think of a time when dealing honestly with a painful issue—a 'Valley of Achor'—though difficult, ultimately opened a 'door of hope' and new spiritual victory in your life?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen in God's Word that hidden sin, rooted in the heart, paralyzes the church. We learned that God requires holiness, not for arbitrary reasons, but because it is the very condition of His presence and power.
-   Character Focus Recap: God is not looking for a perfect church, but a purified one. A people willing to be sanctified. This process of dealing with "the enemy within" is the essence of our preparation for Christ's soon return.
    -   [WB]: `HOLINESS` (Ex. 28:36)
-   Call to Action/Decision: The call today is not to look around the camp for Achan, but to look within our own hearts and ask the Holy Spirit to do His divine investigation. Let us personally respond to Joshua's plea and give glory to God through honest confession and a willingness to forsake any "accursed thing."
    -   [WB]: `“Search me, O God”` (Ps. 139:23)
    -   *(Final Question):* Based on God's Word today, what is one area where you will personally invite God's searching and sanctifying power this week?
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The story of Achan is a solemn warning, but the story of Ai's eventual defeat is a glorious promise. Our God is able to take our places of trouble and transform them into doors of hope. As we, His people, surrender fully to His purifying work, He will lead us from victory to victory, until we enter the heavenly Canaan.
    -   [WB]: Final phrase: `"The Valley of Trouble... A Door of Hope"`
