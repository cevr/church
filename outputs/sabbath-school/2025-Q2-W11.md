## Ruth and Esther: Loyalty, Redemption, and Courage for the End Time

**Overarching Theme:** The Great Controversy Unveiled: Loyalty, Redemption, and End-Time Courage
**Central Focus:** Developing unwavering loyalty to God (like Ruth/Mordecai) and courageous faith (like Esther) through Christ our Redeemer (like Boaz), preparing us for the final conflict.
**Key Texts:** Ruth 1:16-17; Ruth 4:9-10; Esther 3:2-5; Esther 4:14, 16; Revelation 12:17

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "Can ancient stories, thousands of years old, hold the keys to navigating the final moments of earth's history?" Today we see how Ruth and Esther do exactly that.
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: The Great Controversy isn't just a doctrine; it's played out in real lives. We'll explore unwavering Loyalty, Christ's Redemption, and the divine Courage needed, especially now.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Loyalty, Redemption, Courage)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: These aren't just stories; they reveal the character God is perfecting in His people to stand loyal in the face of the final test, ready for eternity.
-   Roadmap: We'll see Ruth's choice of loyalty, understand Christ as our true Kinsman Redeemer through Boaz, and draw courage from Esther's stand against evil.

### II. The Unwavering Choice of Loyalty (Ruth) (10 mins)
-   **A. Leaving Moab Behind:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: True loyalty to God often requires a decisive break from our past allegiances and comforts (symbolized by Moab) to fully embrace God's people and His ways, even amidst loss and uncertainty.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ruth 1:14-17 - Contrast Orpah's return with Ruth's resolute commitment: "Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God." This wasn't mere sentiment; it was a covenantal pledge.
    -   EGW Insight: Boaz, whom Ruth later met, "represented the character of the Christian gentleman... He showed courtesy to all..." (HM, Dec 1, 1894, par. 1). Ruth chose a people led by such principles, reflecting God's own character.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: We face subtle (and sometimes not-so-subtle) pressures to compromise, to return to the 'Moab' of worldly ways or lukewarm faith. Ruth challenges us to make a complete commitment.

-   **B. Loyalty Tested by Hardship:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Ruth's loyalty wasn't formed in ease but proven through famine, bereavement, and poverty. Our commitment deepens when we remain faithful through trials, not just in blessings.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ruth 1:1-5, 20-21 - Naomi felt "the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me," yet Ruth clung to her and her God. Loyalty shines brightest against a dark backdrop.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Discouragement, bitterness, and focusing on loss can erode our loyalty. Ruth shows us steadfastness rooted in faith, not circumstance.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Like a soldier swearing allegiance, Ruth transferred her loyalty fully, burning the bridges back to Moab. There was no Plan B.
-   *Hypothetical:* Imagine someone choosing to move to a difficult, poor country to care for a loved one, leaving behind wealth and ease. That captures some of Ruth's sacrifice.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* LOYALTY
-   *Diagram:* Arrow: Moab -> Bethlehem (World -> God's People)
-   *Verse:* Ruth 1:16 ("Your people... your God")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...decisive break..."

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "What specific phrases in Ruth 1:16-17 show the depth of Ruth's commitment?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it sometimes harder to be loyal to God and His people during difficult times than during good times?"
-   *(Application):* "What 'Moab' (a habit, association, or comfort) might God be asking you to leave behind for a deeper walk with Him?"

### III. Our Kinsman Redeemer: From Poverty to Royalty (Boaz/Christ) (10 mins)
-   **A. The Hope of Redemption:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The Old Testament law of the *Goel* (Kinsman Redeemer) beautifully typifies Jesus Christ, who became our relative (human) to legally buy back our lost inheritance (eternal life) and take us (sinful humanity) as His cherished bride.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ruth 2:20 (Naomi recognizes Boaz as a redeemer); Ruth 4:1-10 (Boaz fulfills the legal requirements); Leviticus 25:25, 47-49 (Basis of the law). Boaz paid the price Ruth and Naomi couldn't.
    -   EGW Insight: "So the work of redeeming us and our inheritance, lost through sin, fell upon Him who is ‘near of kin’ unto us. It was to redeem us that He became our kinsman... Closer than father, mother, brother, friend, or lover is the Lord our Saviour." (DA 327.2).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: We are spiritually bankrupt due to sin, unable to save ourselves. Christ's redemption is our only hope, freely offered.

-   **B. Satan's Claim Overruled:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Just as there was a nearer kinsman who *couldn't* or *wouldn't* redeem Ruth (Ruth 4:6), Satan, the usurper, has laid claim to humanity through sin. Christ, our true Redeemer, definitively refutes Satan's claim by paying the infinite price.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Job 1:6-11; Jude 1:9; Matt 4:8-9 - Satan claims ownership and allegiance. Christ's victory secures our release.
    -   EGW Insight: Satan claimed even Moses due to sin, disputing his resurrection, but Christ, the Prince of Life, overruled him (PP 478.2). Christ's power is greater than the enemy's claim.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Feeling unworthy or still bound by past sins. We must grasp that Christ's payment *fully* covers our debt and secures our position in Him.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Imagine being hopelessly indebted, facing prison. Suddenly, a wealthy relative you barely knew steps in, pays everything, adopts you, and makes you an heir. That's a glimpse of what Christ did.
-   *Metaphor:* Satan is like a predatory lender holding a fraudulent title deed to humanity. Christ, the rightful owner and our brother, exposed the fraud and paid the true price to reclaim us.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* REDEMPTION / KINSMAN REDEEMER
-   *Diagram:* Cross -> Broken Chains (Debt Paid)
-   *Verse:* Eph 1:7 / Ruth 4:10
-   *Quote Snippet:* "He became our kinsman" (DA 327)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What were the two main things the Kinsman Redeemer did according to the law? (Redeem land, redeem person/marry widow)"
-   *(Reflection):* "How does understanding Christ as our *Kinsman* Redeemer, one who became like us, deepen the meaning of His sacrifice?"
-   *(Application):* "If Christ has fully redeemed us, how should that change the way we view our past mistakes or feelings of unworthiness?"

### IV. Courage for "Such a Time as This" (Esther/Mordecai) (10-12 mins) [*]
-   **A. Uncompromising Faithfulness:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Like Mordecai refusing to bow to Haman, God's faithful people in the last days will refuse to compromise His law or give homage to human authority that usurps God's place, even under threat.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Esther 3:1-5 (Mordecai's refusal); Daniel 3 (Hebrew Worthies); Rev 13:15 (Forced worship). Mordecai's stand wasn't about personal pride, but divine honor.
    -   EGW Insight: "Today the enemies of the true church see in the little company keeping the Sabbath commandment, a Mordecai at the gate. The reverence of God’s people for His law is a constant rebuke to those who have cast off the fear of the Lord and are trampling on His Sabbath." (PK 605.3).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Develops integrity, faithfulness to principle over popularity or safety.

-   **B. Courage Born of Providence and Prayer:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Esther's courage to face the king wasn't presumption; it was born from recognizing God's providential placing ("for such a time as this") and fueled by earnest prayer, fasting, and a willingness to risk everything ("If I perish, I perish").
    -   Biblical Foundation: Esther 4:13-16 (Mordecai's challenge, Esther's resolve and call to fast); Esther 5:1-3 (Approaching the king).
    -   EGW Insight: "The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick, earnest action; but both she and Mordecai realized that unless God should work mightily in their behalf, their own efforts would be unavailing. So Esther took time for communion with God, the source of her strength." (PK 601.2). See also DG 45.1.
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: The final crisis will demand similar courage, grounded not in self, but in faith in God's power and purpose, sought through prayer.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Like a firefighter running *into* the burning building when everyone else runs out, Esther moved toward danger, trusting in a higher call.
-   *Hypothetical Example:* Standing alone for Bible truth in a workplace or family setting where everyone else disagrees or mocks. It takes courage derived from conviction and prayer.

-   *Verse:* Esther 4:14, 16 / Rev 12:17
-   *Quote Snippet:* "If I perish, I perish." / "...a Mordecai at the gate." (PK 605)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "What steps did Esther take *before* going to the king?" (Called for fasting/prayer).
-   *(Reflection):* "Mordecai told Esther perhaps she came to the kingdom 'for such a time as this.' How might that apply to us living in these last days?"
-   *(Application):* "What specific fear related to standing for God's truth might you need to surrender to Him in prayer, asking for Esther-like courage?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Ruth shows us **unwavering loyalty**, leaving all for God. Boaz reveals **Christ our Redeemer**, paying our debt. Esther and Mordecai model **uncompromising courage** for the final test.
-   Character Focus Recap: God is calling us to develop this same loyalty, grasp this full redemption, and pray for this divine courage. These aren't optional extras; they are essential for the remnant.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Traits: LOYALTY, FAITH, COURAGE)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Will you choose today, like Ruth, to be fully loyal? Will you rest fully, like Ruth with Boaz, in the redemption Christ offers? Will you pray, like Esther, for courage to stand faithfully "for such a time as this"?
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action: CHOOSE LOYALTY / REST IN REDEMPTION / PRAY FOR COURAGE)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What one step toward greater loyalty or courage will you ask God to help you take this week?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The final conflict is coming. "Satan will arouse indignation against the minority who refuse to accept popular customs..." But fear not! "Now, as in the days of Esther and Mordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and His people." (PK 605.4, 606.1). Trust your Kinsman Redeemer!
    -   *(Whiteboard: Final Phrase: "He Will Vindicate His People!" (PK 606))*
