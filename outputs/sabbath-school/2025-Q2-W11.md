**Overarching Theme:** Divine Intervention and Human Cooperation in the Great Controversy
**Central Focus:** Recognizing God's sovereign hand in redemption and deliverance, and understanding our vital role in cooperating with Him through faithful character and courageous action, especially in preparation for the final crisis.
**Key Texts:** Ruth 2:12, Ruth 4:9-10, Esther 4:14, Revelation 12:17

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Have you ever felt caught in circumstances beyond your control, wondering where God is? The stories of Ruth and Esther speak directly to those moments, revealing a God who is actively working behind the scenes, even in famine and crisis.
-   Theme Introduction: Today, we explore the **profound** biblical theme of **Divine Intervention and Human Cooperation**. God has a plan for redemption and deliverance, but He calls us to partner with Him. Understanding this scriptural truth is **CRITICAL** for navigating life and preparing for eternity.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Divine Intervention & Human Cooperation"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Both Ruth and Esther demonstrate characters forged in trial – loyalty, courage, selflessness. These are the very traits God seeks to perfect in His people today as we prepare for Christ's soon return. Our cooperation involves character development.
-   Roadmap: We'll first see God's initiative in personal restoration through Ruth, then witness courageous cooperation leading to corporate deliverance in Esther, and finally, consider our own role in these last days.

### II. The Kinsman Redeemer: God's Initiative in Personal Restoration (Ruth) (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Let's turn to Ruth. Her story begins in hardship – famine, loss, displacement (Ruth 1:1-5) – mirroring humanity's state after Eden. But God hadn't forgotten them.

#### A. Faithfulness Amidst Loss ({Est. 5 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Ruth 1:16
        -   Reading/Context: Naomi urges Ruth to return to Moab, but Ruth makes a profound commitment. Read verse.
        -   [WB]: Ruth 1:16 / "Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This isn't just loyalty to Naomi, but a conversion – a choice to align with God's people and God Himself, despite the bleak outlook. This reflects the **surrender** required in aligning our will with God's.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What specific commitments does Ruth make in this verse? What does this reveal about her character?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Ruth 2:11-12
        -   Reading/Connection: Ruth acts on her commitment, humbly gleaning. Boaz recognizes her character and speaks a blessing. Read verses.
        -   [WB]: Ruth 2:12 / "Under whose wings you have come for refuge."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Boaz highlights Ruth's **faith** (leaving homeland) and **action** (seeking refuge under God's wings). God notices and rewards faithfulness, even in seemingly small acts. This requires trust and humility.
        -   [EGW]: Boaz represented the character of the Christian gentleman... He showed courtesy to all his servants... Christians should be the most courteous people in the world. `[EGW]` -"Respond to Divine Love,” HM Dec 1, 1894, par. 1.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does Boaz's recognition and blessing affirm Ruth's decision in chapter 1? How does God show us refuge today?"

#### B. Redemption Planned and Secured ({Est. 10 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Ruth 3:11
        -   Reading/Context: Ruth, following Naomi's counsel (based on God's law), appeals to Boaz as kinsman redeemer. Boaz affirms her character. Read verse.
        -   [WB]: Ruth 3:11 / "Woman of noble character" (Virtuous Woman)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Ruth's reputation preceded her. Her consistent faithfulness built a character recognized by the community. This "noble character" is what God desires to build in us – the result of cooperating with Him daily.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Ruth 4:9-10
        -   Reading/Connection: Boaz publicly fulfills the role of kinsman redeemer, purchasing the land and taking Ruth as wife. Read verses.
        -   [WB]: Ruth 4:9-10 / Redeemer -> Buys Back Inheritance & Bride
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The kinsman redeemer (Goel) had to be related, willing, and able to pay the price. This beautifully types Christ, our **true** Kinsman Redeemer.
        -   [EGW]: "So the work of redeeming us and our inheritance, lost through sin, fell upon Him who is 'near of kin' unto us. It was to redeem us that He became our kinsman... Closer than father, mother, brother, friend, or lover is the Lord our Saviour." `[EGW]` (DA 327).
        -   [WB]: {Short Quote Snippet: "...became our kinsman..."}
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "Thinking of Christ as our Kinsman Redeemer, what 'price' did He pay, and what 'inheritance' does He restore to us?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine finding a lost family heirloom in a pawn shop. You joyfully pay the price to buy it back because it belongs to your family; it's precious to you. Christ saw us lost in sin and paid the ultimate price to redeem us back to His family.
        -   Connecting to Life: God takes the initiative through Christ. Our cooperation is accepting His redemption and living as His restored children, developing that "noble character."
    -   **Foundation Text 5 (Outcome):** Ruth 4:13-17
        -   Reading/Challenge: God blesses the union; lineage leads to David, and ultimately Christ. From emptiness to fullness, from barrenness to legacy.
        -   [WB]: Emptiness -> Fullness / Restoration
        -   Practical Step: Ruth's story shows personal restoration is possible through faith and cooperation with God's plan. It requires trusting His providence even when we can't see the end.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Like Ruth, we face losses and uncertainties. How can her example of faithfulness, even before she saw the outcome, encourage us in our walk with God this week?"

### III. Courage in Crisis: Cooperating with God for Corporate Deliverance (Esther) (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Now we shift to Esther. Here, the threat isn't just personal hardship but potential genocide – a direct attack on God's people, prefiguring the final attack on the remnant.

#### A. The Enemy's Plot and the Call to Action ({Est. 7 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Esther 3:5-6, 13
        -   Reading/Context: Haman, filled with pride and rage because Mordecai won't bow (an act of worship reserved for God), plots to destroy all Jews. A death decree is issued.
        -   [WB]: Esther 3:5-6 / Pride -> Wrath -> Death Decree (Cf. Rev 13)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This mirrors Satan's rage against those loyal to God. Haman demands worship/homage; Mordecai's faithfulness to God alone provokes attack. This is a Great Controversy principle.
        -   [EGW]: "The decree which is to go forth against the people of God in the near future is in some respects similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews... Satan instigated this scheme in order to rid the earth of those who preserved a knowledge of the true God." `[EGW]` (ST Nov 8, 1899, par. 9).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Connection):* "What motivated Haman's decree? How does Mordecai's refusal to compromise foreshadow challenges God's people might face?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Esther 4:13-14
        -   Reading/Connection: Mordecai challenges Esther: Don't think your position guarantees safety. Perhaps you are here **for such a time as this**.
        -   [WB]: Esther 4:14 / "For such a time as this" -> Divine Purpose
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God positions His people strategically. Our circumstances, talents, and positions are not accidental. He calls for **courageous cooperation** at critical moments. Silence or inaction is not an option when truth and God's people are threatened. This requires recognizing God's providence and acting in faith.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What does 'for such a time as this' imply about God's foresight and our responsibility? Have you ever felt God placed you somewhere for a specific purpose?"

#### B. Dependence, Courage, and Divine Favor ({Est. 8 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Esther 4:15-16
        -   Reading/Context: Esther accepts the challenge, but not in her own strength. She calls for fasting and prayer. "If I perish, I perish."
        -   [WB]: Fasting & Prayer -> Dependence on God / "If I perish..." -> Surrender
        -   Unpacking the Truth: True courage is not recklessness. It is action rooted in **total dependence** on God. Esther understood the battle was spiritual. Her surrender ("If I perish") shows her priorities – faithfulness over self-preservation. This is the character needed to face the final crisis.
        -   [EGW]: "The crisis that Esther faced demanded quick, earnest action; but both she and Mordecai realized that unless God should work mightily in their behalf, their own efforts would be unavailing. So Esther took time for communion with God, the source of her strength." `[EGW]` (PK 601).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "When facing difficult decisions or challenges to our faith, how can Esther's approach (prayer, fasting, seeking God first) guide us?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Esther 5:1-3
        -   Reading/Connection: After seeking God, Esther acts. She approaches the king unsummoned, risking death, but finds favor.
        -   [WB]: Risk -> Action -> Divine Favor (Golden Scepter)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God honors courageous faith rooted in dependence. He opens doors, grants favor, and works providentially when His people step out in obedience. This doesn't mean the absence of fear, but acting despite it, trusting God.
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine being asked to speak up for something right, even if it means potential backlash at work or in your community. It feels like approaching the king uninvited. Esther shows us that after seeking God, we must step forward, trusting Him to extend the 'golden scepter' of His providence and protection.
        -   Connecting to Life: God calls us to be His witnesses, sometimes in difficult or 'risky' situations. Our cooperation involves stepping out in faith, relying on His strength.
    -   **Foundation Text 5 (Outcome & Parallel):** Esther 8:15-17 & Revelation 12:17
        -   Reading/Challenge: Deliverance comes, sorrow turns to joy, and God's people are vindicated. Compare this to the end-time remnant who face the dragon's wrath but remain faithful. Read verses.
        -   [WB]: Deliverance! / Rev 12:17 - Remnant Keep Commandments & Testimony
        -   Practical Step: Esther's story is a microcosm of the final deliverance promised to God's faithful remnant who keep His commandments and have the testimony of Jesus, even under threat. Our cooperation now builds the character needed then.
        -   [DQ]: *(Synthesis):* "How do the stories of Ruth and Esther together illustrate both God's personal care (Redeemer) and His ultimate victory for His people (Deliverer) in the Great Controversy?" [*]

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen God's **sovereign initiative** in redemption (Ruth/Boaz/Christ) and His call for our **courageous cooperation** in times of crisis (Esther/Mordecai/Remnant). He works providentially, even through hardship, to restore and deliver.
-   Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** call is high: loyalty like Ruth, integrity like Boaz, courage like Esther, faithfulness like Mordecai. These aren't optional; they are the character traits forged by **cooperating** with God through trials, essential for standing in the last days.
    -   [WB]: Key Traits: `FAITHFULNESS`, `COURAGE`, `DEPENDENCE`
-   Call to Action/Decision: Are we cooperating with God's plan for our lives? Are we allowing Him to build His character in us? Are we ready to stand "for such a time as this"? Let us commit to deeper **dependence** and bolder **faithfulness**.
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: ```"COOPERATE"``` / ```"STAND"```
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Based on God's Word today, what one step of faithful cooperation is God calling you to take this week?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The final conflict is coming, paralleling Esther's day. But the God who delivered then promises deliverance again. Let us trust our Kinsman Redeemer and King.
    -   [EGW]: "Today, as in the days of Esther and Mordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and His people." `[EGW]` (PK 606, adapted from ARSH Jan 23, 1908).
    -   [WB]: Final Hope: ```"GOD WILL VINDICATE"``` (PK 606)
