**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Why have human attempts at government, even with good intentions, so often failed throughout history? What does this tell us about a deeper, spiritual conflict?
-   Theme Introduction: Today we explore a profound biblical theme: **Allegiance in the Great Controversy**. It's the choice between God's loving rule and humanity's persistent desire for self-rule, a choice that shapes history and, more importantly, our eternal destiny.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Allegiance: God's Rule or Self-Rule?"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding this conflict is **CRITICAL** because our response determines our character. Are we being molded into the image of Christ, fit for His eternal kingdom, or are we reflecting the spirit of rebellion? God's purpose is restoration – His image in us.
-   Roadmap: We'll examine the roots of rebellion (Nimrod, Israel's choice), God's intended plan (Abraham, Christ's teaching), and the urgent call for allegiance today.

### II. The Counterfeit Kingdom: Rebellion and Self-Exaltation (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Let's trace the pattern of rebellion against God's authority, starting near the beginning. This spirit is foundational to the counterfeit kingdoms of this world.

#### A. The Spirit of Babel: Defiance and Self-Sufficiency (Est. 8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 10:8-10 (Nimrod)
        -   Reading/Context: Briefly read about Nimrod, "mighty hunter **before** [in defiance of] the LORD," founder of Babel/Babylon.
        -   [WB]: Gen 10:9 "mighty one... before the LORD" (defiance)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Nimrod represents human power and ambition set up in opposition to God. He sought greatness on earth through his own strength, establishing centers of organized rebellion.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What does the phrase 'mighty hunter before the LORD' suggest about Nimrod's attitude towards God?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Genesis 11:4 (Tower of Babel)
        -   Reading/Connection: Read the ambition: "let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose top is in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves..." This is the spirit of Nimrod's kingdom materialized.
        -   [WB]: Gen 11:4 "Make a name for OURSELVES" -> Self-Exaltation
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This wasn't just architecture; it was a declaration of independence from God, seeking unity and security through human effort and pride, not divine guidance. The character flaw is **pride** and **self-reliance** over **trust** in God.
        -   [EGW]: "Rebellion originated with Satan, and all rebellion against God is directly due to satanic influence. Those who set themselves against the government of God have entered into an alliance with the archapostate..." `[EGW]` (PP 635).
        -   [WB]: Pride -> Rebellion -> Alliance with Enemy
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How might the spirit of 'making a name for ourselves' manifest subtly in our own lives or even in the church today?"

#### B. Rejecting the Divine King: Israel's Choice (Est. 7 mins) [*]
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** 1 Samuel 8:4-7 (Israel demands a king)
        -   Reading/Context: The elders demand a king "like all the nations," explicitly rejecting God's direct rule through Samuel.
        -   [WB]: 1 Sam 8:5 "King like all the nations"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: They desired conformity to the world's political structures, valuing earthly power and visibility over the unique privilege of being under God's direct reign. God's assessment: "they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them." (v. 7)
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "Why was wanting a king 'like all the nations' considered a rejection of God Himself?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** 1 Samuel 8:18 (The Predicted Consequence)
        -   Reading/Connection: Samuel warns them of the oppressive nature of human kings, concluding: "And you will cry out in that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, and the LORD will not hear you in that day."
        -   [WB]: 1 Sam 8:18 -> Consequences of Rejecting God's Rule
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Choosing human systems over God's way inevitably leads to disappointment and hardship. It highlights the need for **faith** to trust God's unseen governance over visible, worldly power.
        -   [EGW]: "When men choose to have their own way, without seeking counsel from God, or in opposition to His revealed will, He often grants their desires, in order that, through the bitter experience that follows, they may be led to realize their folly and to repent of their sin... That which the heart desires contrary to the will of God will in the end be found a curse rather than a blessing." `[EGW]` (PP 605).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a child insisting on riding their bike without training wheels before they're ready, despite the parent's warnings. They want independence "like the bigger kids," but the result is often a painful fall. Israel wanted to be "like the nations" and fell hard.
        -   Connecting to Life: We face similar temptations to rely on worldly methods, status, or power instead of trusting God's ways, often leading to spiritual "falls."
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Reflecting on the illustration and Israel's choice, where might we be tempted to trust 'worldly kings' (methods, status, power) instead of God's direct leading in our lives?"

### III. God's Kingdom Blueprint: Separation, Service, and Submission (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** In contrast to rebellion, God calls His people to a different way – a kingdom built on His principles, designed to bless the world and restore His image in us.

#### A. Called to Be Separate and Bless (Est. 8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 12:1-3 (Abraham's Call)
        -   Reading/Context: God calls Abram out: "Get out of your country... to a land that I will show you... and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
        -   [WB]: Gen 12:1-3: SEPARATION -> BLESSING
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's plan begins with **separation** from worldly influences (Babel's spirit) to establish a people who live by **faith** and **obedience**, becoming a channel of God's blessing to the world. This requires trusting God's unseen plan over familiar comforts.
        -   [EGW]: "In order that God might qualify him for his great work as the keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be separated from the associations of his early life... God has spoken, and His servant must obey; the happiest place on earth for him was the place where God would have him to be." `[EGW]` (PP 126).
        -   [WB]: Obedience based on FAITH, not sight.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What does 'separation' from the world mean for us practically today, without isolating ourselves from those we are called to bless?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Deuteronomy 4:6-8 (Israel's Intended Witness)
        -   Reading/Connection: Moses reminds Israel that obeying God's wise statutes would make them a unique witness to surrounding nations, demonstrating God's nearness and righteousness.
        -   [WB]: Deut 4:6: Obedience -> Wisdom -> Witness
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God's law wasn't burdensome; it was the blueprint for a society reflecting His character – justice, wisdom, compassion. Living this out was their mission. This requires **diligence** in obedience and **intentionality** in reflecting God's character.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How can our personal or collective obedience to God's principles today serve as a 'witness' to those around us, drawing them to inquire about our God?"

#### B. The Kingdom Principle: Greatness Through Service (Est. 7 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Matthew 20:25-28 (Christ's Teaching on Leadership)
        -   Reading/Context: Jesus directly contrasts worldly ("Gentile") leadership based on authority and power with His kingdom's principle: greatness through service and humility.
        -   [WB]: Matt 20:26-28: World = Lordship | Christ = Service
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The kingdom of God operates on **opposite** principles to the kingdoms of this world (Nimrod, Babel, worldly kings). True greatness is found not in ruling over others, but in serving them, following Christ's example. This requires a radical transformation of our natural desire for status and control.
        -   [EGW]: "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles. He called men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear the infirmities of the weak. Power, position, talent, education, placed their possessor under the greater obligation to serve his fellows." `[EGW]` (DA 550).
        -   [WB]: Kingdom Principle: Service & Humility
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a hospital. Who is truly "greatest" – the administrator with the biggest office, or the skilled surgeon saving lives, or the compassionate nurse tending to the suffering? In God's eyes, greatness is measured by selfless service, not position.
        -   Connecting to Life: This principle challenges our worldly definitions of success and calls us to evaluate our motives. Are we seeking to serve or to be served?
        -   [DQ]: *(Personal Application):* "Considering Jesus' words and the hospital illustration, what is one specific way you can practice 'greatness through service' in your family, church, or community this week?"

### IV. The Final Call: Allegiance Amidst Confusion (5-8 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** As we near the end, the conflict between God's kingdom and worldly systems intensifies. God sends a final, urgent call for allegiance.

#### A. Discerning and Departing from Babylon (Est. 5 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Revelation 14:6-7 (First Angel's Message)
        -   Reading/Context: The everlasting gospel goes forth, calling all to "Fear God and give glory to Him... and worship Him who made heaven and earth..."
        -   [WB]: Rev 14:7: Fear God -> Give Glory -> Worship Creator
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the foundational call to **true allegiance**, redirecting worship from self or worldly systems back to the Creator God. It's the antidote to the spirit of Babel.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Revelation 18:1-4 (Call Out of Babylon)
        -   Reading/Connection: A mighty angel illuminates the earth, declaring Babylon's fall (representing confused, apostate religious/political systems mingled with the world) and issuing the urgent plea: "**Come out of her, my people**, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues."
        -   [WB]: Rev 18:4: "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This requires **spiritual discernment** to recognize "Babylon" – systems and attitudes (pride, compromise, seeking worldly power) that oppose God's truth, even within professed Christianity. It demands **courage** to stand apart and maintain pure allegiance to God and His Word.
        -   [EGW]: "'The mystery of iniquity' carried forward its deceptive... work. Almost imperceptibly the customs of heathenism found their way into the Christian church... Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her spirit controlled the church." `[EGW]` (GC 49-50). This highlights the subtle danger of compromise.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection/Discernment):* "Without judging individuals, what are some 'Babylonian' attitudes or practices (like pride, compromise with the world, seeking power over service) we need to personally 'come out of'?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine being in a large, confusing marketplace filled with loud vendors shouting conflicting directions and selling wares that look appealing but are ultimately harmful or fake. Suddenly, a clear, authoritative voice calls out from one direction, urging you to leave the chaos and follow towards safety and truth. Hearing and heeding that call requires tuning out the noise and trusting the one true voice. That's like the call to come out of spiritual Babylon today.
        -   Connecting to Life: We must actively listen for God's voice through His Word amidst the confusing messages of the world and even compromised religion, and have the courage to follow Him alone.

#### B. The Everlasting Kingdom Assured (Est. 3 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Daniel 7:14 (Memory Text Revisit)
        -   Reading/Context: Re-read the promise: To Christ is given an **everlasting dominion** that **will not pass away**, a kingdom that **shall not be destroyed**.
        -   [WB]: Dan 7:14: EVERLASTING KINGDOM!
        -   Unpacking the Truth & Hope: Despite the rise and fall of human kingdoms and the prevalence of rebellion, God's ultimate victory is **certain**. His kingdom, based on righteousness and love, will prevail. Our allegiance now prepares us to be citizens of that eternal kingdom.
        -   [DQ]: *(Hope/Assurance):* "How does the certainty of God's everlasting kingdom (Dan 7:14) give us strength and hope to remain faithful amidst the confusion and pressures of this world?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've traced the stark contrast in Scripture: the path of self-exaltation and rebellion (Nimrod, Babel, Israel's choice) versus God's call to separation, submission, and service (Abraham, Christ's teaching). The choice of allegiance defines our path.
-   Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** call is clear: we need characters transformed by God's Spirit – marked by **humility, faith, obedience, and service** – rejecting the pride and self-sufficiency of the world, to be ready for His coming.
    -   [WB]: Character Needed: `HUMILITY` / `FAITHFULNESS` / `SERVICE`
-   Call to Action/Decision: Which kingdom principles govern your heart? Choose this day whom you will serve. Will you consciously submit every area of your life to Christ's rule, rejecting the spirit of Babylon?
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: ```CHOOSE GOD'S RULE``` / ```"COME OUT"``` (Rev 18:4)
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Based on God's Word today, what one aspect of 'self-rule' will you surrender to Christ's authority this week, asking for His transforming power?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The conflict is real, the times are urgent. But the victory is assured! Let us heed the call, separate from the world's spirit, and prepare our characters through His grace for the glorious, everlasting kingdom.
    -   [EGW]: "We need constantly a fresh revelation of Christ, a daily experience that harmonizes with His teachings... Every day we may advance in perfection of Christian character." `[EGW]` (GW 274).
    -   [WB]: Final Hope: ```"HIS KINGDOM SHALL NOT BE DESTROYED"``` (Dan 7:14)
