# 2025 Q2 W4 - April 19-25
## The Nations: Part 1 - God's Kingdom vs. Human Dominion

**Overarching Theme:** The Eternal Choice: God's Kingdom Principles vs. Worldly Dominion
**Central Focus:** Cultivating a character submitted to God's rightful rule, reflecting His kingdom principles (service, humility, obedience) and rejecting the spirit of self-exaltation inherent in worldly power structures, thus preparing for Christ's eternal kingdom.
**Key Texts:** Genesis 12:1-3; 1 Samuel 8:7, 18-19; Matthew 20:25-28; Daniel 7:14; Revelation 18:1-4

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Ask: "Who should be in charge? It's a question humanity has wrestled with since Eden. What happens when we choose the wrong answer?"
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: The Great Controversy isn't just cosmic; it's fought over who governs our hearts and societies – God's loving authority or human/satanic principles of dominion. Understanding this choice is **critical** for us today.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Kingdom vs. Human Dominion)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This choice directly shapes our character – humility vs. pride, service vs. lordship. Our daily choices in this controversy determine our readiness for Christ's soon return and His eternal kingdom.
-   Roadmap: We'll explore (1) The root of human self-rule, (2) God's intended alternative, (3) The danger of compromise, and (4) The final call to choose God's kingdom.

### II. The Genesis of Human Dominion: Choosing Self Over God (8-10 mins)
-   **A. Rebellion's Blueprint (Nimrod & Babel):**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Early human history (Gen 10-11) reveals a pattern: rejecting God's authority leads to attempts at self-glorifying unity and control, defying God's plan. Nimrod ("mighty hunter *before* [in defiance of] the Lord") embodies this spirit.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 10:8-10; Gen 11:4 ("let us make a name for ourselves"). This is the foundation of Babylon – organized human effort centered on self, not God.
    -   EGW Insight: "Rebellion originated with Satan, and all rebellion against God is directly due to satanic influence. Those who set themselves against the government of God have entered into an alliance with the archapostate..." (PP 635).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The innate human desire for control and recognition apart from God is the root of worldly systems and personal sin.

-   **B. Israel Demands a King: Rejecting God's Direct Rule:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Israel's demand for a human king (1 Sam 8) wasn't just a political preference; it was a **rejection** of God as their immediate King, desiring to be "like all the nations."
    -   Biblical Foundation: 1 Sam 8:7 ("...they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them."); 1 Sam 8:18 (Warning of consequences).
    -   EGW Insight: "When men choose to have their own way, without seeking counsel from God, or in opposition to His revealed will, He often grants their desires, in order that, through the bitter experience that follows, they may be led to realize their folly and to repent..." (PP 605).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: The temptation to rely on visible, human structures and leaders instead of trusting God's unseen guidance is ever-present.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Building a house. Are we building on the Rock (God's authority) or shifting sand (human ideas, self-will)? The storms of life reveal the foundation.
-   *Hypothetical:* Imagine needing directions in a dangerous land. Would you trust the mapmaker (God) or someone who just *claims* to know the way but ignores the map (human wisdom)?

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* REBELLION / SELF-RULE
-   *Diagram:* Two Paths: Arrow Up (God's Rule) vs. Arrow Circle (Self/Human Rule)
-   *Verse:* 1 Sam 8:7 ("...they have rejected Me...")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...alliance with the archapostate." (PP 635)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In 1 Samuel 8, what reason did the elders give for wanting a king?" (To be like other nations, judge us, fight our battles).
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is the desire to be 'like everyone else' or to rely on human power so strong, even when we know God's way is best?"
-   *(Application):* "What's one area in our personal lives where we might be tempted to 'appoint a king' (rely on self/world) instead of fully trusting God's reign?"

### III. God's Kingdom Alternative: A People Set Apart (8-10 mins)
-   **A. Abraham's Call: A Counter-Cultural Movement:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's response to Babel wasn't forced conformity, but calling out one man, Abraham, to start a people **separated** from worldly ways, living under God's direct blessing and guidance.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 12:1-3 ("Get out of your country... I will make you a great nation... in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."). This was God's plan to reach the world *through* a distinct people.
    -   EGW Insight: "In order that God might qualify him for his great work as the keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be separated from the associations of his early life... His character must be peculiar, differing from all the world." (PP 126).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Requires **faith** to step away from the familiar and **obedience** to follow God into the unknown, trusting His promises.

-   **B. Israel as a Light: Demonstrating God's Governance:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: God intended Israel to be a living demonstration to the nations of the blessings and wisdom of living under His laws and direct rule (a theocracy). Their distinctiveness was meant to attract, not repel.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Deut 4:6-8 ("Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people... What great nation is there that has God so near... statutes and judgments so righteous?").
    -   EGW Insight: "He desired them to be as wells of salvation to the world... They were to reveal God to men." (DA 27-28). Sadly, "the Israelites fixed their hopes upon worldly greatness... they departed from the commandments of God, and followed the ways of the heathen." (DA 28).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: God still calls a people today to be distinct, demonstrating His character and kingdom principles to a world lost in 'Babylonian' confusion.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* An ambassador represents their home kingdom in a foreign land. They live differently, speak differently, operate by different rules, showcasing their king's character. We are ambassadors for Christ's kingdom.
-   *Metaphor:* God wanted Israel to be a pure wellspring, offering living water to thirsty nations. Instead, they often became a broken cistern, mixing God's truth with pagan ways (Jer 2:13).

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* SEPARATION / WITNESS
-   *Diagram:* Light shining from one point (God's people) outwards to darkness (World).
-   *Verse:* Gen 12:2-3 / Deut 4:6
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...character must be peculiar..." (PP 126)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Deuteronomy 4, what was supposed to make Israel look 'wise and understanding' to other nations?" (Keeping God's righteous statutes).
-   *(Reflection):* "What does it mean for God's people today to be 'separated' or 'peculiar' without being isolated or irrelevant?"
-   *(Application):* "What is one practical way our church community, or we as individuals, can better 'reveal God' (be a light) to our neighbors and colleagues this week?"

### IV. The Kingdom Clash: Service vs. Lordship (7-9 mins) [*]
-   **A. Christ's Kingdom Principles:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Jesus explicitly contrasted the world's model of leadership (dominion, authority over others) with His kingdom's model: **servant leadership** and humility.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Matt 20:25-28 ("...rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them... Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant... just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve...").
    -   EGW Insight: "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles. He called men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear the infirmities of the weak." (DA 550).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The temptation to seek position, power, and recognition, even within the church, mirrors the world's system and opposes Christ's.

-   **B. The Danger of Compromise: Church History's Warning:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: When the church seeks worldly power and compromises with pagan/secular principles (like Israel wanting a king), it loses its spiritual power and distinctiveness, becoming corrupted (spiritual Babylon).
    -   Biblical Foundation: 2 Cor 6:14-18 (Call to separation); Rev 2:12-17 (Pergamos compromise). History shows this pattern (Constantine).
    -   EGW Insight: "...as persecution ceased, and Christianity entered the courts and palaces of kings, she laid aside the humble simplicity of Christ... Paganism, while appearing to be vanquished, became the conqueror. Her spirit controlled the church." (GC 49-50).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Subtle pressures to conform, adopt worldly methods for "success," and prioritize institutional power over faithful witness are constant dangers.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Metaphor:* Leaven in dough. A little compromise (leaven) can seem harmless, but it eventually permeates and changes the whole character of the loaf (the church or individual).
-   *Analogy:* Two different blueprints for building. One is God's plan (service, humility, faithfulness). The other is the world's (power, status, results at any cost). We can't build God's house using the world's blueprint.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* SERVICE vs DOMINION / COMPROMISE
-   *Diagram:* Cross (Service/Humility) vs. Pyramid (Worldly Power Structure)
-   *Verse:* Matt 20:26 ("...it shall not be so among you...")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...laid aside humble simplicity..." (GC 49-50)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Matthew 20, what did Jesus say is the path to greatness in His kingdom?" (Being a servant and slave to all).
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is the model of 'lording it over' others so common in the world, and why is it sometimes tempting even for Christians?"
-   *(Application):* "How can we actively practice 'servant leadership' in our homes, workplaces, or church roles, resisting the urge to seek status or control?"

### V. The Final Call: Allegiance in the Last Days (7-9 mins)
-   **A. Babylon's Fall and God's Glory:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Prophecy foretells the ultimate failure and judgment of all human systems built on rebellion (symbolized by Babylon). Simultaneously, God's character (His glory) will be fully revealed through His faithful people.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 18:1-2 ("...Babylon the great is fallen... I saw another angel... having great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his glory.").
    -   EGW Insight: "We need constantly a fresh revelation of Christ, a daily experience that harmonizes with His teachings... Every day we may advance in perfection of Christian character." (GW 274). This character reflects His glory.
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Requires **faithfulness** amidst widespread apostasy and **diligence** in seeking a deeper connection with Christ to reflect His character fully.

-   **B. The Call to Come Out:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's final message includes an urgent call for His people still entangled in the *spirit* and *systems* of worldly compromise (Babylon) to separate themselves completely and align fully with His kingdom principles.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 18:4 ("And I heard another voice from heaven saying, 'Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.'").
    -   EGW Insight: "Often the words well prepared and studied have but little influence. But the true, honest expression of a son or daughter of God, spoken in natural simplicity, has power to unbolt the door to hearts..." (COL 232). Our distinct, Christ-like lives are the most powerful call.
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: This isn't just about church membership; it's about ensuring our hearts, priorities, and lifestyles are free from the pride, materialism, and self-reliance that define Babylon.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Metaphor:* A lighthouse on a stormy coast. It doesn't blend in; its distinct light warns ships away from the dangerous rocks (Babylon's ways) and guides them to safe harbor (God's kingdom).
-   *Analogy:* Sorting wheat from tares at harvest. In the end times, there will be a clear distinction between those fully loyal to God's kingdom and those aligned with the world.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* BABYLON / COME OUT / GLORY
-   *Diagram:* Arrow pointing OUT of a circle labeled "Babylon" towards a Cross/Crown.
-   *Verse:* Rev 18:4 ("Come out of her, my people...")
-   *Question:* Allegiance? (God or World?)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What is the command given to 'My people' in Revelation 18:4?" (Come out of Babylon).
-   *(Reflection):* "Thinking spiritually, what are some characteristics or attitudes of 'Babylon' that we need to be careful to 'come out of' personally?"
-   *(Application):* "How does striving for 'perfection of Christian character,' as mentioned by EGW (GW 274), help us answer the call to come out of Babylon and reflect God's glory?"

### VI. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: We've seen the age-long conflict: humanity's drive for self-rule (Babylon) versus God's call to live under His loving kingdom principles (service, humility, obedience). Israel faltered, the church has often compromised, but God's plan prevails.
-   Character Focus Recap: The ultimate question is one of allegiance, reflected in our character. Are we building His kingdom within us, becoming like Christ? This is the **essential preparation** for His return.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: HUMILITY / FAITHFULNESS)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Choose daily, consciously, to reject the spirit of worldly dominion in your thoughts, attitudes, and actions. Submit fully to Christ's reign in your heart.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SUBMIT / SERVE)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What one specific step will you take this week to more fully live under God's kingdom principles, rather than the world's?" (Lead into prayer)
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The choice is stark, the time is short. But the promise is sure: Christ *will* establish His everlasting kingdom. Let us be found ready, reflecting His character. "Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom... His dominion is an everlasting dominion..." (Dan 7:14).
    -   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Dan 7:14 / "His Kingdom Comes!")*
