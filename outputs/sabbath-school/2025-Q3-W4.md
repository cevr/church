# 2025 Q3 W4 - July 19-25
## The Plagues

**Overarching Theme:** The Unveiling of Divine Sovereignty and the Fixing of Human Character
**Central Focus:** To understand the plagues not merely as punishments, but as God's systematic revelation of His supreme authority over all creation and false worship, and to see in Pharaoh's response a solemn case study of how character is hardened and destiny is sealed by the rejection of divine light.
**Key Texts:** Exodus 5:2; Exodus 8:19; Exodus 9:16

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: We often read the story of the plagues and are troubled by the phrase, "the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart." It can sound unjust, as if God forced a man to be lost. But is that what the Bible is teaching? Today, we will look deeply into the scriptures to see that this story is one of the most profound lessons on God's justice, His mercy, and the terrifying power of human choice in the great controversy.
-   Theme Introduction: The core theme today is the **Unveiling of Divine Sovereignty and the Fixing of Human Character**. This isn't just a story about ancient Egypt; it's a divine lesson plan showing how God reveals Himself and how our response to that revelation shapes us for eternity.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "God's Sovereignty & Man's Choice"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: The battle in Egypt was a battle for the mind and will of Pharaoh, the Egyptians, and even Israel. It demonstrates a universal principle: how we respond to God's truth today determines whether our hearts become tender toward Him or hardened in rebellion, fitting us either for heaven or for destruction. Our character is being fixed by similar choices every day.
-   Roadmap: We will first explore how God established His authority over all false gods. Then, we will examine the biblical process of a heart becoming hardened, to draw vital lessons for our own spiritual readiness.

### II. The Battle of Sovereigns: Jehovah vs. The gods of Egypt (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** The conflict didn't begin with plagues, but with a foundational question of authority. Pharaoh asked the question that the entire conflict would answer.

#### A. The Foundational Challenge and Divine Response (8-10 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 5:2 - "And Pharaoh said, **Who is the LORD**, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go."
        -   Reading/Context: This is the opening challenge. Pharaoh, considered a god himself, dismisses the God of a slave people. The ten plagues are God's direct, powerful, and patient answer to this one question.
        -   [WB]: "Who is the LORD?" (Ex. 5:2)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Pharaoh's question wasn't one of genuine inquiry; it was a statement of defiance based on ignorance and pride. He ruled a land of thousands of gods. In his mind, Jehovah was just another tribal deity, and a weak one at that.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "What does Pharaoh's question in Exodus 5:2 reveal about his worldview and his character from the very beginning?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 7:10-13 - "And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh... and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh... and it became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers... they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but **Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods**."
        -   Reading/Connection: God's first response isn't overwhelming force, but a sign-miracle that directly confronts the symbol of Pharaoh's own divine power—the serpent (the goddess Wadjet).
        -   [WB]: Diagram: Aaron's Serpent -> eats -> Magicians' Serpents
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Satan, through the magicians, produces a counterfeit. This is a key tactic in the great controversy. But God doesn't just match the counterfeit; He demonstrates its powerlessness. The truth of God **consumes and nullifies** the deceptions of the enemy. The character need is for discernment between the true and the false.
        -   [EGW]: "The difference between the work of God and that of the magicians was, one was of God, the other of Satan. One was true, the other false." (SG3 206).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do you think God allowed the magicians to replicate the miracle at first, instead of just preventing it? What does this teach us about how God deals with deception?"

#### B. The Verdict of the Enemy and the Purpose of God (7-8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 8:18-19 - "And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not... Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, **This is the finger of God**: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened..."
        -   Reading/Context: After two successful counterfeits, the enemy's power reaches its limit. The plague of lice, creating life from dust, is something only the Creator can do.
        -   [WB]: Quote: "This is the finger of God" (Ex. 8:19)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Even the enemies of God are forced to recognize a power beyond their own. This was a testimony *against* Pharaoh from his own trusted advisors. He now had evidence from both God's prophet and his own experts, yet he refused.
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a city powered by a single, massive hydroelectric dam. A fraudulent electrician comes to town, using small generators to power a few lights, claiming he is the source of all power. The true master engineer doesn't argue; he simply shuts off the water to the fraudulent generators (lice) and then begins systematically turning off sections of the city's grid (plagues on livestock, sun, etc.), proving who truly controls the power. God was showing He controlled the entire "grid" of Egyptian life.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Numbers 33:4 - "For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had smitten among them: **upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments**."
        -   Reading/Challenge: This is the Bible's own summary of the plagues. It wasn't just about punishing people; it was a legal verdict executed against the false claims of idolatry. Each plague targeted a specific domain of an Egyptian god—the Nile, the sun, the livestock, life itself.
        -   [WB]: GOD'S JUDGMENT -> upon Egypt's gods
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The plagues exposed the powerlessness of Egypt's idols. What are some modern 'gods'—like money, technology, science, or self-reliance—that people trust in, and how does God sometimes allow trials in our lives to show us their insufficiency?"

### III. The Anatomy of a Hardened Heart: Divine Light and Human Defiance (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Now we come to the central question. How does a heart get "hardened"? The Bible shows it's not a single act by God, but a process driven by human choice in response to God's light.

#### A. The Sowing and Reaping of Stubbornness [*] (8-9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 8:15 - "But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, **he hardened his heart**, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said." (See also 8:32, 9:34)
        -   Reading/Context: Notice the agent in the early plagues. The Bible is explicit: Pharaoh hardens his *own* heart. This happens repeatedly.
        -   [WB]: Phase 1: "Pharaoh hardened his heart"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The hardening was an active choice. It happened when the pressure was *off*. In the midst of the crisis, he was willing to bargain; once relief came, his pride and rebellion returned. This is a critical spiritual diagnostic.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why is it often easier to promise obedience to God in a crisis than to remain faithful when things are going well? What does this text teach us about the nature of true conversion?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 9:12 - "And **the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh**, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses."
        -   Reading/Connection: Now, after Pharaoh has repeatedly and willfully hardened his own heart, the language shifts. What has changed?
        -   [WB]: Phase 2: "The LORD hardened his heart"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is not God infusing evil into Pharaoh. This is a judicial act. God honors Pharaoh's repeated choices by withdrawing His restraining Spirit and giving him over to the path he has stubbornly chosen. The light God sends to soften now has the opposite effect on a heart that has chosen rebellion.
        -   [EGW]: "God gave to Pharaoh the most striking evidence of divine power, but the monarch stubbornly refused to heed the light. Every display of infinite power rejected by him, rendered him the more determined in his rebellion. The seeds of rebellion that he sowed when he rejected the first miracle, produced their harvest." (PP 268).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a wound. If you gently apply medicine, it can heal. But if you keep picking at it, irritating it, and refusing the medicine, the body's response is to form hard, thick, unfeeling scar tissue. Pharaoh kept irritating his conscience against the healing balm of God's truth, and his heart became spiritually calloused and unresponsive.
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "Considering the 'scar tissue' illustration and the EGW quote, how would you explain the difference between 'Pharaoh hardened his heart' and 'the Lord hardened his heart' to someone?"

#### B. The Divine Purpose in Human Rebellion (7-8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 9:16 - "And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, **for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth**."
        -   Reading/Context: God reveals His ultimate purpose. Even in the face of Pharaoh's rebellion, God's plan is not thwarted. He will use Pharaoh's defiance to create an unshakable testimony of His power and name.
        -   [WB]: Purpose: "That My Name may be declared" (Ex. 9:16)
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Romans 1:28 - "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, **God gave them over** to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;"
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul explains this principle of judicial hardening. It begins with a human choice ("did not like to retain God"), and the divine consequence is being "given over" to the natural results of that choice. This is exactly what happened to Pharaoh.
        -   Practical Step: Pharaoh's story is a warning against trifling with the convictions of the Holy Spirit. When God speaks to our heart about a sin to forsake, a duty to perform, or a truth to accept, our immediate response is critical. To delay or refuse is to sow a seed of hardness. The call is for **immediate, willing surrender** to revealed light.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Pharaoh's story is an extreme example, but we can see the principle on a smaller scale. Can you think of a time when ignoring a small conviction from God made it easier to ignore the next one? How do we keep our hearts soft and responsive?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from the scriptures that the plagues were God's definitive answer to the question, "Who is the LORD?" He is the Sovereign Creator, and all other powers are nothing before Him. We have also seen that a hardened heart is not the result of an arbitrary act of God, but the tragic, self-inflicted consequence of persistently rejecting His light and mercy.
-   Character Focus Recap: Pharaoh's character was fixed in rebellion. God is calling us to have our characters fixed in righteousness, which can only happen through moment-by-moment surrender to His will. The same divine power displayed in Egypt is available to us today for victory over sin.
    -   [WB]: Key Character Trait: `A TENDER HEART` / `SURRENDER`
-   Call to Action/Decision: The story of Pharaoh demands a response. Will we be like the clay that hardens under the sun of God's truth, or like the butter that melts? The choice is ours, and we make it with every small decision to obey or to delay.
    -   [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: ```"HEAR HIS VOICE"``` (Heb. 3:15)
    -   *(Final Question):* "As we close, let's reflect personally. Is there any area where you feel your heart becoming calloused or resistant to God's voice? Let us ask Him right now for the grace to surrender that one thing."
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Pharaoh's story ends in tragedy, but ours does not have to. The same God who executed judgment on Egypt is rich in mercy to all who call upon Him. His desire is not to harden, but to save. Let us heed the warning and embrace the promise.
    -   [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: ```"A new heart also will I give you" (Ezek. 36:26)```
