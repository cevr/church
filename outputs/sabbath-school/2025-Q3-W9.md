# 2025 Q3 W9 - August 23-29
## Living the Law

**Overarching Theme:** The Law as a Revelation of God's Character and a Blueprint for Our Restoration
**Central Focus:** To move beyond a superficial understanding of God's law to see its principles as the very transcript of His character of love and justice, and to understand that our sanctification is the process of having this character restored in us by Christ.
**Key Texts:** Exodus 23:20-22, Matthew 5:43-45, Matthew 5:48

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Ask the class: "If you wanted to understand the true character of a king you'd never met, where would you look?" (Allow answers like 'his servants,' 'his family'). "One of the best places would be his laws. A nation's laws reveal the heart of its ruler." Today, we're going to look at God's laws to understand His heart.
-   Theme Introduction: Our lesson is called "Living the Law," but we're going to go deeper. We will explore how God's law, from the ancient rules in Exodus to the teachings of Christ, is not just a list of rules but a perfect **revelation of His character**.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: **LAW = A REVELATION OF CHARACTER**
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding this is critical. God's purpose in salvation is to restore His character—His moral image—in us. This is what it means to be sanctified and made ready for heaven. The law is our divine blueprint for this restoration.
-   Roadmap: We will first look at the "Covenant Code" in Exodus to see God's character of justice and mercy. Then, we'll see how Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount, magnifies these principles, calling us to a perfection of character that reflects our Heavenly Father.

### II. God's Character Revealed in the Covenant Code (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** After the Ten Commandments, God gave Israel specific civil laws. To our modern ears, some sound strange. But let's look past the surface and see the divine principles of a loving and just God trying to elevate a broken people.

#### A. Principles of Justice and Mercy ({Est. 9 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 22:21-23 - "You shall neither mistreat a stranger nor oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child. If you afflict them in any way, and they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry."
        -   Reading/Context: This comes right after laws about theft and restitution. God immediately turns His attention to the most vulnerable.
        -   [WB]: `PROTECT THE VULNERABLE` (Stranger, Widow, Orphan)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is a radical concept in the ancient world. A nation's greatness was measured by its power, not its compassion. God establishes a different standard: a society is judged by how it treats its weakest members. This reveals His own tender, protective heart.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "What does God's personal promise, 'I will surely hear their cry,' tell us about His relationship with the oppressed and suffering?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 23:4-5 - "If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again. If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying under its burden... you shall surely help him with it."
        -   Reading/Connection: This goes beyond simple justice. This is proactive, difficult love. It's not just "don't harm your enemy," but "actively help your enemy."
        -   [WB]: `LOVE YOUR ENEMY` (Ancient Israel Edition)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Our natural human tendency is to rejoice when our enemy suffers a loss. God is teaching a heavenly principle: His love and care extend even to those who hate us, and our character must be transformed to do the same.
        -   [EGW]: "The minds of the people, blinded and debased by slavery and heathenism, were not prepared to appreciate fully the far-reaching principles of God's ten precepts. That the obligations of the Decalogue might be more fully understood and enforced, additional precepts were given, illustrating and applying the principles of the Ten Commandments." (PP 310.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Considering the [EGW] quote, how do these specific laws about helping an enemy's donkey begin to retrain a 'debased' mind toward God's way of thinking?"

#### B. The Divine Presence Enabling Obedience [*] ({Est. 7 mins})
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of these laws like guardrails on a treacherous mountain pass. They aren't there to ruin your fun or limit your freedom. They are placed there by someone who knows the road and the dangers, to keep you from falling off the cliff. They are an expression of care.
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 23:20-22 - "Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. Beware of Him and obey His voice... for My name is in Him. But if you indeed obey His voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries."
        -   Reading/Challenge: This is the ultimate promise. The Lawgiver doesn't just give the law and leave. He sends His own presence—Christ, the Angel of the Covenant—to empower and guide them.
        -   [WB]: `THE ANGEL (CHRIST)` -> `POWER TO OBEY`
        -   Practical Step: God never gives a command without providing the power to obey it. The struggle to live out His law is not meant to be a solo effort. The central question is, are we walking in awareness of the Angel's presence, listening for His voice? Obedience flows from relationship with Him.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "The illustration called the law a 'guardrail.' How does knowing that Christ Himself is the one guiding us along this road change our perspective on obedience to difficult commands?"

### III. Christ Restores the Spirit of the Law (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Centuries later, the people had turned God's "guardrails" of love into a fence of burdensome rules. They kept the letter but had lost the heart. Jesus came to restore the original meaning and show that the law is about heart transformation, not just external actions.

#### A. From Retaliation to Restoration ({Est. 8 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Matthew 5:38-39 - "You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also."
        -   Reading/Context: The original law (Ex. 21:24) was a principle of public justice to *limit* vengeance, not a license for personal revenge. The Pharisees had twisted it.
        -   [WB]: `LETTER: "Eye for Eye"` vs. `SPIRIT: "Turn the other cheek"`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Jesus is restoring the spirit of the law. He's saying the goal was never equal retaliation; it was always about stopping the cycle of violence and demonstrating a higher, redemptive character. He calls us to absorb injustice rather than reflect it, showing the character of God who "is kind to the unthankful and evil" (Luke 6:35).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why is our natural human reaction to 'get even' so strong? What does yielding this 'right' to God do to our own character?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Romans 12:19 - "Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, 'Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,' says the Lord."
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul explains the principle behind Jesus' teaching. We can afford to be merciful because we trust in a just God. Justice will be done, but by Him, in His time and His way. Our job is to reflect His mercy.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* We are called to be thermostats, not thermometers. A thermometer simply reflects the temperature of the room—if it's angry, it reflects anger. A thermostat *sets* the temperature. In a "room" of hatred or injustice, we are called by Christ to set the temperature to love and grace.

#### B. The Call to Perfect Restoration ({Est. 8 mins})
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Matthew 5:44-45 - "But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you... that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good..."
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the positive command that fulfills the principle from Exodus 23. It's the ultimate expression of God's character. We prove our spiritual parentage by reflecting our Father's character.
        -   [WB]: `Love Enemies` -> `Proof of Sonship`
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What is one specific, practical way to 'do good' to someone who has wronged us this week, reflecting the Father's character?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Matthew 5:48 - "Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect."
        -   Reading/Challenge: This is the climax of the chapter. After describing the character of a citizen of heaven, Jesus gives this seemingly impossible command.
        -   Deeper Insight: The word "perfect" here means complete, mature, whole. It's a call to a character that is fully developed in love and mercy, not marred by selfishness or retaliation. It is the complete restoration of the image of God in the soul.
        -   [EGW]: "Jesus said, Be perfect as your Father is perfect. If you are the children of God you are partakers of His nature, and you cannot but be like Him... That life in you will produce the same character and manifest the same works as it did in Him. Thus you will be in harmony with every precept of His law..." (MB 77.1).
        -   [WB]: `PERFECT = MATURITY IN LOVE`

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that God's law is not an arbitrary set of rules. It is a beautiful portrait of His own character of justice, mercy, and redemptive love. From the rules for an ancient society to the teachings of Christ, the goal has always been the same.
-   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Having seen that the law is a picture of God's heart, how does this change your personal view of the Ten Commandments or other biblical rules?"
-   Character Focus Recap: The high calling of the gospel is not just to be forgiven, but to be **transformed**. The biblical call to be "perfect" is a call to have the Father's character of unselfish love fully restored in us through the indwelling life of Christ.
    -   [WB]: `HOLINESS = REFLECTING HIS CHARACTER`
-   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of our lives as mirrors. A perfect, clean mirror doesn't have an opinion; it simply reflects the image before it. Our calling is to reflect the character of Christ to the world. But when we hold onto bitterness, or insist on our "right" to get even, it's like allowing cracks and dirt to cover the mirror. The image of Christ becomes distorted or obscured. Sanctification is the daily process of allowing God to clean the mirror.
-   Call to Action/Decision: The world operates on retaliation and self-interest. Heaven operates on mercy and self-sacrificing love. We must choose which kingdom's principles we will live by. This week, let's consciously surrender our "right" to be offended, our "right" to get even.
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: `CHOOSE MERCY`
-   [DQ]: *(Self-examination):* "Using the illustration of the mirror, what 'cracks' or 'dirt'—like resentment, impatience, or a desire for payback—does the Holy Spirit reveal in our lives that distort our reflection of Christ?"
-   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Based on God's Word today, what is one relationship or situation where you will ask God for the grace to be a 'thermostat' of His love, rather than a 'thermometer' of the world's anger?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: This transformation is the work of a lifetime, but it is the most urgent work, for only those who have cooperated with Christ in this restoration of His character will be able to stand in the day of God. Let us find our hope not in our own strength, but in His promise.
    -   [EGW]: "The Lord permits conflicts, to prepare the soul for peace. The time of trouble is a fearful ordeal for God's people; but it is the time for every true believer to look up, and by faith he may see the bow of promise encircling him." (GC 633.2).
    -   [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS"` (Heb. 12:2)
