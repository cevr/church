**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Think about the most intimate, committed human relationship possible – a
  faithful marriage. God uses this very picture to help us grasp the depth of
  His desire for connection with us. But it's more than just a nice feeling;
  it's a **sacred covenant** with eternal implications.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we explore this profound biblical theme: The Sacred
  Covenant between Christ and His people, symbolized by marriage. Understanding
  this **scriptural depth** is crucial for navigating our lives and preparing
  for eternity.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Sacred Covenant: Faithful Unto the End"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about
  **character transformation**. God's purpose in this covenant is to restore His
  image in us, making us faithful, holy, and ready for the ultimate
  "wedding"—the Marriage Supper of the Lamb (Rev 19:9). Our faithfulness
  reflects His character in the Great Controversy.
- Roadmap: We'll examine God's covenant ideal from Scripture, confront the
  painful reality of our potential unfaithfulness, and embrace God's power for
  restoration and readiness.

### II. God's Covenant Ideal: The Divine Husband's Love & Purpose (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Let's first establish from God's Word the
  incredible foundation of this relationship – God's initiating, sacrificial,
  and purifying love.

#### A. The Foundation: Created for Oneness ({Est. 4 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 2:24 - "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become **one flesh**."
        -   Reading/Context: Right at creation, God established the ideal – intimate, exclusive union.
        -   [WB]: Gen 2:24 -> "One Flesh" Ideal
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This "one flesh" points beyond the physical; it signifies a deep unity of heart, mind, and purpose, reflecting the unity God desires with us.
        -   [EGW]: "God celebrated the first marriage... When the divine principles are recognized and obeyed in this relation, marriage is a blessing; it guards the purity and happiness of the race, it provides for man's social needs, it elevates the physical, the intellectual, and the moral nature." (PP 46).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What does the 'one flesh' principle in Genesis suggest about the *kind* of relationship God intended from the beginning?"

#### B. The Purpose: A Sanctified Bride ({Est. 6-8 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Ephesians 5:25-27 - "Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and **gave Himself for her**, that He might **sanctify and cleanse her** with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a **glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle** or any such thing, but that she should be **holy and without blemish**."
        -   Reading/Connection: Paul elevates the Genesis ideal, showing Christ as the ultimate Husband. His love isn't passive; it's sacrificial and has a specific goal.
        -   [WB]: Eph 5:25-27 -> Gave Himself -> Sanctify/Cleanse -> Holy/Blameless Bride
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Christ's love isn't just to make us feel good; it's **transformative**. He died to make us **holy**. This directly confronts our natural state of sinfulness ("spots and wrinkles"). The goal is character perfection, reflecting His own purity.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "According to Ephesians 5, what is the *ultimate purpose* of Christ's sacrificial love for His church (His bride)?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Ezekiel 16:8-14 - (Summarize/Read key phrases) God finds Israel abandoned, enters into covenant ("swore an oath... entered into a covenant... you became Mine"), clothes her, adorns her, makes her beautiful with **His splendor**.
        -   Reading/Context: A powerful picture of God's initiating grace. Israel had nothing to offer.
        -   [WB]: Ezek 16:8-14 -> Covenant -> God's Splendor -> Bride's Beauty (Gift)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Our standing, our "beauty" before God, is entirely His gift, His righteousness bestowed upon us through the covenant. We contribute nothing initially but our need.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine finding a destitute orphan, cleaning them up, clothing them in royal robes, and declaring them your own beloved child. That's a glimpse of what God does for us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How does remembering that our spiritual 'beauty' is a gift from God (Ezek 16) help us guard against spiritual pride, as the lesson asks?"

### III. The Bride's Struggle: Infidelity and the Call to Faithfulness (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The biblical narrative is painfully honest.
  Despite God's incredible love and purpose, His bride often struggles with
  faithfulness. This spiritual infidelity, called "harlotry" or "adultery" in
  Scripture, is a serious danger we must recognize in ourselves.

#### A. The Tragic Turn: Trusting in Self ({Est. 5-6 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Ezekiel 16:15 - "But you **trusted in your own beauty**, played the harlot because of your fame, and poured out your harlotry on everyone passing by who would have it."
        -   Reading/Context: The immediate, tragic turn after God's lavish gifts. The bride forgot the source of her beauty.
        -   [WB]: Ezek 16:15 -> Trusted Own Beauty -> Harlotry (Infidelity)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Spiritual infidelity often begins with self-reliance and pride, forgetting that all we have is from God. This leads to seeking fulfillment or validation elsewhere – in the world, in false teachings, in self-serving pursuits.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What does 'trusting in your own beauty' look like in a spiritual sense today? What are modern forms of spiritual 'harlotry' or divided affections?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Hosea 1:2 - "Go, take yourself a wife of harlotry and children of harlotry, for the land has committed **great harlotry by departing from the Lord**."
        -   Reading/Connection: God uses Hosea's painful life to illustrate the deep hurt caused by Israel's unfaithfulness. It wasn't just minor mistakes; it was a fundamental departure.
        -   [WB]: Hosea 1:2 -> Departing from the LORD = Harlotry
        -   [EGW]: "Here is shown the Lord's reluctance to give up His sinning people... God does not delight in afflicting His people; but with a care that surpasses that of a pitying father for a wayward child, He entreats His wandering people to return to their allegiance." (4T 176).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Considering Hosea's painful experience and [EGW]'s comment, how should the reality of spiritual infidelity affect our relationship with God and our choices?"

#### B. The End-Time Warning: Babylon's Seduction [*] ({Est. 5-6 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Revelation 17:1-2 - Describes "the great harlot who sits on many waters, with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication."
        -   Reading/Context: This imagery isn't just historical; it has critical end-time significance. Babylon represents a worldwide system of false worship and compromise that seduces people away from true faithfulness to God.
        -   [WB]: Rev 17:1-2 -> Babylon = Great Harlot -> Global Deception
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 18:3-4 - "For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication... **Come out of her, my people**, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues."
        -   Reading/Challenge: This is God's urgent call to His *own people* who may be entangled in Babylon's compromises – false doctrines, worldly alliances, prioritizing comfort over truth.
        -   [WB]: Rev 18:4 -> "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE!"
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like being married but constantly flirting with someone else, adopting their values, spending your time and affection on them. God calls us to break off these dangerous spiritual liaisons.
        -   [DQ]: *(Personal Application):* "What subtle influences or compromises ('Babylon') might be drawing our affections away from complete faithfulness to Christ today? How do we heed the call to 'come out'?"

### IV. Restoration and Readiness: Preparing for the Marriage Supper (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Despite our failings, the story doesn't end in
  judgment for those who respond. God's covenant love persists, offering
  restoration and calling us to prepare for the glorious consummation – the
  Marriage Supper of the Lamb.

#### A. God's Persistent, Restoring Love ({Est. 5-6 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Hosea 2:14, 19-20 - "Therefore, behold, I will **allure her**, Will bring her into the wilderness, And speak comfort to her... I will **betroth you to Me forever**; Yes, I will betroth you to Me In righteousness and justice, In lovingkindness and mercy; I will betroth you to Me in **faithfulness**, And you shall know the Lord."
        -   Reading/Context: Astonishing grace! After exposing the harlotry, God Himself initiates reconciliation, promising a renewed, faithful covenant relationship.
        -   [WB]: Hosea 2:14, 19-20 -> Allure -> Betroth Forever -> In Faithfulness
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God doesn't just forgive; He actively works to win back our hearts and restore the relationship on the foundation of His righteousness and faithfulness. Our hope lies in His initiative.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What does God's promise to 'allure' and 'betroth' His unfaithful people again reveal about His character and His ultimate desire for us?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Peter 1:18-19 - "...knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold... but with the **precious blood of Christ**, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the price God paid to make restoration possible. He bought us back from our spiritual adultery.
        -   [WB]: 1 Peter 1:18-19 -> Redeemed by Precious Blood
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like Hosea buying back Gomer (Hosea 3:1-2), Christ paid the ultimate price to redeem His bride, demonstrating the infinite value He places on us despite our unfaithfulness.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "How does the 'price tag' mentioned in 1 Peter 1 deepen our understanding of God's commitment to this covenant relationship?"

#### B. The Bride Made Ready [*] ({Est. 5-6 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Revelation 19:7-8 - "Let us be glad and rejoice and give Him glory, for the **marriage of the Lamb has come**, and **His wife has made herself ready**. And to her it was granted to be arrayed in **fine linen, clean and bright**, for the fine linen is the **righteous acts of the saints**."
        -   Reading/Context: The glorious culmination! The Bride is finally ready for the wedding.
        -   [WB]: Rev 19:7-8 -> Wife Made Ready -> Fine Linen = Righteous Acts
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Readiness isn't passive. While the linen (righteousness) is "granted" (a gift through Christ), the bride "has made herself ready." This implies cooperation, choosing faithfulness, allowing Christ to work His righteousness *in* us, resulting in "righteous acts." This is the character perfection required.
        -   [EGW]: "By implanting in their hearts the principles of His word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes of God. The light of His glory—His character—is to shine forth in His followers. Thus they are to glorify God, to lighten the path to the Bridegroom's home..." (COL 414).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...His character... to shine forth..."
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Revelation 19 says the bride 'made herself ready,' yet the linen is 'granted.' How do we reconcile our effort and God's grace in becoming ready for Christ's return?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen God's profound covenant ideal from
  Scripture – His sacrificial love (Eph 5), His desire for oneness (Gen 2), His
  endowment of beauty (Ezek 16). We've also faced the biblical reality of our
  potential for devastating spiritual infidelity (Ezek 16, Hosea, Rev 17-18).
  But supremely, we've seen God's persistent, restoring love (Hosea 2) and His
  power to make us ready (Rev 19).
- Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** call is clear: absolute
  **faithfulness** within this sacred covenant. This isn't optional; it's the
  essence of readiness for the Marriage Supper. It requires the **character** of
  Christ, reflected in us.
  - [WB]: `FAITHFULNESS` / `HOLINESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: Let's heed the call of Revelation 18: "Come out" of
  any compromise. Let's respond to the wooing of Hosea 2. Let's cooperate with
  the sanctifying work of Ephesians 5. Choose **undivided allegiance** to Christ
  today.
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `"BE FAITHFUL" (Rev 2:10)` / `"MAKE READY" (Rev 19:7)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what is one
    specific area where you will ask God to help you be more faithful in your
    covenant relationship with Him this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The time is short. The Bridegroom is coming
  soon. Let us, by His grace, be found faithful, clothed in the righteousness He
  provides, ready and waiting with joy for that glorious day.
  - [EGW]: "Christ honored the marriage relation by making it also a symbol of
    the union between Him and His redeemed ones. He Himself is the Bridegroom;
    the bride is the church, of which, as His chosen one, He says, 'Thou art all
    fair, My love; there is no spot in thee.'” (MH 356).
  - [WB]: Final Hope: `Rev 19:9 "Blessed are those called..."` / `"MARANATHA!"`
