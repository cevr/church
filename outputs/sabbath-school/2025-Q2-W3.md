### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Think about the most intimate, committed human relationship possible – a faithful marriage. The Bible uses this powerful image to describe something even deeper: Christ's relationship with His people.
-   Theme Introduction: Today, we explore the **profound** theme of **Covenant Faithfulness**. This isn't just about earthly marriage, but the spiritual fidelity God desires from us as His Bride, preparing for the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. Understanding this depth is crucial for us living in the last days.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Covenant Faithfulness: Ready for the King?)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This faithfulness is directly linked to the character we must develop through Christ – the sanctification and perfection needed to stand ready for His appearing.
-   Roadmap: We'll examine God's ideal for this relationship, His own incredible faithfulness despite our failings, and the active preparation required of the Bride today.

### II. The Divine Ideal: Reflecting Christ's Faithful Love (10 mins)
-   **A. The 'One Flesh' Mystery - Unity with Christ:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God ordained marriage in Eden as a sacred symbol of the complete unity, intimacy, and shared purpose He desires between Christ and His Church. We are called to be "one spirit" with Him.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 2:24, Eph 5:31-32 - This "great mystery" points directly to Christ and the church. It's about inseparable connection and loyalty.
    -   EGW Insight: "Christ came not to destroy this institution, but to restore it to its original sanctity and elevation... He began His work by sanctioning the marriage relation." (AH 99.4). This shows the high standard.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: We often live fragmented lives, not fully integrating Christ into every part. This ideal calls us to complete surrender and unity.

-   **B. The Standard: Christ's Sacrificial Faithfulness:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The husband's love (Eph 5:25) mirrors Christ's love for the church – self-sacrificing, purifying, and utterly faithful, even unto death. This is the pattern for the church's response.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Eph 5:25-27 - He "gave Himself for her" to make her holy and blameless. His faithfulness enables ours.
    -   EGW Insight: "The spirit that Christ manifests toward the church is the spirit that husband and wife are to manifest toward each other." (7T 46.1). His character is our goal.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Selfishness, pride, and a lack of appreciation for Christ's sacrifice hinder our ability to reflect this faithful love.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A perfectly polished mirror accurately reflects the sun's glory. Our lives, united with Christ, should reflect His character. Sin dirties the mirror, distorting the reflection.
-   *Metaphor:* Christ is the ultimate Bridegroom, who didn't just send gifts, but gave His very life to win His bride.

-   *Verse:* Eph 5:32 ("...concerning Christ and the church.")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...gave Himself for her..." (Eph 5:25)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* In Ephesians 5, what specific actions did Christ take for the church that demonstrate His faithfulness?
-   *(Reflection):* Why do you think Paul calls the marriage union reflecting Christ and the church a "great mystery"? What makes it profound?
-   *(Application):* In our church family or our homes, what is one practical way we can demonstrate more self-sacrificing, faithful love this week, reflecting Christ's pattern?

### III. Divine Faithfulness Amidst Human Failure (10 mins)
-   **A. God's Redeeming Love for the Unlovely:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Ezekiel 16 portrays Israel (and us) as a destitute, abandoned child. God, in His incredible grace, chooses the unlovely, cleanses her, clothes her in splendor, and enters into a covenant (marriage) with her. Our worth comes entirely from His choice and His gifts.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ezek 16:8-14 - "I spread My wing over you... swore an oath to you and entered into a covenant with you, and you became Mine... your beauty was perfect through My splendor which I had bestowed on you."
    -   EGW Insight: "In both the Old and the New Testament, the marriage relation is employed to represent the tender and sacred union that exists between Christ and His people." (DA 151.2). Ezekiel shows the depth of this commitment from God's side.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: We are prone to spiritual pride, thinking our "beauty" or righteousness is our own. This passage reminds us it's all a gift of grace, combating self-reliance.

-   **B. God's Persistent Pursuit Despite Spiritual Adultery:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Hosea dramatically illustrates God's heartbroken but relentless love. Despite Israel's (Gomer's) repeated spiritual harlotry (idolatry, worldly alliances), God seeks to "allure her," speak tenderly, and ultimately betroth her to Himself "in righteousness and justice, in lovingkindness and mercy... in faithfulness."
    -   Biblical Foundation: Hosea 2:14-20 - God doesn't give up easily. His faithfulness persists even when ours fails, calling us back to fidelity.
    -   EGW Insight: "In symbolic language Hosea set before the ten tribes God's plan of restoring to every penitent soul who would unite with His church on earth, the blessings granted Israel..." (PK 298.1). God's desire is always restoration through faithfulness.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Worldliness, compromising our beliefs, seeking security in anything other than God – these are modern forms of spiritual adultery that God grieves over yet seeks to heal.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Imagine a master artist finding a discarded, broken piece of pottery, painstakingly restoring it, and declaring it a masterpiece – not because of its original state, but because of his work upon it. That's God with us.
-   *Hypothetical:* A loving spouse discovers infidelity but, instead of immediate rejection, patiently works to win back the straying partner's heart, demonstrating unwavering commitment. This mirrors God's heart in Hosea.

-   *Verse:* Ezek 16:14 ("Perfect through My splendor") / Hosea 2:19 ("Betroth you... forever... in faithfulness")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...you became Mine." (Ezek 16:8)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* In Ezekiel 16, what did God do for the abandoned child *before* entering the covenant? What does this tell us?
-   *(Reflection):* How does God's persistent love shown in Hosea, despite deep betrayal, challenge our human understanding of forgiveness and commitment?
-   *(Application):* What are some subtle ways we might be tempted toward "spiritual adultery" today (placing trust or affection elsewhere)? How can remembering God's faithfulness help us remain loyal?

### IV. Preparing the Bride: Separation and Sanctification (10-12 mins)
-   **A. The Call to Covenantal Separation:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Just as Abraham insisted Isaac not marry a Canaanite, preserving spiritual purity, God calls His end-time people to "Come out of Babylon," separating from worldly confusion, false worship, and compromising alliances. Faithfulness requires distinction.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 24:3-4; Rev 18:1-4 - The principle is timeless: God's covenant people must be distinct from surrounding influences that would lead them away from true worship and faithfulness.
    -   EGW Insight: Abraham feared the "corrupting influence surrounding his son" and sought a wife who would "not lead him from God." (DG 29.2). This same concern applies spiritually today regarding Babylon's influence.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The pressure to conform to the world's values and practices is immense. This calls for intentional choices to remain separate in principle and practice.

-   **B. Making Ourselves Ready: The Wedding Garment:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The Bride of Christ doesn't passively wait; she actively "has made herself ready." This readiness is symbolized by being granted "fine linen, clean and bright," representing the "righteous acts of the saints" – characters perfected through Christ's righteousness lived out by faith.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 19:7-8 - Readiness is both a gift ("granted") and a response ("made herself ready"). It involves cooperating with the Holy Spirit in the work of sanctification.
    -   EGW Insight: "By implanting in their hearts the principles of His word, the Holy Spirit develops in men the attributes of God. The light of His glory—His character—is to shine forth in His followers." (COL 414.3). This is how the Bride prepares.
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: This requires daily surrender, Bible study, prayer, obedience, and overcoming sin through Christ's power – actively weaving the robe of His righteousness into our characters.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* An ambassador living in a foreign country must represent their home nation faithfully, maintaining its values and not adopting practices contrary to their commission. We are ambassadors for heaven in the world (Babylon).
-   *Visual Metaphor:* Preparing for a royal wedding involves meticulous attention to the wedding garment. It must be spotless. Our character preparation requires similar diligence, allowing Christ to cleanse us.

-   *Verse:* Rev 18:4 ("Come out of her, my people") / Rev 19:8 ("Fine linen... righteous acts")
-   *Question:* Daily Preparation?

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* According to Revelation 19:8, what does the fine linen represent?
-   *(Reflection):* Why is separation from "Babylon" necessary for the Bride to make herself ready? What happens if she tries to blend in?
-   *(Application):* What is one specific "righteous act" – empowered by Christ – that you feel God is calling you to be more consistent in as part of "making yourself ready" this week?
