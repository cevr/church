**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Imagine standing in the very throne room of the universe. What would you see? What would you *feel*? Isaiah, Ezekiel, and John were given glimpses – glimpses that change everything.
-   Theme Introduction: This week, we explore the **profound** foundations revealed in these visions. It's not just about prophecy; it's about the very character of God, the origin of sin, and God's incredible plan to restore us to His presence – the heart of the Great Controversy.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Throne: Controversy & Restoration)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding God's holiness reveals our deep need. Seeing the controversy's root (pride vs. love) clarifies our path to sanctification. Our eternal destiny hinges on being made fit, through Christ, to dwell with God.
-   Roadmap: We'll look at: 1) Encountering God's holiness, 2) The root of the controversy, 3) God's desire to dwell with us, and 4) Christ's victory securing our place.

### II. Encountering the Throne: Holiness Revealed, Sin Exposed (8-10 mins)
-   **A. The Vision of Holiness:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Isaiah's vision (Isa 6:1-4) wasn't just impressive; it revealed God's **absolute** moral purity and separation from sin – His holiness. The seraphim cry, "Holy, Holy, Holy!" (Rev 4:8). This is the standard of the universe.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Isaiah 6:1-4 - Describe the scene briefly: high and lifted up, train filling temple, seraphim, smoke, shaking posts. Emphasize the threefold "Holy."
    -   EGW Insight: "As Isaiah beheld this revelation of the glory and majesty of his Lord, he was overwhelmed with a sense of the purity and holiness of God." (PK 307.3, adapted).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: We often have a casual view of God. Seeing His holiness confronts our self-sufficiency and reveals our true condition.

-   **B. The Human Response: Conviction and Cleansing:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Faced with divine holiness, Isaiah didn't feel worthy; he felt **undone** (Isa 6:5). Recognition of sinfulness is the first step toward God. But God doesn't leave us there; He provides cleansing.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Isaiah 6:5-7 - "Woe is me! For I am undone... unclean lips... my eyes have seen the King..." The seraph brings a coal from the altar (representing Christ's sacrifice/atonement) for purging.
    -   EGW Insight: "Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged." (PK 308.1). This is God's initiative, His grace.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: We might fear conviction or try to hide our sins. True depth comes from honest confession and accepting God's offered cleansing through Christ.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Like turning on a powerful spotlight in a seemingly clean room – suddenly, every speck of dust and flaw is visible. God's holiness reveals our hidden faults.
-   *Hypothetical:* Imagine being summoned before a perfectly just and righteous earthly king, knowing you've broken his laws. That fear, magnified infinitely, is a shadow of Isaiah's feeling.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* HOLINESS / UNDONE
-   *Diagram:* Throne -> Light -> Isaiah ("Woe!") -> Altar Coal -> Cleansed ("Send Me!")
-   *Verse:* Isa 6:3 ("Holy, Holy, Holy") / Isa 6:5 ("Woe is me!")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...thine iniquity is taken away..."

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "What specific words did Isaiah use to describe himself when he saw God's holiness?" (Undone, unclean lips).
-   *(Reflection):* "Why do you think seeing God's holiness leads to a feeling of being 'undone' rather than just impressed?"
-   *(Application):* "How can the symbol of the burning coal from the altar give us courage to approach God despite our sinfulness?" (Points to Christ's sacrifice).

### III. The Controversy's Origin: Self-Exaltation vs. God's Glory (7-9 mins) [*]
-   **A. The Covering Cherub's Choice:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The Great Controversy began not on earth, but in heaven, with Lucifer, a being of highest honor (covering cherub, Ezek 28:14). Sin originated in **pride** and **self-exaltation**, desiring the worship due only to God.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ezekiel 28:15-17 ("perfect... till iniquity found"; "heart lifted up because of beauty"; "corrupted wisdom by reason of brightness"); Isaiah 14:13-14 ("I will ascend... I will exalt my throne... I will be like the most High").
    -   EGW Insight: "Pride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy... He gloried in his brightness and exaltation, and aspired to be equal with God." (GC 495.1).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Understanding sin's root as self-centeredness helps us identify it in ourselves. The desire for recognition, position, or independence from God echoes Lucifer's fall.

-   **B. God's Character vs. Satan's Claims:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Satan misrepresented God's character, claiming His law was restrictive and He was unjust. The entire controversy is a battle over God's **character** of love, justice, and selflessness versus Satan's principle of self-interest.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Genesis 3:4-5 (Satan's lies about God). Contrast with John 3:16, Phil 2:5-8 (God's self-sacrificing love revealed in Christ).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: We are called to reflect God's character – humility, love, service – directly opposing the spirit of pride and self-seeking that caused the fall. This is central to our sanctification.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Imagine a brilliant orchestra conductor who starts subtly changing the music to draw attention to himself, eventually trying to push the composer off the stage. Lucifer tried to usurp the Creator's place.
-   *Idiom:* Lucifer wanted to "steal God's thunder," claiming the glory for himself.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* PRIDE / SELF-EXALTATION
-   *Diagram:* God (Love/Glory) <- Lucifer (Pride/Self) -> Fall
-   *Verse:* Isa 14:13 ("I will...") / Ezek 28:17 ("Heart lifted up")
-   *Contrast:* God's Character (Love, Selfless) vs. Satan's (Pride, Selfish)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What position did Lucifer hold before his fall, according to Ezekiel?" (Covering cherub).
-   *(Reflection):* "How does understanding Lucifer's fall help us see the danger in even 'small' feelings of pride or wanting our own way instead of God's?"
-   *(Application):* "In what practical ways can we actively choose humility and focus on God's glory rather than our own in our daily lives or church interactions?"

### IV. God's Presence Among His People: Restoration Foreshadowed (7-9 mins)
-   **A. From Eden's Gate to the Sanctuary:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Though sin separated humanity from God (Gen 3:22-24), God immediately planned restoration. The cherubim at Eden's gate, while guarding, also marked a place of divine presence (*shakan* - where God tabernacled/dwelt). This foreshadowed the Sanctuary, where God explicitly dwelt among His people.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Genesis 3:24 (Cherubim placed); Exodus 25:8, 22 ("Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell [*shakan*] among them... I will meet with thee... from between the two cherubims"). Numbers 2 (Camp layout centered on Tabernacle).
    -   EGW Insight: "At the cherubim-guarded gate of Paradise the divine glory was revealed. Hither came Adam and his sons to worship God." (PP 62.2). God desires fellowship.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Sin creates distance, but God constantly works to bridge that gap and dwell with His people, showing His desire for relationship.

-   **B. The Throne Room Reality:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The visions of God's throne (Ezekiel 1, Revelation 4-5) show the ultimate reality: God surrounded by heavenly beings (including cherubim/living creatures) who constantly acknowledge His worthiness as Creator and Ruler. This is the destiny He plans for the redeemed.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ezekiel 1:10, 10:14-15 (Living creatures/cherubim); Revelation 4:6-11 (Living creatures, elders, worshiping the Creator).
    -   EGW Insight: "From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a temple for the indwelling of the Creator." (DA 161.1).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Understanding God's desire to dwell with us fuels our hope for the New Jerusalem where "the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them" (Rev 21:3).

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Visual Metaphor:* Like a King setting up His royal tent right in the middle of His army's camp – showing solidarity, protection, and accessibility.
-   *Analogy:* A parent longs for their estranged child to come home; God made provision through the sanctuary and ultimately Christ for us to return to His presence.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* DWELL / *SHAKAN* / PRESENCE
-   *Diagram:* Eden Gate (Cherubim) -> Sanctuary (Cherubim/Ark) -> Heavenly Throne (Living Creatures/Cherubim) -> New Earth (God with Us)
-   *Verse:* Ex 25:8 / Rev 4:11 ("Worthy... created all things")
-   *Concept:* God moving TOWARD humanity.

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "Where were the cherubim located in the sanctuary?" (On the Ark, woven into curtains). "What does this placement suggest?" (Close to God's presence/throne).
-   *(Reflection):* "How does the idea that God *desires* to dwell among His people, even after sin, impact your view of His character?"
-   *(Application):* "Knowing God wants to dwell with us, how can we consciously invite His presence into our lives and homes this week?"

### V. The Resolution: Christ's Victory and Our Place Restored (5-7 mins)
-   **A. The Lamb Who is Worthy:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The climax of the throne room vision (Rev 5) reveals the solution to the controversy and the basis for our restoration: **Jesus Christ**, the Lamb slain. Only He, through His sacrifice, is worthy to redeem and restore.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Revelation 5:1-10 - No one worthy *but* the Lamb. He purchased people "out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation."
    -   EGW Insight: "Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain!" (GC 648.1, quoting Adam). His death vindicated God's character and paid our ransom.
    -   Application/Need Met: Our unworthiness (like Isaiah's) finds its answer only in Christ's worthiness and His righteousness imputed to us.

-   **B. Humanity Restored to God's Presence:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Through Christ's victory, humanity is not only forgiven but **restored** to an incredibly high position, filling the places vacated by Satan and his angels, destined to dwell eternally in God's presence.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Revelation 5:10 ("made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth."); Rev 22:3-4 ("the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it... and they shall see his face").
    -   EGW Insight: "Heaven will triumph, for the vacancies made in heaven by the fall of Satan and his angels will be filled by the redeemed of the Lord." (ARSH May 29, 1900, cited in lesson). See also GC 677.1.
    -   Application/Our Calling: This incredible destiny motivates our response: "Here am I! Send me!" (Isa 6:8). We are called to be witnesses of this redemption, reflecting the character of the One who restored us.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Like a king adopting former street orphans, cleansing them, clothing them in royal robes, and giving them seats of honor at his own table, replacing disgraced former courtiers.
-   *Metaphor:* Christ built a bridge across the chasm of sin, allowing us to cross back into the presence of God.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* LAMB SLAIN / WORTHY / RESTORED
-   *Diagram:* Cross -> Empty Tomb -> Ascension -> Throne (Lamb Worthy) -> Redeemed Before Throne
-   *Verse:* Rev 5:9 ("purchased us") / Rev 5:12 ("Worthy is the Lamb")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...vacancies... filled by the redeemed..."

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Revelation 5, why is the Lamb declared 'worthy'?" (Because He was slain and purchased people with His blood).
-   *(Reflection):* "What does the idea of the redeemed 'filling the vacancies' left by fallen angels suggest about God's ultimate plan and the value He places on humanity?"
-   *(Application):* "How does knowing our potential destiny—standing before the throne, restored—affect how we should live our lives *now* as ambassadors for Christ?"

### VI. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: We've glimpsed the awe of God's throne, the holiness that exposes our sin, the origin of the controversy in pride, God's persistent desire to dwell with us, and the ultimate victory through Christ the Lamb, who restores us to God's presence.
-   Character Focus Recap: The Great Controversy is about character – God's character of love vindicated, Satan's character of self exposed, and **our** characters being transformed by grace to reflect Jesus, fit for eternity.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: HUMILITY / LOVE / FAITHFULNESS)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Seeing God's holiness and Christ's sacrifice calls for a response. Will we, like Isaiah, acknowledge our need, accept the cleansing He offers, and say, "Here am I, Lord, transform me and use me"? Let us surrender daily to His refining work.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SURRENDER / ACCEPT / REFLECT)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What one aspect of God's character revealed today do you most want His help to reflect this week?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The throne room isn't just history or future; it's a present reality. Christ intercedes for us there now. He is coming soon to take His redeemed home. Let us live in readiness, filled with hope.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 22:12 / "He Comes to Restore!")*
    -   "Christ looks upon the redeemed, renewed in His own image... He beholds in them the result of the travail of His soul, and He is satisfied." (GC 671.1). May we be among that number.
