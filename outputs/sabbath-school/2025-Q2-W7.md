## Foundations for Prophecy

**Overarching Theme:** Restoration to God's Presence: Qualifying for the Kingdom
Through Divine Encounter and Cleansing **Central Focus:** Understanding that
drawing near to God's revealed glory exposes our profound need, necessitates His
divine cleansing initiated through Christ, and qualifies us—by grace through
faith—for service now and eternal dwelling in His restored presence, perfecting
His character in us. **Key Texts:** Isaiah 6:1-8, Ezekiel 1:26-28, Genesis
3:22-24, Revelation 5:9-12, Isaiah 14:12-14

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Imagine suddenly being ushered into the very throne room of the
  universe, before the blazing glory of a perfectly Holy God. What would be your
  first thought? Your first feeling? Isaiah and Ezekiel give us a glimpse.
- Theme Introduction: Today we explore a **profound** biblical journey:
  **Restoration to God's Presence.** It’s not just about prophecy's foundation,
  but the foundation of our relationship with God – how sinful beings can
  possibly stand before, serve, and ultimately dwell with a Holy God.
  Understanding this **scriptural depth** is **CRITICAL** for us living in these
  last days.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Restoration to God's Presence"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The Bible calls us to perfection, to reflect
  Christ's character fully (Matt 5:48). This isn't optional; it's preparation
  for eternity in God's presence. Our study today reveals the **only** way this
  transformation happens – through encountering God and embracing His remedy.
- Roadmap: We'll examine the **biblical** accounts of encountering God's
  holiness (Isaiah/Ezekiel), understand the resulting crisis of our sinfulness,
  explore God's amazing provision for cleansing and access
  (Isaiah/Genesis/Revelation), contrast this with the path of self-destruction
  (Lucifer), and grasp our high calling.

### II. Encountering the Holy: Seeing God and Ourselves (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Before we can appreciate the solution, we must
  understand the problem. Scripture shows that a true view of God inevitably
  reveals our own condition.

#### A. Isaiah's Vision: God's Majesty & Human Undoing (Isa 6:1-5) (Est. 8-9 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Isaiah 6:1-4
        -   Reading/Context: Read these verses describing the awesome scene Isaiah witnessed – the Lord high and lifted up, the seraphim, the holiness, the shaking temple.
        -   [WB]: Isaiah 6:1-4 / HOLY, HOLY, HOLY / THRONE
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This isn't just imagery; it's the reality of God's supreme majesty, purity, and power. The threefold "Holy" emphasizes perfection beyond our comprehension.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What specific details in verses 1-4 emphasize God's majesty and holiness?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Isaiah 6:5
        -   Reading/Connection: Read Isaiah's reaction. Seeing God's holiness immediately reveals his *own* state and that of his people.
        -   [WB]: Isa 6:5 -> "Woe is me! I am UNDONE!" / Unclean Lips
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Isaiah, a prophet, felt utterly ruined ("undone") – disintegrated in the light of perfect holiness. This wasn't false humility; it was stark reality. It reveals our inherent sinfulness and desperate need.
        -   [EGW]: "As Isaiah beheld this revelation of the glory and majesty of his Lord, he was overwhelmed with a sense of the purity and holiness of God. How sharp the contrast between the matchless perfection of his Creator, and the sinful course of those who, with himself, had long been numbered among the chosen people... ‘Woe is me!’ he cried; ‘for I am undone...’" ([PK 307.3]).
        -   [WB]: Contrast: God's Holiness <-> Our Sinfulness
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why did seeing God's holiness make Isaiah feel 'undone' and 'unclean'? What does this teach us about ourselves?"

#### B. Ezekiel's Vision: The Fiery Glory & Divine Order (Ezek 1:26-28, 10:1-2) (Est. 7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Ezekiel 1:26-28
        -   Reading/Context: Briefly describe Ezekiel's vision – the wheels, the living creatures (cherubim), and above them, the throne with the likeness of the glory of the LORD, like a rainbow in the cloud.
        -   [WB]: Ezek 1:26-28 / GLORY of the LORD / Rainbow (Mercy)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Similar to Isaiah, Ezekiel sees God's indescribable glory, power, and presence. The rainbow, symbol of God's covenant faithfulness and mercy (Gen 9), surrounds the throne even amidst judgment.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Ezekiel 10:1-2 (Connects to Isa 6:6)
        -   Reading/Connection: Note the cherubim and the command to take coals of fire from between them – linking to the source of purification in Isaiah's experience.
        -   [WB]: Ezek 10:1-2 / Cherubim / Coals of FIRE
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: These visions reinforce God's awesome holiness and His sovereign control over all events.
        -   [EGW]: "As the wheel-like complications were under the guidance of the hand beneath the wings of the cherubim, so the complicated play of human events is under divine control. Amidst the strife and tumult of nations, He that sitteth above the cherubim still guides the affairs of this earth." ([TAA 138.1]).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of trying to look directly at the sun – its brightness is overwhelming, almost painful. God's holiness is infinitely brighter, revealing every speck of dust, every flaw in us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing God is both perfectly holy and merciful (the rainbow), how should this affect our approach to Him in prayer and worship?"

### III. Bridging the Gulf: Divine Cleansing, Guarded Hope, and Worthiness in Christ (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Seeing our need is step one. But God doesn't
  leave us undone. He initiates the way back to His presence, providing
  cleansing, guarding hope, and ultimately, worthiness through Christ.

#### A. Purged for Presence and Purpose (Isa 6:6-8) (Est. 5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Isaiah 6:6-7
        -   Reading/Context: Read how the seraph brings the live coal from the altar and touches Isaiah's lips.
        -   [WB]: Isa 6:6-7 / ALTAR / Live COAL / "Iniquity TAKEN AWAY" / "Sin PURGED"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The **altar** represents sacrifice and atonement (pointing to Christ). The **coal** represents divine purification. God Himself provides the cleansing needed for Isaiah to stand in His presence. This isn't self-improvement; it's divine intervention.
        -   [EGW]: "A living coal from the altar was laid upon his lips, with the words, ‘Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.’" ([PK 308.1]). We need this same work. "We want the living coal from off the altar placed upon our lips. We want to hear the word spoken, ‘Thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged’" ([RH June 4, 1889, par. 10]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "What does the act of the seraph with the coal teach us about how we are made fit for God's presence?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Isaiah 6:8
        -   Reading/Connection: Read God's call and Isaiah's immediate, willing response *after* being cleansed.
        -   [WB]: Isa 6:8 -> "Whom shall I send?" -> "HERE AM I! SEND ME."
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Cleansing leads to commission. Once forgiven and purified, the natural response is surrender and service. Our purpose is found in aligning our will with God's. Readiness for service requires divine preparation.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How does experiencing God's forgiveness and cleansing change our willingness to serve Him, even in difficult tasks?"

#### B. Guarded Access & Promised Restoration (Gen 3:21-24) (Est. 5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Genesis 3:21-24
        -   Reading/Context: After the fall, God provides coverings (sacrifice implied) but also bars access to the Tree of Life with cherubim and a flaming sword.
        -   [WB]: Gen 3:21-24 / Coats of Skin (Sacrifice) / CHERUBIM / Flaming Sword / GUARDED Tree of Life
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God provides a temporary covering (pointing to Christ's righteousness) but must guard the way to eternal life because sin cannot be allowed to perpetuate eternally. The cherubim, however, also became a place where God's glory was revealed (PP 62), a symbol of hope that access *would* be restored.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a quarantine zone. It's necessary to prevent spread, but the hope is always for healing and restoration of access. The Garden gate was guarded *until* the remedy for sin was fully applied.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What dual message do we see in God placing cherubim at the gate of Eden (both judgment and hope)?"

#### C. Worthiness Through the Lamb & The Contrast (Rev 5:9-12, Isa 14:12-14) (Est. 5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 5:9-12
        -   Reading/Context: Read the song of the redeemed in heaven – they are worthy *because* the Lamb was slain and purchased them with His blood.
        -   [WB]: Rev 5:9-12 / WORTHY is the LAMB / Slain / Purchased us by BLOOD
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Our worthiness isn't inherent. It comes solely through Christ's sacrifice. He bridges the infinite gap between our sinfulness and God's holiness. This is the **only** foundation for our restoration.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Isaiah 14:12-14 (Contrast)
        -   Reading/Connection: Read Lucifer's boast – "I will ascend... I will exalt my throne... I will be like the Most High." Contrast this with the Lamb's humility and sacrifice.
        -   [WB]: Isa 14:12-14 -> Lucifer: "I WILL..." (Self-Exaltation) -> FALL
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Lucifer's fall stemmed from pride and self-exaltation, desiring God's position without His character of self-sacrificing love. This is the root of sin. Our restoration requires the opposite spirit – humility, dependence, surrender, accepting Christ's worthiness.
        -   [EGW]: "Pride in his own glory nourished the desire for supremacy... He gloried in his brightness and exaltation, and aspired to be equal with God." ([GC 495.1]). This path leads only to exclusion. Christ's path leads to restoration.
        -   [DQ]: *(Synthesis):* "Comparing Lucifer's fall (Isa 14) with the song of the redeemed (Rev 5), what is the fundamental difference in attitude and character required to be in God's presence?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've journeyed through Scripture seeing God's
  awesome holiness (Isa 6, Ezek 1), our resulting sense of being 'undone' (Isa
  6:5), God's gracious provision of cleansing through sacrifice (Isa 6:6-7, Gen
  3:21, Rev 5), the guarded hope of restoration (Gen 3:24), and the stark
  contrast between self-exalting pride that excludes (Isa 14) and humble
  reliance on Christ that restores (Rev 5).
- Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** call is clear: we cannot remain
  content with 'unclean lips.' God desires to purge us, to cleanse us with the
  'live coal' of His Spirit, applying Christ's sacrifice, that we might reflect
  His **holy character** perfectly. This is not optional for those awaiting His
  return.
  - [WB]: {Key Character Trait: `HOLINESS` / `HUMILITY`}
- Call to Action/Decision: Have you, like Isaiah, truly seen your need in the
  light of God's holiness? Have you allowed the 'live coal' of Christ's
  sacrifice and Spirit to touch your heart, purging your sin? Don't shrink from
  the light! Embrace the cleansing He offers. Surrender your will, your pride,
  your 'unclean lips' to Him today.
  - [WB]: {Call to Action Keyword: `"BE YE HOLY"` (1 Pet 1:16) / `"SURRENDER"`}
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what specific area
    of pride or uncleanness will you surrender to Christ for His purging fire
    this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The vacancies left by Satan and his angels
  _will_ be filled by the redeemed ([ARSH May 29, 1900]). Christ looks upon His
  redeemed, renewed in His image, and He is satisfied ([GC 671.2]). Let us
  cooperate fully with His work of restoration in us, that we may be ready to
  stand in His presence, not undone, but complete in Him.
  - [WB]: {Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: `Rev 22:4` /
    `"HIS FACE... HIS NAME"`}
