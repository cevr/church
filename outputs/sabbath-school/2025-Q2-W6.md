### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "What is the most valuable thing anyone could ever give up? Today we explore a sacrifice of **infinite** value, one that changes everything for us, for eternity."
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: The Infinite Cost of Redemption and the Unique Worthiness of the Slain Lamb. Why understanding this depth is **CRITICAL** for true faith, not just ritual.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: The Worthy Lamb & His Infinite Sacrifice)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just history; understanding the cost reveals sin's horror and God's love, motivating **character transformation** (sanctification) essential for meeting Jesus.
-   Roadmap: Briefly outline the journey:
    -   Why animal sacrifices were insufficient.
    -   Who the true Lamb is and why He alone qualifies.
    -   The heavenly perspective on His worthiness.
    -   Our personal response.

### II. The Shadow vs. The Substance: Why Only Christ Could Atone (10 mins)
-   **A. Futile Rituals & Insufficient Blood:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Sacrifices done without faith or attempting to earn favor (like Cain's) are **worthless**. Even God-ordained animal sacrifices could **never** truly take away sin; they were only pointers (shadows).
    -   Biblical Foundation: Isa 1:11-15 (God rejecting empty ritual); Heb 10:4 ("For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins."). Explain *why* - sin affects our very nature and relationship with a holy God; only a divine sacrifice could bridge that gap.
    -   EGW Insight: "Abel trusted wholly in the merits of the atoning sacrifice of Christ... Cain doubted and rebelled." (ST Feb 6, 1879, par. 6). Contrast self-reliance vs. faith in the **promised** Redeemer.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The danger of "going through the motions" in religion vs. genuine heart-surrender based on Christ's merit alone.

-   **B. The Purpose of the Types:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The sacrificial system was God's ordained object lesson, a "mini-prophecy," constantly pointing forward to the **real** sacrifice – the **substance** – Jesus Christ.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Heb 9:8-12 (Earthly sanctuary service temporary, pointing to Christ entering heaven with His *own* blood); John 1:29 ("Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!").
    -   EGW Insight: "The types and shadows of the sacrificial service... gave the Israelites a veiled, indistinct view... pointing to Christ." (RH Apr 22, 1902, par. 6). They taught the **cost** of sin (death) and the **need** for a substitute.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Failing to see Christ in the Old Testament types diminishes our understanding of His work's fullness.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A blueprint (type) is essential for planning, but you can't live in the blueprint; you need the actual house (antitype - Christ).
-   *Metaphor:* Counterfeit money might look real, but it has no actual value. Self-righteous works or empty rituals are like counterfeit currency before God; only Christ's sacrifice is the true payment.

-   *Verse:* Heb 10:4 / John 1:29
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...not possible..." (Heb 10:4)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to Hebrews 10:4, what could the blood of animals *not* do?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it sometimes tempting for us to rely on 'doing' religious things rather than fully trusting in what Christ *has done*?"
-   *(Application):* "How does understanding that animal sacrifices were insufficient deepen your appreciation for Jesus' sacrifice?"

### III. The Perfect Lamb, The Perfect Revelation (10 mins)
-   **A. The Spotless Lamb Provided:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Jesus fulfilled the type perfectly. He was the sinless, spotless Lamb (1 Pet 1:19), living a life of perfect obedience and dying a substitutionary death He did not deserve.
    -   Biblical Foundation: 1 Pet 1:18-19 ("...redeemed... with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."); Isa 53:7 ("He was led as a lamb to the slaughter..."); 1 Cor 5:7 ("...For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us."). His perfection qualified Him.
    -   EGW Insight: "In body as in soul He was an example of what God designed all humanity to be through obedience to His laws." (MH 51.2). His perfect life met the law's demands.
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Recognizing Christ's perfection highlights our imperfection and **absolute need** for His righteousness imputed to us. It calls us to **abhor** sin, which cost Him so dearly.

-   **B. Sacrifice Reveals God's Character:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Christ's incarnation ("God with us" - Matt 1:23) and ultimate sacrifice on the cross are the **clearest revelation** of God's true character – His infinite love, justice, and self-sacrificing nature, refuting Satan's lies.
    -   Biblical Foundation: John 14:9 ("He who has seen Me has seen the Father"); Rom 5:8 ("But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."). Haggai 2:7-9 promised the second temple's glory would be greater - fulfilled by Christ's **presence**.
    -   EGW Insight: "It will be seen that the glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love... the law of self-renouncing love is the law of life for earth and heaven..." (DA 19.2). The cross vindicates God.
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Understanding God's true character through Christ's sacrifice builds unwavering trust, essential for standing firm through end-time trials when God's character is under final attack.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Visual Metaphor:* Christ is the perfect, untarnished mirror reflecting the Father's true character of love and justice. Sin smudges our reflection, but His sacrifice cleanses the mirror.
-   *Analogy:* Imagine someone having an insurmountable debt they could never repay. A billionaire friend steps in and pays the entire debt **in full**. Christ paid our infinite sin debt.

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What specific quality of the Passover lamb did Peter apply to Jesus in 1 Peter 1?" (Without blemish/spot)
-   *(Reflection):* "How does Christ's willingness to be the 'Lamb slain' change your perception of God's character, especially His justice and love?"
-   *(Application):* "If Christ perfectly revealed the Father, what aspect of His character revealed in the sacrifice do you most need God's help to reflect in your own life this week?"

### IV. Enthroned Worthiness: The Heavenly Perspective (10 mins) [*]
-   **A. The Lamb Slain is Found Worthy:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: In the crucial throne room scene (Rev 4-5), only Jesus, the Lamb appearing "as though it had been slain," is found **worthy** to open the scroll (God's plan/judgment) because His sacrifice **redeemed** humanity and **vindicated** God.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 5:4-6, 9 ("John wept... no one found worthy... 'Behold, the Lion... the Lamb as though it had been slain... For You were slain, and have redeemed us...'"). His sacrifice is the basis of His authority and our salvation.
    -   EGW Insight: "In all the universe there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its [the law's] claims... None but Christ could redeem fallen man from the curse of the law..." (PP 63.2). His unique nature (God-man) and sacrifice made Him solely worthy.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Feelings of unworthiness are answered not by self-improvement, but by looking to the **worthiness** of the Lamb who represents us.

-   **B. Creation and Redemption United:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Heaven praises the Lamb not only for redemption ("You were slain") but also acknowledges God's authority as Creator (Rev 4:11 - "You created all things"). Christ, the agent of creation (John 1:3), is also our Redeemer, showing the depth of His love and rightful authority.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 4:11; Rev 5:12 ("Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honor and glory and blessing!"). His worthiness encompasses both His creative power and redemptive love.
    -   EGW Insight: "Christ made manifest the character of the Father. He was so perfectly connected with God... that he who had seen the Son, had seen the Father." (RH Jan 7, 1890, par. 2). Seeing the Lamb reveals the Creator-Redeemer God.
    -   Application/Great Controversy Link: Christ's demonstrated worthiness through sacrifice is the ultimate answer to Satan's accusations against God's government and character. Our allegiance rests on His proven worth.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A coronation ceremony. Only the rightful heir, proven valiant and true (through sacrifice), is crowned King. Jesus earned the right to execute God's plan.
-   *Hypothetical Example:* Imagine a complex legal case where someone's character is unjustly attacked. Then, irrefutable evidence (Christ's life and death) is presented, completely vindicating them and silencing all accusers. The throne room scene is a cosmic vindication.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* WORTHY / REDEEMED / CREATOR
-   *Diagram:* Lamb (Slain) -> Opens Scroll -> Receives Worship
-   *Verse:* Rev 5:9 / Rev 5:12
-   *Question:* WHY is He Worthy? (Answer: Sacrifice/Redemption)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Revelation 5, why was John weeping initially? What changed his weeping to worship?"
-   *(Reflection):* "What does it mean personally to you that the One who created you is also the One who died to redeem you?"
-   *(Application):* "How can focusing on the *worthiness* of Christ, rather than our own failures, give us strength and assurance, especially as we think about the judgment?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Reiterate the profound truth: Animal sacrifices pointed forward but were powerless. Only Jesus, the **perfect**, **spotless Lamb**, could offer the **infinite sacrifice** required. Heaven itself declares Him **uniquely worthy** because He was slain and redeemed us.
-   Character Focus Recap: Understanding this immense cost must lead to a hatred of sin and a deep desire to reflect the character of the One who paid it all. This transformation is **essential preparation** for His coming.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: GRATITUDE / SURRENDER)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Don't let this be just head knowledge. Will you **personally accept** the infinite value of His sacrifice? Will you **surrender** the sins He died for? Will you **cooperate** daily with His Spirit to develop a character fit for heaven?
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: ACCEPT / YIELD / REFLECT)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Seeing the infinite price paid, what one thing feels 'too small' to surrender to Him now?" (Rhetorical for reflection)
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: "The cross... should show us two things: first, just how much God loves us... second... just how sinful and fallen we are that only through the cross could we be saved." (Lesson, p. 51). Let us live in the light of His sacrifice, preparing eagerly for His return!
    -   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 5:12 / "Worthy is the Lamb!")*
