## Understanding Sacrifice

**Overarching Theme:** The Unveiling of God's Character Through Perfect
Sacrifice: Our Path to Restoration **Central Focus:** Grasping the **infinite
cost** of sin and the **perfect character** revealed in Christ's sacrifice,
compelling us toward **complete surrender** and **character transformation** for
end-time readiness. **Key Texts:** Hebrews 10:4-10, 1 Peter 1:18-19, Revelation
5:6-12

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Why did God institute animal sacrifices, knowing they couldn't truly
  take away sin? What profound truth was He teaching from the very beginning?
  (Reference Gen 4, Heb 10:4)
- Theme Introduction: Today we explore "Understanding Sacrifice," not just as a
  historical ritual, but as God's profound method of revealing His **holy
  character** (His justice and mercy) and providing the **only path** for
  restoring His image in fallen humanity.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Perfect Sacrifice: God's Character Revealed,
    Our Character Restored"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding the **depth** of Christ's
  sacrifice is **CRITICAL** for grasping the standard of character required for
  heaven and the urgency of cooperating with God in our sanctification **now**.
  It's about readiness for His return.
- Roadmap: We'll examine why blood was required (the shadow), behold the
  perfection of the Lamb (the substance), and see the ultimate revelation in the
  throne room, leading to our response.

### II. The Shadow and the Substance: Why Blood? (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The Old Testament sacrificial system wasn't
  arbitrary; it was a divine object lesson pointing to a deeper reality.

#### A. The Necessary Lesson of the Shadow ({Est. Time: 6-7 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Leviticus 17:11
        -   Reading/Context: "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement for the soul."
        -   [WB]: {Lev 17:11 / Life = Blood = Atonement}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God established a principle: Sin costs **life**. The shedding of blood represented the forfeiture of life, the consequence of transgressing God's holy law. This wasn't about appeasing an angry God, but teaching the **deadly seriousness** of sin.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What connection does Leviticus 17:11 make between life, blood, and atonement?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Hebrews 9:22
        -   Reading/Connection: "And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission." This reinforces the principle from Leviticus.
        -   [WB]: {Heb 9:22 -> No Blood = No Remission (Forgiveness)}
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This system highlighted humanity's desperate state. Our sin separates us from a holy God. We need cleansing, forgiveness, *remission* – something we cannot provide ourselves. It points to our need for an external solution, a substitute.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a debt you cannot possibly pay. The sacrificial system was like God showing us the bill, emphasizing how serious the debt of sin is, making us realize we need someone else to pay it.
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 10:4
        -   Reading/Challenge: "For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins."
        -   [WB]: {Animal Blood ≠ Takes Away Sin}
        -   The Limitation & Pointing Forward: The sacrifices themselves were **powerless** to change the heart or truly cleanse the conscience. They were types, shadows, pointing forward to the **true** sacrifice.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like a signpost pointing to a city. The signpost isn't the city, but it directs you there. The sacrifices pointed to Christ.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "If animal sacrifices couldn't truly take away sin (Heb 10:4), what was their main purpose according to these verses and the illustrations?"

#### B. The Contrast: Acceptable vs. Futile Sacrifice ({Est. Time: 4-5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Genesis 4:3-5 (Context of Cain & Abel)
        -   Reading/Context: Cain brought fruit (his own works, self-sufficient); Abel brought the firstborn flock (blood sacrifice, acknowledging need, faith in God's way). God respected Abel's offering, not Cain's.
        -   [WB]: {Abel (Faith/Blood) vs. Cain (Works/Self)}
        -   The Heart Matters: The issue wasn't just *what* was offered, but the **attitude** and **faith** behind it. Abel came God's way, acknowledging sin and trusting the promised Redeemer (Gen 3:15). Cain came his own way.
        -   [EGW]: "Abel grasped the great principles of redemption. He saw himself a sinner... He brought the slain victim... thus acknowledging the claims of the law... Through the shed blood he looked to the future sacrifice, Christ..." (`Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 72`).
        -   [WB]: {EGW: "Grasped... redemption... slain victim"}
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How might we, like Cain, risk offering 'futile sacrifices' today, even in our religious activities, if our hearts aren't surrendered in faith?"

### III. Behold the Lamb: Perfection Personified (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The entire system pointed to One specific
  sacrifice – the perfect, spotless Lamb of God.

#### A. The Antitype Arrives: Spotless and Precious ({Est. Time: 6-7 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** John 1:29
        -   Reading/Context: John the Baptist sees Jesus: "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"
        -   [WB]: {John 1:29 - "Lamb of God"}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This wasn't just *any* lamb. This was **God's** Lamb, the divinely appointed, ultimate sacrifice anticipated for millennia. He doesn't just *cover* sin; He **takes it away**.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What is significant about John calling Jesus the 'Lamb of God' specifically?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Peter 1:18-19
        -   Reading/Connection: "knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold... but with the **precious blood** of Christ, as of a lamb **without blemish and without spot**."
        -   [WB]: {1 Pet 1:19 - Precious Blood / Without Blemish/Spot}
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Standard: The value isn't just the blood, but the **perfection** of the One shedding it. Christ's sinless life, His perfect character reflecting God's law, gave His sacrifice infinite worth. This perfection is the standard God desires restored in us.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine trying to buy a priceless masterpiece. No amount of ordinary currency (silver or gold, our own efforts) would suffice. Only something equally priceless could purchase it. Christ's perfect life and willing death was that infinitely precious price for our redemption.
        -   [EGW]: "Physically as well as spiritually He was represented by the sacrificial lamb, 'without blemish and without spot.' 1 Peter 1:19. In body as in soul He was an example of what God designed all humanity to be through obedience to His laws." (`The Ministry of Healing, p. 51`).
        -   [WB]: {EGW: "Example... what God designed humanity to be"}
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why was it essential for the Lamb of God to be 'without blemish and without spot'? What does this teach us about God's standard and the seriousness of sin?"

#### B. The Passover Fulfilled ({Est. Time: 4-5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 12:5, 13
        -   Reading/Context: The Passover lamb had to be "without blemish." Its blood on the doorposts protected Israel from the destroyer. "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."
        -   [WB]: {Ex 12 - Passover Lamb -> Protection by Blood}
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** 1 Corinthians 5:7
        -   Reading/Connection: "For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us."
        -   [WB]: {1 Cor 5:7 - Christ = Our Passover}
        -   Application Bridge: Christ is the fulfillment. His sacrifice wasn't just symbolic; it provides **real protection** from the consequence of sin (eternal death) for all who apply His blood by faith.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a perfect shield. The Passover blood was a temporary shield for one night; Christ's blood is the eternal, perfect shield against the penalty of God's broken law, available through faith every moment.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing Christ is our Passover Lamb, how should we personally 'apply His blood' to our lives today for protection and deliverance from sin?"

### IV. The Throne Room Revelation: Worthiness and Redemption [*] (10 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The ultimate significance of the sacrifice is
  revealed not just on earth, but in the very throne room of God.

#### A. Holiness, Unworthiness, and the Slain Lamb ({Est. Time: 5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Isaiah 6:1-5
        -   Reading/Context: Isaiah sees the Lord, high and lifted up. Seraphim cry "Holy, holy, holy!" Isaiah cries, "Woe is me, for I am undone!... For my eyes have seen the King..."
        -   [WB]: {Isaiah 6 - God's Holiness -> Human Unworthiness}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: A true vision of God's holiness instantly reveals our own sinfulness and utter unworthiness. This is the universal human condition before a holy God.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like holding up a dirty garment against pure, bright sunlight. Every stain and flaw becomes instantly visible. Seeing God's perfect holiness exposes our own spiritual 'dirt'.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why does seeing God's holiness make us immediately aware of our own sinfulness, like Isaiah?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Revelation 5:4, 6
        -   Reading/Connection: John weeps because no one is found worthy to open the scroll. Then he sees "a Lamb as though it had been slain, standing in the midst of the throne."
        -   [WB]: {Rev 5 - No one worthy... BUT the Slain Lamb}
        -   The Contrast: Heaven itself acknowledges that no created being, based on their own merit, is worthy. Only the Lamb, precisely **because** He was slain, is worthy. His sacrifice is the basis of all worthiness before God.

#### B. Worthy is the Lamb! ({Est. Time: 5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Revelation 5:9-10
        -   Reading/Context: The new song: "You are worthy... for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made us kings and priests to our God..."
        -   [WB]: {Rev 5:9 - Worthy BECAUSE Slain -> Redeemed Us}
        -   Redemption & Restoration: Christ's sacrifice didn't just cover sin; it **redeemed** us (bought us back) and began the process of **restoration** ("made us kings and priests"), restoring God's original purpose for humanity.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 5:12
        -   Reading/Challenge: The loud voice of many angels: "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing!"
        -   [WB]: {"WORTHY IS THE LAMB!"}
        -   Vindication & Our Response: The sacrifice vindicates God's character against Satan's accusations. It demonstrates His infinite love and perfect justice. Our response should be worship, adoration, and **complete surrender** to this worthy Lamb.
        -   [EGW]: "Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only one equal with God could make atonement for its transgression... Christ would take upon Himself the guilt and shame of sin... Christ would reach to the depths of misery to rescue the ruined race." (`Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 63`).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Like a king who pays an impossible debt for a traitorous subject out of pure love, not only pardoning him but elevating him to a position of honor in the kingdom. This is what Christ did for us through His sacrifice.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Seeing the Lamb declared 'Worthy' in heaven because He was slain, how does this motivate us to live lives worthy of His sacrifice here on earth?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that sacrifice
  reveals God's **holiness**, sin's **deadliness**, the **inadequacy** of our
  efforts, the **perfection** of Christ the Lamb, and His ultimate
  **worthiness** proven by His death.
- Character Focus Recap: Christ's perfect sacrifice met the **absolute
  standard** of God's law. His perfect character is both our **justification**
  (He covers us) and our **sanctification** (He empowers us to become like Him).
  This transformation is essential preparation.
  - [WB]: {Key Trait: `HOLINESS` / `PERFECTION`}
- Call to Action/Decision: Will we continue offering futile sacrifices of
  self-effort, or will we fully **surrender** to the Worthy Lamb? Will we accept
  His perfect sacrifice not just for forgiveness, but for **character
  transformation**?
  - [WB]: {Call to Action: `"SURRENDER TO THE LAMB"`}
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on the infinite cost paid by the Lamb,
    what area of self-will or known sin will you surrender to His transforming
    power this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The Lamb who was slain now ministers for us in
  the heavenly sanctuary (Heb 7:25), pleading His blood. But soon He returns as
  King. Let us respond to His sacrifice now, allowing Him to perfect His
  character in us, that we may stand ready.
  - [WB]: {Final Hope: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS" (Heb 12:2)`}
