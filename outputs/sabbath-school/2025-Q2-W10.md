## Upon Whom the Ends Have Come

**Overarching Theme:** Learning from the Past: Character Readiness for the Final
Judgment **Central Focus:** Understanding biblical examples of judgment not
merely as history, but as divine case studies revealing God's character, the
pervasive nature of sin, the absolute necessity of **faithfulness leading to
obedience** (character perfection/restoration), and the **urgent need to align
our lives with God's revealed will** in preparation for Christ's return and the
final judgment. **Key Texts:** 1 Corinthians 10:11-12; Genesis 6:5-8; Matthew
24:37-39; Hebrews 11:7; Genesis 18:20-25; Daniel 7:9-10, 22.

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: "History repeats itself," they say. But the Bible tells us certain
  history was recorded specifically _because_ it WILL repeat, especially
  concerning the end of all things. What vital lessons must we grasp _now_?
- Theme Introduction: Today we explore the profound theme: **Learning from the
  Past for Character Readiness.** God didn't just record the Flood or Sodom's
  destruction as ancient history; He preserved them as urgent warnings and
  blueprints for us, "upon whom the ends of the ages have come" (1 Cor 10:11).
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Learning from the Past: Character Readiness
    for Judgment"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: These accounts are not primarily about
  predicting _events_, but about preparing a _people_. They reveal the character
  God requires – a character restored in His image, ready to stand in the final
  judgment and meet Jesus in peace. This is the essence of sanctification.
- Roadmap: We'll examine two key biblical examples – the Flood and Sodom – not
  just for the _what_, but the _why_, understanding the character failures then,
  God's response, and the direct parallels demanding our attention today,
  culminating in the reality of the final judgment.

### II. Heeding the Warning: Lessons from the Flood (Approx 15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The Flood wasn't a sudden whim of God. It was a
  response to a world saturated in sin, offering profound warnings about
  spiritual complacency and the nature of true, saving faith.

#### A. The Condition: A World Drowning in Sin (Gen 6, Matt 24) (Est. 6-7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 6:5, 11-12 "Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually... The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth."
        -   Reading/Context: God's own assessment before the Flood. This wasn't isolated sin, but pervasive, deep-seated corruption of thought and action.
        -   [WB]: Gen 6:5 -> "Wickedness GREAT... heart ONLY EVIL continually"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Sin wasn't just outward acts, but the very *imagination* and *intent* of the heart. It grieved God (v. 6). This reveals the depth of sin God sees and the standard He holds – the thoughts and intents of the heart.
        -   [EGW]: "The sins that called for vengeance upon the antediluvian world exist today. The fear of God is banished from the hearts of men, and His law is treated with indifference and contempt. The intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the generation now living." (PP 101).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "Sins... exist today" / "Worldliness equaled"
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Reflection):* "Genesis 6:5 mentions the 'thoughts' and 'intent' of the heart. Why is this inner condition so serious to God, perhaps even more than outward actions alone?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Matthew 24:37-39 "But as the days of Noah were, so also will the Kcoming of the Son of Man be. For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
        -   Reading/Connection: Jesus directly links Noah's time to the time before His return. The danger wasn't necessarily the activities themselves, but the *spirit* behind them.
        -   [WB]: Matt 24:38-39 -> "Eating, drinking, marrying... DID NOT KNOW"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: They were preoccupied with normal life, *oblivious* to the spiritual reality and impending judgment, despite Noah's preaching. The character need highlighted is **watchfulness**, spiritual discernment, and prioritizing eternal realities over temporal absorption.
        -   [EGW]: "God did not condemn the antediluvians for eating and drinking... Their sin consisted in taking these gifts without gratitude to the Giver, and debasing themselves by indulging appetite without restraint." (PP 101).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Jesus mentions everyday activities like eating, drinking, and marrying. How can these normal parts of life become dangerous distractions that make us unprepared, like those in Noah's day?"

#### B. The Response: Faith That Works (Heb 11:7, 1 Cor 10:11-12) (Est. 8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 11:7 "By faith Noah, being divinely warned of things not yet seen, moved with godly fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his household, by which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."
        -   Reading/Context: Contrasting the world's unbelief with Noah's response.
        -   [WB]: Heb 11:7 -> Faith -> Warned -> Feared -> Prepared (Acted)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: True faith isn't passive belief; it responds to God's Word. Noah heard, believed (even what seemed impossible), revered God ("godly fear"), and **acted** decisively for 120 years. His actions were the evidence of his faith and condemned the world's inaction. This is righteousness by faith in action.
        -   [EGW]: "While Noah was giving his warning message to the world, his works testified of his sincerity. It was thus that his faith was perfected and made evident. He gave the world an example of believing just what God says. All that he possessed, he invested in the ark." (PP 95).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "Works testified sincerity" / "Faith perfected"
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Hebrews 11:7 says Noah 'moved with godly fear.' How is 'godly fear' different from being simply scared? How did it motivate Noah's character and actions?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine someone receiving a certified letter warning their house foundation is cracked and unsafe. One person reads it, worries briefly, then puts it aside, continuing life as usual. Another reads it, hires engineers, and immediately begins costly, difficult repairs based on the warning. Noah was the second person. His faith wasn't just mental agreement; it was life-altering obedience based on God's Word.
        -   Connecting to Life: We have received God's warnings in His Word about the coming storm. Are we merely acknowledging them, or are we, like Noah, allowing that Word to transform our priorities, investments, and daily actions, building the 'ark' of character?
    -   **Foundation Text 4 (Memory Text):** 1 Corinthians 10:11-12 "Now all these things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall."
        -   Reading/Challenge: Paul's direct application. These aren't just stories; they are **our** warnings. Complacency is deadly.
        -   [WB]: 1 Cor 10:12 -> "THINK you stand? TAKE HEED!"
        -   Practical Step: The lesson from Noah is **vigilant faithfulness**. We must actively cultivate a relationship with God where His Word shapes our lives, guarding against the subtle encroachment of worldliness and unbelief that characterized Noah's generation. This requires daily surrender and dependence on the Holy Spirit.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Considering Noah's example and Paul's warning in 1 Cor 10:12, what specific area of 'worldliness' or 'unbelief' (perhaps subtle) do we need to 'take heed' of in our own lives or church community today?"

### III. Understanding God's Judgment: Lessons from Sodom & the Heavenly Court (Approx 15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Sodom's destruction and the glimpse into the
  heavenly judgment in Daniel reveal crucial truths about God's justice, His
  investigative process, and the ultimate basis upon which destinies are decided
  – character aligned with Christ.

#### A. Investigation and Intercession (Gen 18, Ezek 16) (Est. 7-8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 18:20-21, 23-25 "And the LORD said, 'Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grave, I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry against it that has come to Me; and if not, I will know.' ... Then Abraham came near and said, 'Would You also destroy the righteous with the wicked? ... Far be it from You to do such a thing... Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?'"
        -   Reading/Context: God reveals His plan to investigate Sodom to Abraham, prompting Abraham's intercession.
        -   [WB]: Gen 18:21 -> "Go down... SEE... KNOW" (Investigation)
        -   [WB]: Gen 18:25 -> "Shall not the Judge... do RIGHT?" (Justice)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God doesn't act impulsively. He investigates ("go down and see"). This foreshadows the investigative judgment. Abraham's plea appeals to God's own character – His justice. God honors this appeal, showing His mercy is intertwined with His justice.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What does God's statement 'I will go down now and see' (Gen 18:21) reveal about His approach to judgment, even when the outcry is already great?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Ezekiel 16:49-50 "Look, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughter had pride, fullness of food, and abundance of idleness; neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty and committed abomination before Me; therefore I took them away as I saw fit."
        -   Reading/Connection: Ezekiel clarifies Sodom's core sins – not just the commonly cited one, but pride, materialism, indifference to suffering, and haughtiness against God.
        -   [WB]: Ezek 16:49 -> Sins: Pride, Fullness, Idleness, Neglect of Poor
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This paints a picture of self-absorbed prosperity leading to moral decay and disregard for others and God. The character needs highlighted are **humility, compassion, diligence, and active concern for the needy**, reflecting God's own character.
        -   [EGW]: "Love for perishing souls inspired Abraham's prayer. While he loathed the sins of that corrupt city, he desired that the sinners might be saved. His deep interest for Sodom shows the anxiety that we should feel for the impenitent. We should cherish hatred of sin, but pity and love for the sinner." (PP 140).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Ezekiel 16:49 lists sins like 'pride' and 'abundance of idleness.' How might these seemingly 'lesser' sins contribute to the kind of societal collapse seen in Sodom, and how do they challenge our character today?"

#### B. The Court Opens: Judgment and Vindication (Dan 7, Rev 6) (Est. 8-10 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Daniel 7:9-10 "I watched till thrones were put in place, And the Ancient of Days was seated... His throne was a fiery flame... A fiery stream issued And came forth from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to Him; Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, And the books were opened."
        -   Reading/Context: Daniel's vision of the pre-Advent judgment scene in heaven.
        -   [WB]: Dan 7:9-10 -> Ancient of Days -> Court Seated -> Books Opened
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This isn't about God finding out information; it's a formal, open process before the universe. The "books" contain the record of lives (GC 480). This judgment vindicates God's character and determines who is prepared for His kingdom based on their relationship with Him and the evidence of their lives (character).
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Daniel 7:22 "...until the Ancient of Days came, and a judgment was made in favor of the saints of the Most High, and the time came for the saints to possess the kingdom."
        -   Reading/Connection: The outcome for the faithful.
        -   [WB]: Dan 7:22 -> Judgment IN FAVOR of Saints
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The judgment isn't something for the saints to fear *if* they are abiding in Christ. It results in their favor because their Advocate, Jesus, presents His righteousness on their behalf (GC 484). The character need is **abiding faith in Christ**, whose perfect life covers our confessed sins and empowers our obedience.
        -   [EGW]: "While Jesus is pleading for the subjects of His grace, Satan accuses them before God as transgressors... Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and faith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, He lifts His wounded hands before the Father..." (GC 484).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "Jesus pleads... Satan accuses... Christ's righteousness"
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection/Application):* "Knowing that the 'books are opened' (Dan 7:10) and judgment is 'in favor of the saints' (Dan 7:22) through Christ, how should this reality shape our daily priorities and our approach to overcoming sin?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a final exam. One student ignored the syllabus, skipped classes, and walks in terrified. Another studied diligently, attended tutorials, and trusts the teacher's promise to grade fairly based on the syllabus studied; they enter with confidence, not in their perfection, but in their preparation and the teacher's fairness. The judgment is like that final exam based on the 'syllabus' of God's Word and character, with Christ as our Tutor and Advocate.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Revelation 6:15-17 "And the kings of the earth, the great men, the rich men, the commanders, the mighty men, every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains, and said to the mountains and rocks, 'Fall on us and hide us from the face of Him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb! For the great day of His wrath has come, and who is able to stand?'"
        -   Reading/Challenge: The terrifying outcome for those unprepared, who rejected the Lamb's mercy and now face His just wrath. Their character is unfit for His presence.
        -   [WB]: Rev 6:17 -> "Who is able to STAND?"
        -   Practical Step: The contrast is stark. Preparation involves developing a character that loves righteousness and hates sin, a character formed through daily connection with Christ, allowing His righteousness to be imputed *and* imparted. The question "Who is able to stand?" finds its answer only in those clothed in Christ's righteousness.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Revelation 6 shows people terrified of the Lamb they rejected. What practical steps can we take *this week* to ensure we are cultivating a relationship with the Lamb, so His coming is our hope, not our terror?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture (Noah, Sodom,
  Daniel) that God warns before judgment, He investigates justly, He is grieved
  by sin (especially pride, worldliness, neglect), and He calls for a faith that
  actively obeys and transforms character.
- Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** call is clear: develop characters
  fit for heaven – characters reflecting Jesus, marked by faithfulness,
  humility, compassion, and obedience, made possible **only** through His grace
  and power. This is the preparation needed "upon whom the ends of the ages have
  come."
  - [WB]: Key Character Traits: `FAITHFULNESS`, `HUMILITY`, `OBEDIENCE`,
    `WATCHFULNESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: Based on these solemn **biblical** warnings and the
  reality of the judgment, let us "take heed." Let's examine our hearts. Are we
  building on the Rock, Christ, allowing Him to perfect our characters? Or are
  we drifting with the currents of worldliness like those in Noah's day?
  - [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `"TAKE HEED" (1 Cor 10:12)` /
    `"BE READY" (Matt 24:44)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Considering God's desire for our readiness,
    what one aspect of character, highlighted by today's study, will you
    intentionally ask God to develop in you through His Spirit this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The times demand earnest preparation.
  Indifference is fatal. But the Judge is also our Advocate! [EGW]: "In union
  with Christ they judge the wicked... Then the portion which the wicked must
  suffer is meted out, according to their works..." (HB 382). Let us flee to
  Christ, our only hope, that we may stand accepted in the judgment.
  - [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS" (Heb 12:2)` /
    `Dan 7:22 - Favour!`
