**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "We live in unprecedented times, 'upon whom the ends of the ages have come' (1 Cor 10:11). What does this unique position demand of us?"
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: God's character is being vindicated before the universe through His dealings with humanity, especially in judgment. Simultaneously, He calls His end-time people to reflect His character perfectly. These past judgments are vital lessons.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Character Vindicated, Our Character Perfected)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just about knowing prophecy; it's about **becoming** the people who can stand faithfully through the final crisis and reflect Jesus fully. Our eternal destiny is linked to this preparation.
    -   EGW Insight: "God has a special light in this age of the world, a special message to give...to those upon whom the ends of the world are come." (PT Nov 4, 1886, par. 8).
-   Roadmap: We'll examine lessons from the Flood (Noah) and Sodom, then delve into the Pre-Advent Judgment, focusing on God's justice and our needed response.

### II. The Antediluvian Parallel: Faithfulness Amidst Apostasy (10 mins)
-   **A. The World That Was & The World That Is:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Jesus explicitly compared the days before His return to the days of Noah (Matt 24:37-39). The prevailing conditions – widespread wickedness, disregard for God's law, focus on materialism and pleasure – mirror our times.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 6:5, 11-12 (Earth corrupt, filled with violence, all flesh corrupted); Matt 24:38-39 (Eating, drinking, marrying - normal life oblivious to impending doom).
    -   EGW Insight: "The sins that called for vengeance upon the antediluvian world exist today...The intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the generation now living." (PP 101).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The danger of spiritual apathy and being lulled into conformity with the world's standards, forgetting the urgency of the hour.

-   **B. Noah's Righteousness: Character That Condemns the World:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Noah stood apart not just by preaching, but by **living** a life of faith and obedience ("walked with God," Gen 6:9). His actions (building the ark) were a tangible witness and condemnation of the world's unbelief.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Heb 11:7 (By faith, Noah...prepared an ark...condemned the world...became heir of righteousness).
    -   EGW Insight: "While Noah was giving his warning message to the world, his works testified of his sincerity. It was thus that his faith was perfected and made evident." (PP 95). "By their faith and works they [God's people today] are to condemn the world." (Letter 59, 1901, par. 31).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Fear of ridicule, discouragement from lack of visible results, temptation to compromise for acceptance.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Imagine Noah building that massive ark on dry land, miles from any large body of water. People must have thought him utterly mad! It required **unshakeable faith** in God's specific word against all appearances.
-   *Modern Parable (Hypothetical):* Like someone diligently preparing emergency supplies for a predicted hurricane that weather forecasters keep dismissing, facing mockery but trusting the source of the warning.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* FAITHFULNESS / OBEDIENCE
-   *Diagram:* Noah (Walking with God) -> Ark (Action/Witness) -> World (Condemned)
-   *Verse:* Heb 11:7 / Gen 6:9
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...faith was perfected..." (PP 95)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Matthew 24, what were people doing that showed they were unprepared for the Flood?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it often harder to live faithfully when our efforts seem to produce few visible results, like Noah's preaching for 120 years?"
-   *(Application):* "What's one practical way we can ensure our 'works testify of our sincerity' (PP 95) in our faith this week?"

### III. The Sodom Parallel: Divine Investigation and Moral Clarity (10 mins) [*]
-   **A. When Sin Becomes Brazen:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Sodom represents open, defiant sin and societal degradation (Ezek 16:49-50 - pride, fullness of bread, abundance of idleness, neglecting the poor). God doesn't act impulsively; He investigates thoroughly.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 18:20-21 (God goes down to "see" if the outcry is true); Jude 7 (Example of suffering vengeance of eternal fire).
    -   EGW Insight: "The uncontrolled indulgence...that existed...as in Sodom and Gomorrah...will again exist, with intensity of evil, before His second coming." (DA 122).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Need for moral clarity, hatred of sin, but also **pity and love** for the sinner, mirroring Abraham's intercession (Gen 18).

-   **B. The Judge of All the Earth Doing Right:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Abraham's dialogue with God (Gen 18:23-32) reveals God's justice and mercy. God welcomes scrutiny of His character. His judgments are never arbitrary but are based on righteousness and truth. This foreshadows the larger judgment.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 18:25 ("Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?").
    -   EGW Insight: "Love for perishing souls inspired Abraham's prayer. While he loathed the sins of that corrupt city, he desired that the sinners might be saved...We should cherish hatred of sin, but pity and love for the sinner." (PP 140).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Understanding God's justice builds trust in Him, especially as final events unfold. It calls us to reflect His fairness and compassion, separating from sin without condemning sinners.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Visual Metaphor:* Like a thick, spiritual "smog" that settled over Sodom, blinding people to their true condition and the coming danger. We must guard against the smog of modern worldliness.
-   *Analogy:* Abraham acted like a watchman on the walls, pleading for the city. God invites us to understand His ways, not follow blindly. He opens His reasoning to us.

-   *Verse:* Gen 18:25 / Ezek 16:49-50
-   *Question:* Hating Sin vs. Loving Sinner?

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What question did Abraham ask God that highlights God's character in judgment? (Gen 18:25)"
-   *(Reflection):* "How can we cultivate both a hatred for sin (like God has) and a deep compassion for sinners (like Abraham and Christ showed)?"
-   *(Application):* "What practical steps can we take to avoid the 'spiritual smog' of worldliness mentioned in the illustration?"

### IV. The Heavenly Tribunal: Vindicating God and His People (10-12 mins)
-   **A. The Judgment is Set, The Books Are Opened:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Daniel 7 depicts a solemn, pre-Advent judgment scene in heaven. This isn't primarily for God's information, but for the vindication of His character and His dealings with humanity before the watching universe (angels, etc.). Records are examined.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 7:9-10 ("Thrones were put in place...Ancient of Days...judgment was set, books were opened"); Rev 14:7 ("Hour of His judgment has come").
    -   EGW Insight: "The books of record in heaven...are to determine the decisions of the judgment...the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.” (GC 480). This judgment vindicates God's justice. (cf. HB 382).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Misconceptions about judgment as merely punitive; understanding its **vindicative** purpose for God's righteousness.

-   **B. Our Advocate and Our Only Hope:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: In this solemn court scene, our only hope is Jesus, the Son of Man (Dan 7:13), our Advocate. He doesn't excuse our sins but presents His perfect righteousness and atoning blood on behalf of the truly penitent and faithful. The verdict is "in favor of the saints" (Dan 7:22) because of Him.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 7:13-14, 22; 1 John 2:1 ("We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous").
    -   EGW Insight: "Jesus does not excuse their sins, but shows their penitence and faith, and, claiming for them forgiveness, He lifts His wounded hands before the Father..." (GC 484). "Jesus, our Advocate, presents an effectual plea in behalf of all who by repentance and faith have committed the keeping of their souls to Him...by the mighty arguments of Calvary, vanquishes their accuser." (PK 586).
    -   Application/Character Perfection Link: This understanding fuels our desire for sanctification – not to *earn* salvation, but to *reflect* the character of the One who saves us and vindicates us in judgment. It calls for **total reliance** on Christ.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A cosmic courtroom scene, but unlike human courts, the Judge's own character and law are also being examined and vindicated before all creation.
-   *Visual Metaphor:* Like a divine X-ray, the judgment reveals not just actions but the hidden motives and thoughts of the heart, showing the depth of sin and the power of Christ's transformation.

-   *Verse:* Dan 7:10, 22 / 1 John 2:1
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...lifts His wounded hands..." (GC 484)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "Who appears before the Ancient of Days in Daniel 7, representing humanity?" (The Son of Man)
-   *(Reflection):* "How does understanding the judgment as a vindication of *God's* character, not just a judgment of us, change our perspective on it?"
-   *(Application):* "Knowing Christ is our Advocate, how should this impact our daily struggle with sin and our pursuit of His character?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Reiterate core takeaways: Past judgments (Flood, Sodom) are urgent warnings for us. God's justice is perfect, and His character will be vindicated. The pre-Advent judgment is real. Our only hope is Christ, our Advocate.
-   Character Focus Recap: God calls us, living at the very end of time, to reflect His character of righteousness, faithfulness, and love, made possible **only** through connection with Christ. This is the essence of readiness.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: CHRISTLIKENESS)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Let us heed the admonition: "let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall" (1 Cor 10:12). Let's examine our lives, confess our sins, and fully surrender to Christ, allowing Him to perfect His character in us daily.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SURRENDER / PREPARE)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What one area of your life will you intentionally surrender to Christ's transforming power this week, preparing to meet Him?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The time is short. Let us live with eternity in view, embracing the high calling.
    -   EGW Insight: "His word will be to them a light shining amid the moral darkness. They will obey the words, 'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.'" (RH Apr 16, 1901, par. 17).
