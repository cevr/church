**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "Why does God speak in symbols and prophecies? Is it to confuse us, or is there a deeper, urgent purpose, especially for us living today?"
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: God isn't hiding truth; He's urgently calling us to understand His prophetic word, not just for information, but for transformation and readiness.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God's Urgent Message: Understanding Prophecy for Readiness)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Link understanding prophecy directly to knowing God (Jer 9:24), developing Christlike character, and being prepared for Jesus' soon return. This isn't academic; it's about salvation and sanctification.
    -   "The study of the Revelation directs the mind to the prophecies of Daniel, and both present most important instruction... concerning events to take place at the close of this world's history." (GC 341.2)
-   Roadmap: Briefly outline: 1) God *wants* us to understand, 2) Prophecy is *unsealed* for our time, 3) The *right approach* is crucial, 4) The goal is *character readiness*.

### II. God *Intends* Us to Understand (10 mins)
-   **A. The Myth of Incomprehensibility:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Counter the idea that prophecy (esp. Daniel/Revelation) is sealed or too complex. God *desires* communication and understanding.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 1:1-3 (Revelation = unveiling; blessing promised to readers/hearers); Matt 24:15 ("let the reader understand"). God doesn't speak in vain.
    -   EGW Insight: "Christ the Revelator, foreseeing the warfare that would be waged against the study of the Revelation, pronounced a blessing upon all who should read, hear, and observe the words of the prophecy." (GC 342.1). Also: "The very name 'Revelation' contradicts the statement that it is a sealed book." (TM 113.2)
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Overcoming discouragement or apathy towards studying prophecy due to perceived difficulty or past confusion.

-   **B. Understanding Requires the Right Heart:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: While God makes truth accessible, understanding isn't merely intellectual; it requires humility, dependence on the Holy Spirit, and a surrendered heart.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Matt 11:25 (revealed to babes); John 16:13 (Spirit guides into truth); Ps 139:1-6 (God knows us fully, we can't grasp Him fully, but He reveals what's needed).
    -   EGW Insight: "The Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity... while to the humble and uncultured also it makes plain the way of life... Not one trembling seeker need fail of walking in pure and holy light." (Ed 170.1).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Pride, preconceived ideas, neglecting prayer for the Spirit's guidance, "looking for loopholes" instead of truth.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A loving Father writes a detailed letter with instructions and warnings for his children about to embark on a dangerous journey. He *wants* them to read and understand it for their safety.
-   *Hypothetical:* Imagine receiving an urgent, coded message about impending danger. Would you dismiss it as too hard, or seek every means to decode it? Prophecy is God's urgent message.

-   *Verse:* Rev 1:3 (Blessing!) / Matt 24:15 (Understand!)
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...a blessing upon all who should read, hear, and observe..." (GC 342.1)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "What does the very name 'Revelation' tell us about God's intention for that book?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is a humble heart more important than a high IQ when it comes to understanding God's Word, especially prophecy?"
-   *(Application):* "What's one attitude adjustment we might need to make to approach prophecy with a heart ready to be taught by the Spirit?"

### III. Prophecy Unsealed for the End Time (10 mins)
-   **A. Daniel's Sealed Book Opened:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Daniel was told to seal parts of his prophecy "until the time of the end." We are *living* in that time, meaning the prophecies are now open for understanding.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 12:4 ("shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end"); Dan 12:9-10 ("words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end... the wise shall understand"). Contrast Rev 22:10 ("Seal not the sayings... for the time is at hand").
    -   EGW Insight: "'The wise shall understand' (verse 10), was spoken of the visions of Daniel that were to be unsealed in the latter days..." (PK 547.4). Also: "The truths of this book [Revelation] are addressed to those living in these last days. We are standing with the veil removed in the holy place..." (TM 113.2).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Develops **diligence** and **faithfulness** in study, recognizing the special privilege and responsibility of living when these truths are clear.

-   **B. Increased Knowledge = Increased Responsibility:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The "increase of knowledge" (Dan 12:4) specifically includes understanding Daniel's prophecies, fulfilled by the Advent movement and ongoing light. This knowledge isn't just for knowing, but for living and warning.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Dan 12:4 ("many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased"). Context points to prophetic knowledge. Amos 3:7 ("Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets").
    -   EGW Insight: "As we near the close of this world's history, the prophecies recorded by Daniel demand our special attention, as they relate to the very time in which we are living." (PK 547.3).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Understanding prophecy correctly anchors our faith amidst end-time deceptions and motivates urgent preparation and sharing of the Three Angels' Messages. It builds **steadfastness**.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Like finding an old treasure map where the final clues only become clear when you reach a specific landmark ("the time of the end"). We've reached the landmark!
-   *Metaphor:* God gave Daniel the "locked box" of prophecy; He gave John (Revelation) and the Holy Spirit in the last days the "keys" to open it.

-   *Diagram:* Scroll (Daniel) Sealed -> Clock pointing near 12 -> Scroll Unsealed (Rev/Daniel)
-   *Verse:* Dan 12:4, 10 / Rev 22:10
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...demand our special attention..." (PK 547.3)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Daniel 12, who would understand the prophecies in the time of the end?" (The wise)
-   *(Reflection):* "How does knowing that we live in the 'time of the end' change the way we should view the books of Daniel and Revelation?"
-   *(Application):* "If this knowledge is unsealed for us, what responsibility does that place on us personally?"

### IV. The Right Approach: Letting Scripture Interpret Scripture (10 mins) [*]
-   **A. Scripture, Its Own Interpreter:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The safest way to understand prophecy (and all Scripture) is to let the Bible define its own terms and symbols, comparing scripture with scripture. Avoid imposing outside ideas or current events onto the text initially.
    -   Biblical Foundation: 2 Pet 1:20 ("no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation"); Isa 28:10 ("precept upon precept... line upon line"); Luke 24:27 (Jesus expounded Scripture using Scripture).
    -   EGW Insight: "Scripture must be its own expositor, since it is a rule of itself... If I depend on a teacher to expound to me... then his guessing, desire, creed, or wisdom is my rule, and not the Bible." (ARSH Nov 25, 1884, par. 24 - Miller's Rule #5). Also: "The Bible is its own interpreter. With beautiful simplicity, one portion connects itself with the truth of another portion, until the whole Bible is blended in one harmonious whole." (ARSH Aug 13, 1959, par. 5).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Resisting the temptation of sensationalist interpretations, date-setting, or forcing symbols to fit current headlines without clear biblical warrant. Builds **discernment**.

-   **B. Diligence and Prayer Required:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: This method requires patient, prayerful study ("diligent application") not just quick glances or relying on others' conclusions without personal investigation.
    -   Biblical Foundation: 2 Tim 2:15 ("Study to shew thyself approved... rightly dividing the word of truth"); Acts 17:11 (Bereans searched Scriptures daily).
    -   EGW Insight: "[Miller] studied with earnest prayer for divine enlightenment... compared scripture with scripture by the aid of the marginal references and the concordance. He pursued his study in a regular and methodical manner." (GC 320.2).
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Cultivates **patience**, **thoroughness**, and **humility** in study, acknowledging our need for God's help.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Assembling a complex jigsaw puzzle (Wednesday's lesson). You don't force pieces; you look for how they naturally fit together based on the whole picture emerging from the pieces themselves.
-   *Metaphor:* Using the Bible as both the map and the compass. Don't bring in a faulty compass (preconceived ideas, news headlines) to interpret the map.

-   *Diagram:* Bible <-> Bible (Arrows showing comparison)
-   *Verse:* 2 Tim 2:15 / Acts 17:11
-   *Rule:* Miller's Rule #5 (Bible its own expositor)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "What did the Bereans do that made them 'more noble'?" (Searched the Scriptures daily to check what they heard).
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it sometimes tempting to jump to conclusions about prophecy based on current events instead of carefully letting the Bible explain itself?"
-   *(Application):* "What is one practical step you can take this week to practice 'comparing scripture with scripture' in your personal study?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Reiterate core deep takeaways: God *wants* us to understand prophecy, it's *unsealed* for our time, the *Bible itself* is the key, and the ultimate purpose is knowing God and **character readiness**.
-   Character Focus Recap: Emphasize that understanding prophecy isn't an end in itself. It's meant to deepen our awe of God, solidify our faith, purify our lives, and prepare a people to meet Jesus. It builds **faithfulness** and **holiness**.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFULNESS / READINESS)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Challenge class to commit to *personally* and *prayerfully* studying Daniel and Revelation, using the principle of Scripture interpreting Scripture. Don't rely solely on others. Ask God for wisdom and a teachable heart.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: STUDY / PRAY / OBEY)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Seeing the importance God places on understanding these messages for our time, what one step will you take this week to engage more deeply with His prophetic Word?" (Rhetorical)
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: End with Rev 1:3 ("Blessed is he that readeth...") and the assurance that God gives wisdom to those who ask (James 1:5). Connect understanding to the urgency of the hour and the glorious hope of Christ's return.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 1:3 / "Be Ready!")*
