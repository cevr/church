## Some Principles of Prophecy

**Overarching Theme:** Knowing God Himself Through His Revealed Word, Especially
Prophecy **Central Focus:** Understanding prophecy not merely as prediction, but
as God's intentional self-revelation designed to restore His image in us,
transform our character, and prepare us for eternity. **Key Texts:** Jeremiah
9:24, Matthew 24:15, Daniel 12:4, 9-10, 2 Timothy 3:15-17

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Have you ever felt confused or even intimidated by Bible prophecy? Many
  do. Some see it as a sealed code, others argue endlessly over details. But
  what if the primary purpose isn't just predicting dates, but revealing
  Someone?
- Theme Introduction: Today, we'll explore a **profound** truth: Prophecy is one
  of God's primary ways of inviting us to **know Him** – His character, His
  love, His plan, His power. Understanding prophecy correctly leads to
  understanding God more deeply.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Knowing God Through Prophecy"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This knowledge isn't just academic. Jeremiah
  9:24 says true glory is in knowing the Lord who exercises lovingkindness,
  judgment, and righteousness. This knowledge is meant to **transform us**,
  restoring His character in us, making us ready for His soon return. It's
  central to our sanctification.
- Roadmap: We will look first at God's **desire** for us to understand Him
  through His Word, then explore the **method** He provides for studying
  prophecy diligently and safely, leading to true knowledge and character
  transformation.

### II. God's Intent: He Desires to Be Known (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Contrary to popular belief, God isn't trying to
  hide truth in obscure riddles. His deepest desire, revealed in Scripture, is
  for us to understand Him and His plan.

#### A. The Divine Invitation to Understand ({Est. 8-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Jeremiah 9:24
        -   Reading/Context: Read the verse. Context is God correcting misplaced pride (wisdom, might, riches).
        -   [WB]: Jer 9:24 / "Know Me"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God says the *only* valid boasting is understanding and knowing Him – His character attributes: lovingkindness, judgment, righteousness. Prophecy powerfully reveals these aspects of God in action throughout history and into the future.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "According to Jeremiah 9:24, what is the one thing God says we *should* glory in?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Matthew 24:15
        -   Reading/Connection: Jesus, speaking of Daniel's prophecy, explicitly says, "Whoso readeth, let him understand." This connects directly to prophecy.
        -   [WB]: Matt 24:15 -> "Let him UNDERSTAND"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Jesus assumes understanding is possible and necessary, especially regarding end-time prophecies. This requires more than casual reading; it demands engagement and a desire to grasp God's message. Our character need is humility and teachability, not assuming it's beyond us.
        -   [EGW]: "Ministers and people declared that the prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation were incomprehensible mysteries. But Christ directed His disciples to the words of the prophet Daniel concerning events to take place in their time, and said: ‘Whoso readeth, let him understand.’ Matthew 24:15." ([GC 341]).
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...let him understand."
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "If Jesus Himself commanded readers of prophecy to 'understand,' how should that affect our attitude towards studying books like Daniel and Revelation?"

#### B. The Blessing and Means of Understanding ({Est. 7-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Revelation 1:3
        -   Reading/Context: The very beginning of Revelation, a book many find confusing.
        -   [WB]: Rev 1:3 / "Blessed" -> Read, Hear, Keep
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God pronounces a specific blessing on those who read, hear, and *keep* (obey/apply) the words of this prophecy. This implies it *can* be understood sufficiently to be applied. The blessing is tied to engagement and obedience, showing prophecy's practical, character-focused purpose.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Psalm 139:1-6
        -   Reading/Connection: David marvels at how intimately God knows him.
        -   [WB]: Psalm 139 / God Knows Us <-> We Can Know God
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: If God, who is infinite, knows us finite beings so perfectly, can He not make Himself known to us in ways we can grasp? His omniscience doesn't create distance; it enables connection. Our need is faith to believe He *can* and *will* reveal Himself to the seeking heart.
        -   [EGW]: "The Bible unfolds truth with a simplicity and an adaptation to the needs and longings of the human heart that has astonished and charmed the most highly cultivated minds, while to the humble and uncultured also it makes plain the way of life." ([Ed 169-170]).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine receiving a detailed letter from a loving Father explaining His plans for your future safety and inheritance. Would you toss it aside saying, "It's probably too complicated"? Or would you pore over it, trusting He wrote it *for you* to understand? Prophecy is like that letter.
        -   Connecting to Life: God intends His prophetic Word to guide, warn, and assure us. Our part is to approach it with trust and a desire to learn, not skepticism or laziness.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Matthew 11:29
        -   Reading/Challenge: Jesus invites us: "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me..."
        -   [WB]: Matt 11:29 / "Learn of Me"
        -   Practical Step: The path to understanding God (through prophecy or any scripture) begins with surrendering to Him, accepting His teaching (yoke), and having a humble spirit ("meek and lowly"). This prepares the heart to receive divine light.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Considering the 'Father's letter' analogy and Matthew 11:29, what's one practical adjustment we can make in our personal Bible study approach this week to better 'learn of Him' through His Word?"

### III. God's Method: Diligent Study Led by the Spirit (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Knowing God desires us to understand, how do we
  approach His prophetic Word correctly? God provides clear principles in
  Scripture itself.

#### A. Unsealing Truth at the Appointed Time ({Est. 7-8 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Daniel 12:4, 9
        -   Reading/Context: Daniel is told to "shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end."
        -   [WB]: Dan 12:4, 9 / Sealed -> "Time of the End"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Some parts of prophecy were intentionally veiled until a specific time. This doesn't mean *all* prophecy was sealed, nor that it's *still* sealed now. It points to God's sovereignty over revelation.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Daniel 12:10
        -   Reading/Connection: Immediately follows the "sealing" instruction. "Many shall be purified... and the wise shall understand; but none of the wicked shall understand."
        -   [WB]: Dan 12:10 / Wise = Understand | Wicked =/= Understand
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Understanding is linked to character ("purified," "wise") and relationship with God. It's not merely intellectual capacity. The "wicked" (those resisting God) remain blind. This highlights the **moral** component of understanding spiritual truth. Our character must be refined by God to receive deeper light.
        -   [EGW]: "As we near the close of this world's history, the prophecies recorded by Daniel demand our special attention, as they relate to the very time in which we are living... Satan has led many to believe that the prophetic portions... cannot be understood. But the promise is plain that special blessing will accompany the study... 'The wise shall understand' (verse 10), was spoken of the visions of Daniel that were to be unsealed in the latter days..." ([PK 547]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Daniel 12:10 connects being 'wise' and 'purified' with understanding prophecy. What does this tell us about the preparation needed to truly grasp God's message?"

#### B. Scripture Interpreting Scripture ({Est. 8-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** 2 Timothy 3:15-17
        -   Reading/Context: Paul reminds Timothy of the power of the Holy Scriptures.
        -   [WB]: 2 Tim 3:15-17 / Scripture -> Wise unto Salvation / Profitable
        -   Unpacking the Truth: All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable. It makes us "wise unto salvation" and equips us for "all good works." This includes prophecy. It's not just for information, but for transformation and equipping – core to character perfection.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Luke 24:27
        -   Reading/Connection: Jesus on the road to Emmaus, explaining Himself.
        -   [WB]: Luke 24:27 / Moses + Prophets -> Christ
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Jesus didn't bring in outside sources. He used Scripture ("Moses and all the prophets") to explain Scripture ("things concerning himself"). This is the divine model: let the Bible interpret itself. Our need is patience and diligence to compare scripture with scripture.
        -   [EGW]: "[William Miller] compared scripture with scripture by the aid of the marginal references and the concordance... He saw that the prophecies, so far as they had been fulfilled, had been fulfilled literally; that all the various figures, metaphors, parables, similitudes, etc., were either explained in their immediate connection, or the terms in which they were expressed were defined in other scriptures..." ([GC 320]).
        -   [WB]: Scripture Interprets Scripture
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Trying to understand prophecy by only looking at current events is like trying to assemble a complex engine using only a picture of the finished car. You need the manufacturer's manual (the whole Bible) which explains what each part (symbol, theme) means and how they fit together according to the Designer's intent.
        -   Connecting to Life: Avoid speculation based on news headlines. Ground interpretation in the Bible's own definitions and context.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Hebrews 4:12
        -   Reading/Challenge: The Word of God is alive, powerful, sharp, discerning thoughts and intents.
        -   [WB]: Heb 4:12 / Living Word -> Discerns Heart
        -   Practical Step: When we study prophecy (or any Scripture) prayerfully, allowing the Bible to interpret itself, the Holy Spirit uses that living Word to examine *us*, revealing our motives, correcting our thinking, and shaping our character. It's an active process of transformation.
        -   [EGW]: "The Bible is its own interpreter. With beautiful simplicity, one portion connects itself with the truth of another portion, until the whole Bible is blended in one harmonious whole." ([ARSH Aug 13, 1959, par. 5]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Thinking about the 'engine manual' analogy and Hebrews 4:12, how can we practically use the principle 'Scripture interprets Scripture' when we encounter a difficult prophetic passage or symbol this week?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that God **intends**
  for us to understand Him through His prophetic Word (Jer 9:24, Matt 24:15, Rev
  1:3). He has provided a **method**: diligent, prayerful study, allowing
  Scripture to interpret Scripture (Luke 24:27, 2 Tim 3:16), recognizing that
  understanding is linked to a purified heart (Dan 12:10).
- Character Focus Recap: The ultimate goal isn't just knowing the future, but
  **knowing God** and being transformed into His likeness. Prophecy reveals His
  character and calls us to holiness, faithfulness, and readiness.
  - [WB]: {Key Character Trait: `FAITHFULNESS` / `READINESS`}
- Call to Action/Decision: Let's commit to studying prophecy not with fear or
  speculation, but with reverence and a deep desire to know God better. Let's
  use the Bible's own keys to unlock its meaning.
  - [WB]: {Call to Action Keyword: `"STUDY"` / `"UNDERSTAND"` / `"KNOW HIM"`}
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's invitation today, what specific
    prophetic portion of Scripture will you prayerfully begin to study this
    week, asking the Spirit to help you understand God better through it?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The prophecies are unsealing because the time is
  short. Understanding them correctly anchors our faith, purifies our character,
  and fills us with hope as we see God's ultimate victory unfolding.
  - [EGW]: "We are nearing the time when the prophecies of the book of
    Revelation are to be fulfilled." ([TM 113]). Let us study, understand, and
    be ready, "looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the
    great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ" (Titus 2:13).
  - [WB]: {Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: `Titus 2:13` / `"BE READY"`}
