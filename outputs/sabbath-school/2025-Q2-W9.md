### I. Introduction: Earth Shakes, God Reigns - Our Eternal Hope (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "We see chaos, uncertainty, nations raging... where is our **true** security? The Psalms, written amid turmoil, point us to the only unshakable reality."
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: God's absolute sovereignty and His plan to establish His eternal kingdom are our anchor in these last days. This isn't just theory; it's the foundation for our preparation.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: God Reigns - Be Ready!)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Understanding God's eternal plan is **CRITICAL** for developing the character needed to stand firm and be ready for His soon return. It shapes *how* we live now.
-   Roadmap: Briefly outline: 1. God as our Refuge, 2. His Refining Work, 3. The Certainty of His Return, 4. Our Role in His Plan.

### II. "Be Still": Finding Refuge in God's Unchanging Sovereignty (Psalm 46) (8-10 mins)
-   **A. God Our Present, Powerful Refuge:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Amidst earthly collapse (v. 2-3, nations raging v. 6), God is not distant; He is our immediate, powerful, **proven** refuge and strength. This isn't wishful thinking; it's divine reality.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 46:1-3, 7, 11 - God is *with us*, a fortress. Contrast earthly instability with God's presence.
    -   EGW Insight: "In all who are under the training of God is to be revealed a life that is not in harmony with the world... When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' Psalm 46:10." (DA 363.2). This stillness builds deep trust.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Feeling overwhelmed by world events or personal trials? The solution isn't ignoring them, but finding **active refuge** in God's sovereign presence through quiet trust and communion.

-   **B. Knowing God Amidst the Storm:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: The command "Be still, and know..." (v. 10) isn't passivity, but a call to cease frantic human effort and **recognize** God's ultimate control and purpose – He *will* be exalted.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 46:10 - Connect "Be still" (Heb. *rapha* - let go, cease striving) with "know" (Heb. *yada* - deep, experiential knowledge) that He is God.
    -   EGW Insight: "O, let the soul break for the longing it has for God. Exercise the faith that will not lose its hold on God... Take hold of God with earnest, persevering faith." (Ltr 96, 1901, par. 13). Stillness leads to active faith-hold.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Obstacles include fear, distraction, self-reliance. Overcome by intentionally choosing moments of quiet reflection on God's power and promises.

-   *Quote Snippet:* "...silence of the soul makes distinct the voice of God." (DA 363.2)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "What specific phrases in Psalm 46 emphasize God's power even when the earth seems to be falling apart?"
-   *(Reflection):* "What does it practically mean for *you* to 'be still' and 'know that He is God' when facing stressful situations?"
-   *(Application):* "How can we intentionally cultivate that 'stillness' this week to better hear God's voice amid the noise of life?"

### III. Forged in the Fire: How God Perfects Character Amid Turmoil (Psalm 75) (8-10 mins)
-   **A. God's Judgment Corrects and Refines:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's judgment (Ps 75:2, 7-8) isn't just punitive; it's **corrective and refining**. He uses trials and exposes sin to humble the proud and lift up the righteous, shaping characters fit for His kingdom.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 75:7-8 (God is judge, puts down one, lifts up another), James 1:2-4 (Trials produce endurance, leading to perfection). Connect God's judgment with His purpose to purify.
    -   EGW Insight: "Every act of obedience to Christ, every act of self-denial for His sake, every trial well endured, every victory gained over temptation, is a step in the march to the glory of final victory." (MB 140.3). Trials are **steps**, not setbacks.
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Trials test and develop **humility, patience, endurance, faith, dependence on God** – essential traits for the final generation.

-   **B. Cooperating with the Divine Refiner:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: We must choose to **cooperate** with God's refining process, submitting to His will even when it's difficult, trusting His ultimate purpose for our sanctification.
    -   Biblical Foundation: 1 Peter 1:6-7 (Trials test genuineness of faith, like gold refined by fire). Zephaniah 1:14 (Day of the Lord is near - urgency for readiness).
    -   EGW Insight: "God brings us into trials in order that we may be drawn nearer to Him... In his life two powers struggled for the mastery. Unbelief marshaled its forces... Day by day the battle went on... But in the end, faith conquered..." (ST Aug 11, 1909, par. 9). It's a battle, requiring our cooperation through faith.
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: This refining is **essential preparation** for the time of trouble and standing without an intercessor. It builds the character that reflects Christ fully.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Visual Metaphor:* God is the Master Goldsmith, using the fires of affliction not to destroy us, but to burn away the dross (sin, selfishness) and reveal the pure gold of Christlike character.
-   *Analogy:* Like an athlete enduring rigorous training to win the prize, we endure spiritual discipline and trials to be fit for God's eternal kingdom.

-   *Verse:* James 1:2-4 / 1 Pet 1:7
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...a step in the march to... final victory." (MB 140.3)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What metaphor did we use to describe how God uses trials to purify our character? (Goldsmith/Fire)"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it often hard to see trials as opportunities for growth rather than just burdens? What helps change that perspective?"
-   *(Application):* "Thinking about 'cooperating with the Refiner,' what specific attitude or action can we practice when facing difficulties this week?"

### IV. His Feet Shall Stand: The Literal Return and Everlasting Kingdom (Zech 14, 1 Thess 4, Ps 47) (7-9 mins)
-   **A. The Certainty of Christ's Literal, Visible Return:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The Bible is unequivocally clear: Christ is returning **literally, visibly, and victoriously** to establish His eternal kingdom. This is not a metaphor, but the blessed hope.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Zechariah 14:4, 9 ("His feet shall stand... upon the Mount of Olives," "LORD shall be King over all the earth"); 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17 (Lord descends, shout, trumpet, dead rise, caught up). Emphasize the physical reality described.
    -   EGW Insight: "Christ descends upon the Mount of Olives... 'And His feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives...' 'And the Lord shall be King over all the earth...' As the New Jerusalem... comes down... Christ, with His people and the angels, enters the Holy City." (GC 662.2). This is a literal, tangible event.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Counteracts vague, spiritualized views of the kingdom. Provides concrete hope and motivation for readiness.

-   **B. A Kingdom Not of This World, Established at His Coming:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Christ's **kingdom of glory** is established *at* His Second Coming, replacing all earthly kingdoms (Ps 47:1-4, 8). It is fundamentally different from the temporary, flawed systems of this world.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 47:1-4, 8 (God reigns over nations, subdues peoples under *His* feet); Daniel 2:44 (God sets up a kingdom that shall never be destroyed). Contrast with current world powers.
    -   EGW Insight: "Until that time [final judgment] the kingdom of Christ cannot be established on the earth. His kingdom is not of this world... 'Our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour...'" (PP 763.2, citing Phil 3:20). Kingdom of grace now, kingdom of glory then.
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Danger of placing ultimate hope in earthly solutions or becoming discouraged by world conditions. Focus must remain on the coming eternal kingdom.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* We are like ambassadors in a foreign land, faithfully representing our King while eagerly awaiting His arrival to establish His rightful, permanent rule.
-   *Metaphor:* Building our lives on the shifting sands of this world vs. building on the solid Rock of Christ's promises and His coming kingdom.

-   *Quote Snippet:* "...His feet shall stand..." (GC 662.2) / "...not of this world." (PP 763.2)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to Zechariah 14, what specific place will Christ's feet touch when He returns?"
-   *(Reflection):* "How does focusing on the *literal* return of Christ and His eternal kingdom impact how we view current world events and our priorities?"
-   *(Application):* "Knowing our true citizenship is in heaven (Phil 3:20), what's one 'earthly entanglement' we might need to loosen our grip on this week?"

### V. Reflecting His Glory: Our Role in Earth's Final Hour (Ps 67, Rev 14) (7-9 mins) [*]
-   **A. Shining God's Light to a Dark World:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: As recipients of God's grace ("God be merciful... cause His face to shine upon us," Ps 67:1), we have a sacred duty to **reflect His character and make His salvation known** to all nations (Ps 67:2).
    -   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 67:1-2; Matthew 5:16 ("Let your light so shine..."). Connect God's blessing *to* us with our mission *for* Him.
    -   EGW Insight: "God has given you precious privileges... let others share your mercies... The children of God are called upon to show forth the praises of him who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light; for they are to be Christ's representatives." (ST Feb 3, 1890, par. 5). Our lives are the sermon.
    -   Application/Need Tackled: Addresses complacency. We are not just waiting; we are actively participating in God's final work through witness and character.

-   **B. Embodying the Final Message:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: The final message (Rev 14:6-12) culminates in identifying a people who **keep God's commandments and have the faith of Jesus** (Rev 14:12). Our character *is* part of the message.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Revelation 14:6-12 - The everlasting gospel goes forth, calling for worship of the Creator and warning against compromise, defining the character of the saints.
    -   EGW Insight: "Thus the message of the third angel will be proclaimed. As the time comes for it to be given with greatest power, the Lord will work through humble instruments, leading the minds of those who consecrate themselves to His service... The words which the Lord gave them they uttered, fearless of consequences..." (GC 606.2). Character (consecration) empowers the message.
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Our daily choices in obedience and faith are preparing us to stand and are a vital part of God's final appeal to the world.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Visual Metaphor:* Like the moon reflecting the sun's light, we don't generate our own light but are called to reflect the glorious light of Christ's character to a world in darkness.
-   *Analogy:* A trumpet must give a clear, distinct sound to be effective. Our lives must give a clear, consistent testimony of God's truth and love.

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Psalm 67, *why* should God's face shine upon us? (So His way/salvation may be known)."
-   *(Reflection):* "In what ways does our daily character either help or hinder our mission to reflect Christ and share His message?"
-   *(Application):* "What is one practical way you can 'let your light shine' this week in your specific sphere of influence (home, work, community)?"

### VI. Conclusion & Appeal: Heirs of the Kingdom - Our Response Today (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Reiterate core takeaways simply: God **IS** sovereign over all chaos (Ps 46). He **IS** refining our character for eternity (Ps 75). Christ **IS** returning literally to establish His kingdom (Zech 14). We **ARE** called to reflect Him and share this hope (Ps 67, Rev 14).

    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFULNESS / PATIENCE)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: "Knowing these profound truths, how will we respond? Will we 'be still' and trust Him? Cooperate with His refining? Live as citizens of the coming kingdom? Reflect His light?" Challenge: Choose one area this week for deeper surrender and reliance on His power.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: SURRENDER / TRUST / REFLECT)*
