**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Look at the headlines – chaos, uncertainty, fear seem to reign. Yet, the
  Psalms, written thousands of years ago, speak directly to our time, offering
  not just comfort, but profound truth about **who** is truly in control.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we delve deep into the Psalms to uncover the
  **profound** reality of God's absolute sovereignty, even when the earth
  trembles. We'll see how understanding this **scriptural depth** is vital for
  our stability and preparation now.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "God's Unshakable Kingdom & Our Place"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about
  transformation. God allows trials to refine us, to restore His image within us
  (character perfection), making us fit citizens for His soon-coming, eternal
  kingdom. Our response to turmoil reveals our readiness.
- Roadmap: We will explore (1) God as our refuge in final conflicts (Ps 46), (2)
  His righteous judgment establishing His kingdom (Ps 75, 47), and (3) Our vital
  role in reflecting His character and mission (Ps 67).

### II. God Our Refuge Amidst Earth's Final Convulsions (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Psalm 46 paints a picture of extreme upheaval,
  mirroring prophecies of the last days. Where is our safety found?

#### A. Finding Stability When the World Shakes ({Est. Time: 6-7 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Psalm 46:1-3
        -   Reading/Context: Read verses. The psalmist describes cosmic-level chaos – mountains falling into the sea! This isn't just poetic; it echoes end-time descriptions (cf. Rev 6:14).
        -   [WB]: Psalm 46:1 `GOD is our REFUGE`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Our security isn't in earthly stability (which will fail), but in God Himself – our **refuge**, **strength**, and **very present help**. This is a statement of **fact**, not just feeling.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What three specific assurances does Psalm 46:1 give us about God in times of trouble?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Jeremiah 4:23-26
        -   Reading/Connection: Read verses. Jeremiah sees a vision of the earth "without form and void" – a de-creation, the result of sin and judgment. This links the Psalmist's imagery to the consequences of rebellion against God's sovereignty.
        -   [WB]: Jer 4:23 `Without form & void` -> Ps 46:2-3 `Earth removed`
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The turmoil isn't random; it's often the consequence of turning from God. Our greatest need in such times isn't just physical safety, but spiritual stability rooted in **trusting** God's character and control, even when everything seems to be falling apart.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does knowing that God remains our refuge, even when facing the ultimate consequences described in Jeremiah, impact your view of current world events?"

#### B. The Call to Stillness and Divine Exaltation ({Est. Time: 4-5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Psalm 46:10
        -   Reading/Context: After describing chaos and God's power (vv. 6-9), the command comes: "Be still..."
        -   [WB]: Psalm 46:10 `BE STILL & KNOW` -> `I AM GOD`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This isn't passive resignation. It's a call to cease striving in our own strength, to quiet the soul, and to **actively recognize** God's supreme authority and power. It's in this stillness we truly *know* Him.
        -   [EGW]: "When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of God. He bids us, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' Psalm 46:10. Here alone can true rest be found. And this is the effectual preparation for all who labor for God." ([DA 363.2]).
        -   [WB]: EGW: `Silence of the soul -> distinct voice of God`
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine trying to hear a whisper during a rock concert versus in a quiet library. We must intentionally create that inner quietness to hear God amidst life's noise and fear.
        -   Practical Step & Character Focus: Stillness requires **faith** and **humility**. It means consciously choosing to trust God's sovereignty over our fears and plans. This builds a character that relies wholly on Him, essential for the final crisis.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What practical steps can we take this week to 'be still' and intentionally listen for God's voice amidst our busy or troubled lives?"

### III. God's Righteous Judgment and Everlasting Kingdom (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The turmoil described earlier isn't the end of
  the story. God is not just a refuge; He is the righteous Judge and King who
  will ultimately set all things right.

#### A. God the Judge: Setting the Pillars Right ({Est. Time: 6-7 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Psalm 75:1-3
        -   Reading/Context: The Psalmist gives thanks, acknowledging God's nearness. Then God speaks (v. 2-3), declaring He will judge righteously when the appointed time comes, even when the earth's foundations (pillars) dissolve.
        -   [WB]: Ps 75:2 `Appointed Time` -> `Judge Uprightly`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God has an "appointed time" for judgment. Human systems and authorities may fail ("pillars dissolve"), but God Himself upholds ultimate justice and order. This counters the despair that arises when earthly justice fails.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "According to Psalm 75:2-3, what is God's promise concerning judgment, especially when earthly structures seem to be failing?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Psalm 75:7-8
        -   Reading/Connection: Read verses. It explicitly states **God** is the judge, who decides destinies ("puts down one, and sets up another"). The "cup" represents His wrath against unrepentant sin.
        -   [WB]: Ps 75:7 `GOD is the JUDGE` -> `Cup of Wrath` (v.8)
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: True judgment belongs to God alone. This calls us to humility, recognizing we are not the arbiters of others' fates. It also highlights the seriousness of sin and the **necessity of aligning our lives with God's standard** before that judgment. Our character must reflect His righteousness.
        -   [EGW]: "Every act of obedience to Christ, every act of self-denial for His sake, every trial well endured, every victory gained over temptation, is a step in the march to the glory of final victory." ([MB 140.3]). This obedience stems from recognizing His authority as Judge and King.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How should the reality that God is the ultimate Judge affect how we view injustice in the world and how we relate to others?"

#### B. God the King: Establishing His Eternal Reign ({Est. Time: 4-5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Psalm 47:1-4, 7-8
        -   Reading/Context: A psalm of exuberant praise, calling all peoples to recognize God as the great King over **all** the earth. He subdues nations and chooses our inheritance.
        -   [WB]: Ps 47:7 `GOD is KING of all the earth` -> `Reigns over nations`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This anticipates the **full establishment** of God's kingdom, where His sovereignty is universally acknowledged. While the kingdom of grace exists now, the kingdom of glory is future.
        -   [EGW]: "The kingdom of God's grace is now being established... But the full establishment of the kingdom of His glory will not take place until the second coming of Christ to this world." ([MB 108.2]).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a rightful king returning to claim his throne after a period of rebellion. His arrival brings order, justice, and peace. Christ's return will establish His undisputed reign.
    -   **Foundation Texts 4 & 5:** Zechariah 14:4, 9 & 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17
        -   Reading/Connection: Zech 14:4, 9 describes the literal event of Christ's feet touching the Mount of Olives and Him becoming King over all the earth. 1 Thess 4 describes the saints meeting the Lord *in the air* at the Second Coming (before the Zech 14 event at the end of the millennium). These texts point to the culmination of His Kingship.
        -   [WB]: Zech 14:9 `LORD King over all Earth` <-> 1 Thess 4:17 `Meet Lord in the air`
        -   Practical Step & Character Focus: Acknowledging God as King **now** means submitting our will, our plans, our character to His rule. It means living as loyal citizens of His coming kingdom, developing characters marked by **submission, obedience, and praise**, ready to meet Him.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "If God is truly King over all the earth (Ps 47:7), what is one area of our lives where we need to more fully surrender to His kingship this week?"

### IV. Reflecting God's Character and Mission in the Last Days (10-11 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Knowing God is our Refuge and King isn't just for
  our comfort; it compels us to action. Psalm 67 shows the connection between
  receiving God's blessing and fulfilling His mission, which requires a
  transformed character.

#### A. Receiving God's Light to Be a Light ({Est. Time: 5-6 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Psalm 67:1-2
        -   Reading/Context: The psalm begins with a plea for God's mercy and blessing, specifically asking His face to **shine** upon us. The stated **purpose** is so His ways and salvation may be known globally.
        -   [WB]: Ps 67:1 `God be merciful... SHINE upon us` -> Ps 67:2 `That Your WAY be known`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God blesses us **not** for selfish enjoyment, but so we can reflect His character (His shining face) to the world. Receiving His grace transforms us, making us conduits of His salvation.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "According to Psalm 67:1-2, what is the direct link between receiving God's blessing and the knowledge of His salvation among the nations?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Isaiah 56:7
        -   Reading/Connection: This verse speaks of God's house being a "house of prayer for **all nations**," reinforcing the global scope of God's plan that Israel, and later the church, were called to facilitate. Psalm 67 is a prayer aligned with this purpose.
        -   [WB]: Isa 56:7 `House of Prayer for ALL NATIONS`
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Our lives, individually and corporately, are meant to be living testimonies that draw others to God. This requires a character reflecting His – merciful, gracious, righteous. We cannot reflect light we do not possess through a living connection with Christ. Our **sanctification** is essential to mission.
        -   [EGW]: "It is God's purpose to manifest through His people the principles of His kingdom... By beholding the goodness, the mercy, the justice, and the love of God revealed in His church, the world is to have a representation of His character." ([Rec. Pam 145, p.3]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does the understanding that God blesses us *so that* we can be a blessing change our motivation for seeking Him and living for Him?"

#### B. The Final Call and Our Character Response ({Est. Time: 5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Psalm 67:3-4 (Memory Text)
        -   Reading/Context: The call for **all peoples** to praise God because He will judge righteously and govern justly. This echoes the universal call of the final gospel message.
        -   [WB]: Ps 67:3-4 `Let ALL peoples PRAISE YOU` -> `Judge Righteously`
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 14:6-7
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the first angel's message – the everlasting gospel proclaimed to **every nation, kindred, tongue, and people**, calling them to fear God, give glory to Him, and worship the Creator, because the hour of His **judgment** has come. This is the end-time fulfillment of the Psalmist's prayer.
        -   [WB]: Rev 14:6-7 `Everlasting Gospel to ALL` -> `Fear God... Judgment is come`
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a lighthouse on a stormy coast. Its purpose is to shine brightly, warning ships of danger and guiding them to safety. Our lives, reflecting Christ's character, should serve as that guiding light in earth's final darkness.
        -   Practical Step & Character Focus: Participating in God's final mission requires more than just words; it requires lives transformed by His grace, characters that embody the **righteousness**, **justice**, and **mercy** we proclaim. Are we allowing God to perfect His character in us so we can faithfully represent Him in these last days?
        -   [EGW]: "Thus the message of the third angel will be proclaimed. As the time comes for it to be given with greatest power, the Lord will work through humble instruments, leading the minds of those who consecrate themselves to His service." ([GC 606.2]). Consecration involves character surrender.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Considering the call to reflect God's character to the world (Ps 67) and the final message (Rev 14), what specific aspect of Christ's character do you feel God calling you to develop more fully through His power?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from the Psalms that God is our
  absolute Refuge amidst chaos (Ps 46), the righteous Judge and sovereign King
  whose kingdom will triumph (Ps 75, 47), and He calls us to reflect His
  character and share His salvation with the world (Ps 67).
- Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** call is high: to develop characters
  of **faith**, **stillness**, **humility**, **submission**, and
  **righteousness**, reflecting Christ perfectly. This is not optional; it is
  preparation for citizenship in His eternal kingdom and essential for His final
  work.
  - [WB]: Key Traits: `FAITH`, `STILLNESS`, `SUBMISSION`, `RIGHTEOUSNESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: Will we merely seek refuge, or will we also submit to
  the King and allow Him to refine our characters for His glory and mission? Let
  us choose daily to "be still" before Him, surrender our will, and cooperate
  with His transforming work.
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `"BE STILL & SUBMIT"`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one area will
    you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week, yielding to
    His sovereignty?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The turmoil will increase, but our God reigns!
  Let us anchor our souls in Him, perfect holiness in His fear, and shine His
  light brightly, hastening the day when He is King over all the earth.
  - [EGW]: "Look up, look up, and let your faith continually increase. Let this
    faith guide you along the narrow path that leads through the gates of the
    city into the great beyond, the wide, unbounded future of glory that is for
    the redeemed." ([PK 732.1]).
  - [WB]: Final Hope: `"LOOK UP! OUR KING IS COMING!"` (cf. Heb 12:2)
