## The True Joshua

**Overarching Theme:** From Shadow to Substance: Entering God's Rest Through Faith in the True Joshua
**Central Focus:** To move beyond a historical understanding of Joshua and Canaan to embrace the present reality of spiritual warfare, the necessity of faith, and the true rest from sin offered only through Jesus, our Antitypical Joshua, for the perfection of our character.
**Key Texts:** Hebrews 3:7-4:11; 1 Corinthians 10:1-13; Joshua 1:1-9

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Have you ever tried to guess what an object is just by looking at its shadow? The shadow gives clues, but it's not the real thing. The Old Testament is filled with "shadows" that point to a greater reality. Today, we're moving from the shadow of a man named Joshua to the substance—the reality—of Jesus Christ.
-   Theme Introduction: Our theme is **"From Shadow to Substance."** We will see how God designed the entire story of Joshua and the entry into Canaan not just as history, but as a profound blueprint to teach us how to win our spiritual battles and enter His true rest today.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "From Shadow to Substance"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just a history lesson. Understanding this pattern is **CRITICAL** for us, "on whom the end of the ages has come" (1 Cor. 10:11). God is preparing a people to enter the heavenly Canaan, and that preparation is a work of character. The lessons of Joshua are our lessons for final-day readiness.
-   Roadmap: We will first look at God's divine blueprint of "types" in Scripture. Then, we will see how Jesus is the perfect fulfillment of the Joshua type. Finally, we'll answer the most important question: How do we, today, enter the true rest He has promised?

### II. God's Divine Blueprint: Understanding Type and Antitype (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Before we can see Jesus as the "True Joshua," we must understand from the Bible itself that God intended for us to see these connections. He wrote His plan into the very fabric of history.

#### A. The Shadow Points to the Reality (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Hebrews 8:5
        -   Reading/Context: Paul, talking about the earthly priests, says they "serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things." The earthly was a pattern of the real.
        -   [WB]: Diagram: `SHADOW (Earthly)`  <-- `PATTERN OF` --> `REALITY (Heavenly)`
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God gave Israel physical, tangible things (a sanctuary, a priesthood, sacrifices) to teach them spiritual, heavenly truths. These weren't random; they were divine teaching tools.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Based on this verse, why is it so important to study the Old Testament sanctuary and its services?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 1 Corinthians 10:11
        -   Reading/Connection: "Now these things happened to them as an example [a *typos*], but they were written down for our instruction..." Paul is directly applying Israel's wilderness experience to the Christian church.
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is our divine permission—our command—to see our own spiritual journey in Israel's. Their failure was a lack of faith and a desire for the things of Egypt. Our greatest danger is the same: unbelief and a heart that longs for the world over the promised land.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "If Israel's story is our 'example,' what is one of their failures in the wilderness that you see as a warning for God's people today?"

#### B. The Cross: Where Shadow Met Substance (7 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 10:1
        -   Reading/Context: "For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices... make those who approach perfect."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The sacrifices were a daily shadow, a reminder of the real sacrifice to come. They could point to the solution, but they couldn't provide it. They couldn't perfect the character.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine you owe an immense debt. A friend gives you a promissory note each day saying, "The debt will be paid." This is a comfort, but it doesn't cancel the debt. The sacrifices were God's daily promissory notes until Jesus came and, on the cross, cried "It is finished"—Paid in Full.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Matthew 27:51
        -   Reading/Connection: "And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom..." This happened the moment Jesus died.
        -   [WB]: Add to Diagram: `SHADOW (Type)` -> `[CROSS]` -> `SUBSTANCE (Antitype)`
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The barrier to God's presence was removed. The shadow system was over.
        -   [EGW]: "Type has met antitype in the death of God's Son. The great sacrifice has been made. The way into the holiest is laid open. A new and living way is prepared for all." (LHU 44.4).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Since the 'way into the holiest is laid open,' what does this mean for our personal prayer life and our confidence in approaching God?"

### III. The True Joshua: Captain of Our Salvation (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Now that we see the blueprint, let's look at the specific case of Joshua. The name "Joshua" in Hebrew is *Yehoshua*. The name "Jesus" is the Greek form of *Yehoshua*. Their very names mean "Yahweh is Salvation." God was making the connection plain from the start.

#### A. The Commission and the Conquest [*] (7 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 1:2-3, 9
        -   Reading/Context: God commissions Joshua to cross the Jordan and take the land. The command is "Be strong and of good courage... for the LORD your God is with you."
        -   [WB]: Two Columns: `JOSHUA (Type)` | `JESUS (Antitype)` -> Add under Joshua: "Leads into earthly Canaan"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Joshua was the divinely appointed leader to bring God's people into their physical inheritance. His success depended entirely on obedience and God's presence.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Matthew 28:18-20
        -   Reading/Connection: Jesus, our True Joshua, gives His great commission. He promises, "lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." The same promise of presence and power.
        -   [WB]: Under Jesus: "Leads into heavenly rest"
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Joshua's fight was for a physical piece of land, against enemies of flesh and blood. Our True Joshua leads us in a spiritual war (2 Cor. 10:3-5) for the territory of the heart, against principalities and powers, and against the idolatry within.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Joshua's enemies were visible Canaanite armies. According to Ephesians 6:12, who are our enemies today? How does this change the way we fight our battles?"

#### B. The Unfinished Rest and the True Rest (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 4:8
        -   Reading/Context: Paul makes a stunning point: "For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not afterward have spoken of another day."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The rest in Canaan was a shadow. It was incomplete. It was a physical rest that pointed to a deeper, spiritual rest that the people, because of unbelief, had not yet entered.
        -   [WB]: Under Joshua: "Gave temporary, earthly rest"
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "Why was the rest Joshua gave only temporary or incomplete?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4 & 5:** Hebrews 4:9-11
        -   Reading/Connection: "There remains therefore a rest for the people of God. For he who has entered His rest has himself also ceased from his works... Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience."
        -   [WB]: Under Jesus: "Gives eternal, spiritual rest from SIN"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the heart of the gospel! The **true rest** is not just for heaven someday. It is a present experience of ceasing from our own dead "works"—the desperate, failing struggle to make ourselves righteous—and resting completely in Christ's power to save and to sanctify. It is a rest **from sinning**, not a rest **in sin**. This rest is what perfects our character.
        -   [EGW]: "Our Redeemer manifested no human weakness or imperfection; yet He died to obtain for us an entrance into the Promised Land." (CC 111.6). He secured our entrance; our part is to believe and enter in.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Hebrews 4:10 says entering God's rest means 'ceasing from our own works.' What are some 'works' or efforts we try to save ourselves with, instead of fully resting in Christ's power to give us victory over sin?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that God uses historical "shadows" to point to the substance found in Jesus. Joshua and the rest of Canaan were a powerful type of Jesus, our True Joshua, who leads us not into an earthly land, but into a spiritual rest from sin and self.
-   Character Focus Recap: The promise of entering God's rest is the promise of sanctification. It is the promise that He can bring our characters into conformity with His will. The generation that fell in the wilderness could not enter because of **unbelief**. The only thing that will keep us out of the heavenly Canaan is the same thing.
    -   [WB]: Write: `CHARACTER PERFECTION` and `UNBELIEF = DISOBEDIENCE`
-   Call to Action/Decision: The question Joshua asked Israel echoes to us today from our Savior: "How long will you neglect to go and possess the land which the LORD... has given you?" (Josh. 18:3). Jesus has won the victory. He offers you rest from your struggle with that besetting sin, rest from your anxiety, rest from your own efforts. The call is to "be diligent to enter that rest."
    -   [WB]: Write Call to Action: `ENTER HIS REST (Hebrews 4:11)`
-   *(Optional Final Question):* "Based on God's Word today, what is one 'work' of self-effort you will surrender to Christ, to enter more fully into His rest?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Let us not be like the generation that saw the promised land but drew back in fear. Let us be the generation of Joshua and Caleb who say, "Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it" (Num. 13:30)—not in our strength, but in the strength of the True Joshua, the Captain of our salvation.
    -   [WB]: Write Final Hope: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS" (Hebrews 12:2)`
