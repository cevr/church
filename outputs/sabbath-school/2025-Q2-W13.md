## Images of the End

**Overarching Theme:** Heeding God's Final Call: Lessons from History for
Earth's Last Hour **Central Focus:** Cultivating a character of **humble
obedience** and **urgent responsiveness** to God's revealed will, recognizing
that historical patterns repeat and our choices determine our eternal destiny in
the face of impending judgment and deliverance. **Key Texts:** Daniel 5:22-23,
Jonah 3:5-10, Revelation 18:4, Matthew 24:42-44

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: "History repeats itself." We often hear this, but the Bible shows us
  _why_ it repeats, especially concerning God's dealings with humanity. Ancient
  stories hold urgent lessons for us _today_, living on the brink of eternity.
- Theme Introduction: Today we explore **Heeding God's Final Call**, drawing
  profound lessons from historical "images" – Nineveh, Babylon, Cyrus – that
  illuminate our path in these last days. Understanding these scriptural
  patterns is vital for our preparation.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Heeding God's Final Call"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: These accounts aren't just history; they are
  divine case studies revealing the character God requires – humility,
  repentance, obedience – to stand firm as Christ's return draws near. Our
  response determines our fitness for His kingdom.
- Roadmap: We'll examine the tragedy of ignoring God's warnings (Babylon), the
  possibility of repentance (Nineveh), and the nature of God's final call to His
  people today (Cyrus & Revelation).

### II. The Warning Ignored: Lessons from Belshazzar's Babylon (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Let's first look at a solemn warning – the story
  of Belshazzar, a man who knew better but chose defiance. This mirrors a danger
  facing the world, and even God's people, today.

#### A. Prideful Defiance Despite Light (5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Daniel 5:1-4
        -   Reading/Context: Belshazzar holds a feast, desecrating sacred temple vessels in drunken revelry, praising idols.
        -   [WB]: Daniel 5:1-4 / PRIDE / Defiance
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This wasn't ignorance; it was **deliberate** profanity. He was openly challenging the God of Heaven whose vessels these were. It shows a heart lifted up in pride against God.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What specific actions in these verses show Belshazzar's contempt for the God of Israel?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Daniel 5:18-22
        -   Reading/Connection: Daniel reminds Belshazzar of Nebuchadnezzar's humbling experience – how God gives/takes kingdoms, how pride leads to a fall, and Nebuchadnezzar's eventual repentance. Then the indictment: "But you his son, Belshazzar, have **not humbled your heart, although you knew all this**."
        -   [WB]: Dan 5:22 -> "Knew... yet NOT humbled"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the core tragedy! Knowledge without heart change is fatal. Belshazzar had clear evidence of God's power and the danger of pride, yet he **chose** the same path. This highlights the critical need for **humility** and learning from God's past dealings.
        -   [EGW]: "But Belshazzar allowed the love of pleasure and self-glorification to efface the lessons that he should never have forgotten. He wasted the opportunities graciously granted him... That which Nebuchadnezzar had finally gained at the cost of untold suffering and humiliation, Belshazzar passed by with indifference." (PK 522.2)
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...efface the lessons..."
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why is simply knowing about God's power or past judgments (like Belshazzar did) not enough to save us?"

#### B. Judgment and Unpreparedness (5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Daniel 5:23-28
        -   Reading/Context: Daniel continues: You lifted yourself against God, praised idols, and didn't honor the God who holds your very breath. Then the writing: Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin – Numbered, Weighed, Divided. Judgment is pronounced.
        -   [WB]: Mene (Numbered) / Tekel (Weighed) / Peres (Divided) -> JUDGMENT
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God weighs character. Belshazzar was found wanting – lacking the weight of genuine humility, repentance, and obedience. His time ran out. The judgment was swift and final that very night (v. 30-31).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine ignoring repeated 'check engine' lights in your car. You know something's wrong, maybe even remember a past breakdown, but keep driving recklessly until it dies completely on the highway. Belshazzar ignored God's 'check heart' warnings.
        -   Connecting to Life: Are there warnings God has given us personally, or through His Word, that we are ignoring due to pride, pleasure, or distraction?
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Matthew 24:43-44 (cf. Rev 16:15)
        -   Reading/Challenge: Jesus warns: "Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming... if the master of the house had known... he would have watched... Therefore you also be ready..." Revelation 16:15 adds, "Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame."
        -   [WB]: Matt 24:44 "BE READY" / Rev 16:15 "WATCH"
        -   Practical Step: Belshazzar was caught completely unprepared, spiritually "naked." Readiness isn't passive waiting; it's active watching, praying, and **character preparation** – putting on the robe of Christ's righteousness through surrender and obedience *now*.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Considering Belshazzar's fatal unpreparedness and Jesus' warning, what is one specific 'garment' of character (like humility, patience, faithfulness) we need Christ to help us put on this week?"

### III. The Warning Heeded (Partially): Lessons from Jonah & Nineveh (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Now, let's shift to a different response.
  Nineveh, a wicked Gentile city, heard God's warning through a reluctant
  prophet and repented. This shows God's mercy and the power of responding to
  His call, even imperfectly.

#### A. Reluctance vs. Divine Commission (4-5 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Jonah 1:1-3
        -   Reading/Context: God commands Jonah: "Arise, go to Nineveh... and cry out against it." But Jonah flees in the opposite direction, toward Tarshish.
        -   [WB]: Jonah 1:3 / Fleeing God's Call
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Jonah knew God's character (Jonah 4:2 - merciful), and likely feared Nineveh's cruelty *and* the possibility they might repent and be spared, making him look foolish or undermining his nationalistic pride. His reluctance stemmed from self-concern.
        -   [EGW]: "To the prophet Jonah came the word of the Lord... The prophet was tempted to question the wisdom of the call... While he hesitated, Satan overwhelmed him with discouragement, and he 'rose up to flee unto Tarshish.'" (FS 144.3 / Based on PK context)
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What fears or selfish concerns might make us reluctant, like Jonah, to share God's message or obey His specific promptings today?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Jonah 1:9
        -   Reading/Connection: Caught in the storm, Jonah identifies himself: "I am a Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land."
        -   [WB]: Jonah 1:9 -> Fear God / CREATOR
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Even in disobedience, Jonah identifies with the true God, the Creator. This identity is foundational. It connects directly to the first angel's message (Rev 14:7) calling us to worship the Creator – a core part of our end-time mission, which requires overcoming reluctance.

#### B. Repentance, Mercy, and Conditional Truth (6-7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Jonah 3:4-5, 10
        -   Reading/Context: Jonah finally preaches: "Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!" The response is immediate and city-wide: "So the people of Nineveh believed God, proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth... Then God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God relented from the disaster that He had said He would bring upon them."
        -   [WB]: Jonah 3:5, 10 -> Believed / Turned / God Relented
        -   Unpacking the Truth: A simple, direct warning led to genuine repentance ("works" showing changed hearts). This demonstrates God's incredible mercy and willingness to forgive when people turn from sin.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "What does Nineveh's response teach us about the kind of repentance God desires?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Jeremiah 18:7-8
        -   Reading/Connection: God explains through Jeremiah: "The instant I speak concerning a nation... to pluck up... if that nation against whom I have spoken turns from its evil, I will relent..."
        -   [WB]: Jer 18:7-8 -> Conditional Prophecy
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Nineveh's story illustrates that some prophetic warnings are **conditional** on human response. While final end-time events (like Christ's return, destruction of wicked) are certain, God extends mercy and opportunity as long as probation lasts. Our response matters profoundly!
        -   [EGW]: "God allows men a period of probation; but there is a point beyond which divine patience is exhausted... a time will come when pleadings for mercy will no longer be heard..." (PK 276.2)
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a doctor diagnosing a serious but treatable illness. The diagnosis (warning) is dire, but if the patient follows the treatment plan (repents/changes lifestyle), the outcome changes. Nineveh followed the treatment.
        -   Connecting to Life: God's warnings in Scripture and through circumstances are calls to change course.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Matthew 12:41
        -   Reading/Challenge: Jesus says the men of Nineveh will condemn His generation because "they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here."
        -   [WB]: Matt 12:41 -> Nineveh Repented / Greater than Jonah is Here!
        -   Practical Step: We have far greater light than Nineveh – we have Jesus Himself, the fullness of His Word, the Spirit's guidance. Our responsibility to heed God's call to repentance and character transformation is therefore much greater. Are we responding with the same urgency Nineveh showed?
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "If Nineveh repented at Jonah's stark message, how should we respond daily to the 'greater than Jonah,' Jesus Christ, speaking to us through His Word?"

### IV. The Final Call & Our Response: Lessons from Cyrus & Revelation (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Finally, let's look at God's ultimate purpose:
  deliverance and restoration for His faithful people, typified by Cyrus freeing
  Israel, and culminating in the final call out of spiritual Babylon. This
  requires a specific character.

#### A. God's Sovereign Deliverance (5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Isaiah 45:1, 4
        -   Reading/Context: Decades before Cyrus lived, God names him: "Thus says the LORD to His anointed, To Cyrus... For Jacob My servant's sake, And Israel My elect, I have even called you by your name..."
        -   [WB]: Isa 45:1, 4 -> Cyrus / God's Anointed / For Israel's Sake
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God orchestrates history for His ultimate purposes. He raised up a pagan king specifically to liberate His people, fulfilling prophecy precisely. This shows God's sovereignty and His unwavering plan for deliverance.
        -   [EGW]: "And now, when the time came for the temple in Jerusalem to be rebuilt, God moved upon Cyrus as his agent to discern the prophecies concerning himself, and to grant the Jewish people their liberty." (ARSH Mar 28, 1907, par. 5 / Adapted)
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** 2 Chronicles 36:22-23
        -   Reading/Connection: The historical fulfillment: "Now in the first year of Cyrus... the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus... He has commanded me to build Him a house at Jerusalem... Who is among you of all His people? May the LORD his God be with him, and let him go up!"
        -   [WB]: 2 Chron 36:23 -> Decree / Go Up! / Build!
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Cyrus's decree was a call to **action**, requiring faith and effort from the remnant. It foreshadows Christ, our true Liberator, who calls us out of spiritual bondage to build His spiritual temple (the church, our characters) in preparation for His return. Responding requires **faith** and **commitment**.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does seeing God use even a pagan king like Cyrus encourage us about His power to work through any circumstance for His people's good?"

#### B. The Final Call and the Character to Respond (5-6 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Revelation 18:1-4
        -   Reading/Context: A mighty angel declares, "Babylon the great is fallen... And I heard another voice from heaven saying, '**Come out of her, my people**, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.'"
        -   [WB]: Rev 18:4 -> "COME OUT of her, My people!"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the final, urgent call echoing down through history (cf. Lot from Sodom, Israel from Egypt/Babylon). It's a call to **separation** from the world's confusion, false worship, and compromises. It demands a decision.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 14:12
        -   Reading/Connection: What kind of people heed this call? "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who **keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus**."
        -   [WB]: Rev 14:12 -> Keep Commandments / Faith of Jesus = CHARACTER
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Responding to the call requires more than just intellectual assent. It requires a **transformed character** – one marked by endurance (patience), loyalty to God's law, and deep, abiding trust in Jesus. This is the character God is perfecting in His people now.
        -   [EGW]: "The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not be bought or sold... men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall. But such a character is not the result of accident... [it is] the surrender of self for the service of love to God and man." (Ed 57.3-4)
        -   [WB]: Quote Snippet: "...stand for the right..."
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine an urgent evacuation order before a hurricane hits. Some people hesitate, wanting to save possessions; others delay, doubting the severity; but those who value their lives heed the call immediately and leave everything else behind. The call "Come out of Babylon" requires that kind of decisive urgency.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Revelation 16:12
        -   Reading/Challenge: The sixth plague involves the drying up of the Euphrates, preparing the way for the kings from the east. Historically, drying the Euphrates allowed Cyrus (from the east) to conquer Babylon. Prophetically, it signifies the withdrawal of popular support from end-time Babylon just before Christ (our King from the East - Matt 24:27) returns.
        -   [WB]: Rev 16:12 -> Drying Euphrates / Support Withdrawn
        -   Practical Step: As worldly systems crumble and support for spiritual Babylon dries up, God's people must be firmly established on the Rock, Christ Jesus, having already answered the call to come out and be separate, demonstrating the character of Rev 14:12.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Thinking about the call to 'Come out of Babylon' and the character needed (Rev 14:12), what is one practical way we can ensure we are separating from worldly influences and deepening our commitment to God's commandments and faith in Jesus this week?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture the tragic end of
  ignoring God's light (Belshazzar), the hope found in repentance (Nineveh),
  God's sovereign power in deliverance (Cyrus), and His final, urgent call to
  His people today (Revelation).
- Character Focus Recap: The **scriptural** message is clear: God calls us to
  **humble responsiveness**. He seeks a people whose characters reflect His own
  – those who heed His warnings, keep His commandments, and live by the faith of
  Jesus, ready for His appearing.
  - [WB]: Key Character Traits: `HUMILITY` / `OBEDIENCE` / `FAITHFULNESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: Don't let these lessons be mere history. Let the
  **Word of God** penetrate your heart today. Where is God calling you to
  greater humility? To deeper repentance? To more complete obedience? To answer
  His call to "Come out"?
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `"HEED & OBEY"` (cf. James 1:22)
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one area will
    you specifically ask for His transforming power in this week, to better heed
    His call?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Time is short. The final events are hastening.
  Let us learn from the past, surrender fully to Christ today, and cultivate the
  character needed to stand. Let us be found watching, ready, clothed in His
  righteousness, looking for that blessed hope!
  - [WB]: Final Hope: `"LOOKING FOR THE BLESSED HOPE" (Titus 2:13)`
