### I. Introduction (5 mins)
-   Hook: "History repeats itself," they say. Have you ever seen patterns in how people or nations respond to warnings? Today we'll see how ancient stories hold urgent lessons for us living at the very end of time.
-   Theme Introduction: Our theme is **Responding to Divine Light**. It’s not just about *knowing* truth, but how we *react* to it. This determines our character and our destiny, especially now.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Responding to Divine Light)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: How we respond to the light God gives shapes who we become. Are we building characters fit for heaven, ready for Jesus' return? This is the vital work.
-   Roadmap: We'll look at Belshazzar's fatal mistake, Nineveh's surprising repentance, and what these "images of the end" mean for our choices today as we await Christ's coming.

### II. The Weight of Revealed Truth (Belshazzar's Example) (10 mins)
-   **A. Knowing vs. Heeding:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Belshazzar *knew* about God's power through his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar's experience, yet he deliberately defied God. Knowing truth isn't enough; it demands heart change and obedience.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Daniel 5:18-23 - Daniel explicitly reminds Belshazzar, "But you his son, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart, **although you knew all this**" (v. 22). His sin was defiance *against* known truth, profaning holy things.
    -   EGW Insight: "He wasted the opportunities graciously granted him, and neglected to use the means within his reach for becoming more fully acquainted with truth... Belshazzar passed by with indifference." (PK 522.2).
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: The danger of spiritual complacency or intellectual assent without transformation. We can have Adventist heritage, know doctrines, yet fail to humble our hearts.

-   **B. The Judgment on Willful Ignorance:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: God holds us accountable for the light we have received. Choosing to ignore or reject it leads to being "weighed in the balances and found wanting" (Dan 5:27).
    -   Biblical Foundation: Daniel 5:24-31 - The writing on the wall was a direct judgment based on Belshazzar's refusal to glorify God despite the evidence given him. The consequence was immediate and final.
    -   EGW Insight: "[Belshazzar] was guilty because he had had the privilege of knowing and doing the right... yet refused to heed the light that God had permitted to shine upon his pathway." (ST, July 20, 1891, par. 2).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Pride, love of pleasure, fear of change, cultural pressure – these can make us ignore the light God sends.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Imagine a doctor gives you a life-saving diagnosis and treatment plan. You understand it perfectly, acknowledge it's true, but then throw the plan away and continue the habits that are killing you. That was Belshazzar with spiritual truth.
-   *Hypothetical:* A student is given the exam answers beforehand but is too proud or distracted to study them, thinking they know better, and then fails the test. Belshazzar had the "answers" from his grandfather's life.

-   *Quote Snippet:* "...refused to heed the light." (ST July 20, 1891)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Daniel 5, what specific actions showed Belshazzar's defiance against the God he knew about?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it sometimes easier to *know* what's right than to *do* what's right? What makes humbling our hearts difficult?"
-   *(Application):* "In what practical ways can we ensure the 'light' we receive from Bible study or church actually changes how we live this week?"

### III. The Power of Humble Repentance (Nineveh's Example) (10 mins)
-   **A. Conditional Warnings & God's Mercy:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's warnings often come with an implied condition: repent, and judgment can be averted. Nineveh shows that even the most wicked can respond to God's call.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Jonah 3:4-10 - Jonah preached destruction ("Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown!"), but the people, from the king down, believed God, fasted, and turned from evil. God saw their works and relented. Compare Jeremiah 18:7-8.
    -   EGW Insight: "God revealed Himself to them in an unmistakable manner to lead them to repentance." (Splendor 144.3). God desires repentance, not destruction.
    -   Application/Character Trait Focus: Humility, teachability, willingness to change course when confronted with truth.

-   **B. The Reluctant Messenger & God's Heart:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: Our personal feelings or prejudices (like Jonah's) must not hinder God's mission. God's compassion extends even to those we might deem unworthy.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Jonah 1:1-3; 4:1-11 - Jonah fled because he *knew* God was gracious and might spare Nineveh (4:2), which he didn't want! God had to teach him about His own compassion for lost souls. Matt 12:41 highlights Nineveh's repentance condemning those who had *more* light (Jesus Himself) yet didn't repent.
    -   EGW Insight: "Jonah revealed that he valued the souls in that wretched city less than he valued his reputation." (ARSH, Oct 18, 1906, par. 8).
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Are we willing to share God's last warning message (Rev 14) even if it's unpopular or goes against our comfort zone? Do we share God's burden for the lost in "modern Ninevehs"?

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A city is warned of an impending hurricane. Some mock, some ignore, but the majority heed the warning, board up windows, evacuate low areas, and the predicted widespread devastation is largely avoided because they *acted* on the warning. Nineveh acted.
-   *Contrast:* Imagine two patients given the same serious diagnosis. One argues with the doctor, refuses treatment, and gets worse (like Belshazzar). The other humbly accepts the diagnosis, follows the treatment, and recovers (like Nineveh).

-   *Verse:* Jonah 3:10 / Matt 12:41

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What specific actions did the people of Nineveh take that showed their repentance was genuine?" (Jonah 3:5-8)
-   *(Reflection):* "Jonah knew God was merciful (Jonah 4:2). Why did this make him *reluctant* to preach? What does this teach us about our own motives in witnessing?"
-   *(Application):* "How can we cultivate a heart like God's, that desires repentance and salvation even for those we might find difficult or 'wicked'?"

### IV. The Final Call and Our Choice (Modern Babylon & Cyrus) (12 mins) [*]
-   **A. Babylon's Fall: A Type of the End:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Ancient Babylon's sudden fall during a time of careless revelry, facilitated by the "drying up" of the Euphrates, is a direct type of how spiritual Babylon will fall just before Christ's return.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Daniel 5:30-31 (Sudden fall); Revelation 16:12 (Sixth plague: Euphrates dried up to prepare way for kings of the East); Revelation 18:1-4 (Call to come out of Babylon before her final judgment). The drying river symbolized the removal of support systems for Babylon.
    -   EGW Insight: "The destruction of Babylon pictures to some degree the final destruction of the world... Destruction came upon Babylon while the king and his lords were engaged in feasting and revelry." (ST, Dec 29, 1890, par. 2).
    -   Application/Need & Solution: The world (spiritual Babylon) is characterized by pride, defiance, intoxication with pleasure, and false worship. The call is urgent: "Come out of her, my people" (Rev 18:4) – separate from her spirit and sins.

-   **B. God's Instruments & Our Readiness:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Just as God used Cyrus, a pagan king ("His anointed," Isa 45:1), to liberate His people and fulfill prophecy, He will use His divine power and chosen instruments to accomplish His final purposes. Our part is to be ready, faithful, and responsive to His leading.
    -   Biblical Foundation: 2 Chronicles 36:22-23; Isaiah 44:28-45:4 (Cyrus prophesied by name); Revelation 16:15 ("Behold, I am coming as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked and they see his shame."). Readiness involves spiritual vigilance and clothed in Christ's righteousness.
    -   EGW Insight: "The prophecies which the great I AM has given in His word, uniting link after link in the chain of events... tell us where we are today... and we may be assured that all which is yet to come will be fulfilled in its order." (PK 536.2). God is in control.
    -   Application/Character & Preparation: True readiness isn't just knowing prophecy, but having a character transformed by grace, living in obedience, clothed in Christ's righteousness daily. This is keeping our garments.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Metaphor:* Spiritual Babylon is like a grand, intoxicating party on a sinking ship. The music is loud, the lights are bright, but disaster is imminent. God's call (Rev 18:4) is the emergency announcement to get into the lifeboats *now*.
-   *Analogy:* Cyrus was like a divinely appointed key unlocking the prison doors for God's people. Christ's second coming is the ultimate unlocking, the final liberation for those who have heeded the call to come out of Babylon and are ready.

-   *Verse:* Rev 18:4 / Rev 16:15
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...all which is yet to come will be fulfilled..." (PK 536)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to Revelation 18:4, why are God's people called to come out of Babylon?"
-   *(Reflection):* "What does it mean practically to 'come out of Babylon' today, while still living in the world?"
-   *(Application):* "Revelation 16:15 connects watchfulness with 'keeping garments.' What daily habits help us stay spiritually watchful and clothed in Christ's righteousness?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (8 mins)
-   Summary: We've seen the fatal danger of ignoring God's light like Belshazzar, the hopeful possibility of repentance like Nineveh, and the urgent call to leave spiritual Babylon and be ready for the end, typified by ancient events.
-   Character Focus Recap: Responding rightly to God's light *is* the process of sanctification. It requires humility, surrender, and obedience, building characters that reflect Jesus – the only fitness for heaven.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: HUMILITY / FAITHFULNESS)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Don't let the light you've received today or this week be wasted. Choose one specific area where you know God is calling you to greater faithfulness or change. Will you humble your heart and obey?
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: HEED / OBEY / PREPARE)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "What is one truth God has impressed on your heart today that you will ask Him for grace to live out?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Time is short. The final events are hastening. Let us heed the warnings, embrace the transformation God offers, and stand ready. "The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not be bought or sold... men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall." (Ed 57.3). By God's grace, let us be those men and women.
