## The Conflict Behind All Conflicts

**Overarching Theme:** The Unseen Battle: Aligning with Heaven's Commander
**Central Focus:** To understand from Scripture that victory in our spiritual lives is not achieved by our strength or by convincing God to be on our side, but by a radical character change of absolute surrender and obedience, ensuring we are on **His** side.
**Key Texts:** Joshua 5:13-15; Exodus 14:13-14; Revelation 12:7-9

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Many of us pray, "Lord, please be on my side in this struggle. Help me win this battle." It's a sincere prayer. But what if God's first question to us, before any battle, is the one Joshua faced: "Are *you* on Mine?"
-   Theme Introduction: Today's study, "The Conflict Behind All Conflicts," goes beyond the wars in Joshua to the very heart of the Great Controversy. The profound scriptural truth is that every struggle on earth is a skirmish in a cosmic war, and our victory depends entirely on our allegiance.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "The Unseen Battle: Whose Side Are You On?"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: Our readiness for Christ's return is a matter of character. The central work of sanctification is learning to lay down our own battle plans and align ourselves completely with our divine Commander. This is the character that will stand in the last days.
-   Roadmap: We will explore the cosmic origin of this war in Revelation, see God's ideal plan for victory in Exodus, and then focus on the life-changing encounter Joshua had that frames the condition for all true victory.

### II. The Cosmic Context: Every Battle is a Skirmish in a Greater War (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Before we can understand the battles on earth, we must look to Scripture to see where the conflict began. The Bible reveals that the struggles in Canaan were not isolated events but earthly manifestations of a heavenly war.

#### A. The War's Origin and Nature (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Revelation 12:7-9
        -   Reading/Context: "And war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon... So the great dragon was cast out... to the earth..."
        -   [WB]: `Revelation 12:7-9` / Heaven ➔ Earth (with a downward arrow)
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This conflict did not begin with humanity. It began in heaven over the character and government of God. The earth has now become the central stage for this controversy.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "According to these verses from Revelation, where did conflict begin, and who were the primary combatants in that original war?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Isaiah 14:13-14
        -   Reading/Connection: Here we see the root motivation: "You have said in your heart: 'I will ascend into heaven... I will be like the Most High.'"
        -   [WB]: "I WILL" vs. "THY WILL"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The core of this rebellion is self-exaltation. Lucifer desired God's position but not His character of self-sacrificing love. This "I will" is the essence of sin that we must fight in our own hearts through Christ's power.
        -   [EGW]: "The same deceptive agency that seduced the angels in heaven is working in like manner upon human minds today. By means of his seducing statements he won the confidence of many of the angels, and there was a great war in heaven." (UL 338).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine two great kingdoms at war. A small border skirmish in a remote province is not just a local dispute. It's part of the larger war strategy. In the same way, our daily temptations, our struggles with pride or selfishness, are not small, private issues. They are skirmishes in the Great Controversy.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does the illustration of a 'border skirmish' change how you view your personal, daily temptations?"

#### B. Earth as the Battlefield (7 mins) [*]
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Exodus 12:12
        -   Reading/Context: During the Passover, God said, "...against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD."
        -   [WB]: YHWH > "gods of Egypt"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The plagues were not merely a show of force to free slaves. They were a direct, public judgment against the demonic powers that Egypt worshiped, demonstrating God's supremacy in the cosmic conflict.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Deuteronomy 32:17
        -   Reading/Connection: Scripture is clear: "They sacrificed to demons, not to God..." The command to eradicate the Canaanites was not about race; it was God's last resort to remove a terminal cancer of demonic worship and utter depravity that stood in opposition to His plan of salvation for the world.
        -   [EGW]: "The utter destruction of the people of Jericho was but a fulfillment of the commands previously given... The Canaanites had abandoned themselves to the foulest and most debasing heathenism, and it was necessary that the land should be cleared of what would so surely prevent the fulfillment of God’s gracious purposes." (CTr 134).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing that our spiritual battles are connected to this cosmic war, how should this truth change the way we pray for strength and deliverance?"

### III. The Condition of Victory: Surrender, Not Strength (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Now that we understand the "what" of this great war, Scripture shows us the "how" of victory. It is a principle that turns our human thinking upside down.

#### A. God's Ideal Plan: The Victory of Stillness (6 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 14:13-14
        -   Reading/Context: With the Red Sea before them and Pharaoh's army behind, Moses declared, "Do not be afraid. Stand firm... The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."
        -   [WB]: `Exodus 14:14` → "The LORD will fight... you be still."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God's perfect plan, His ideal for His people, is victory won through absolute trust and dependence, not human might. Our part is faith, stillness of soul, and obedience to His commands.
        -   [EGW]: "It was not His purpose that they should gain the land by warfare, but by strict obedience to His commands." (PP 392).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In this moment of crisis at the Red Sea, what was the one action God required from Israel for their deliverance?"

#### B. The Critical Encounter: Aligning with the Commander (9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 5:13
        -   Reading/Context: On the eve of his first battle, "Joshua... saw a Man standing opposite him with His sword drawn... And Joshua went to Him and said... 'Are You for us or for our adversaries?'"
        -   [WB]: Joshua's Question: "For Us or Them?"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is our natural, human question. We want God to join *our* team, to bless *our* plans, to fight for *our* cause.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why do we, like Joshua, so often ask God to take *our* side in a conflict, rather than first asking if we are on *His*?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 5:14
        -   Reading/Connection: The divine response shatters human perspective. "'No,' He said, 'but as Commander of the army of the LORD I have now come.'"
        -   [WB]: Christ's Answer: "NO... I am COMMANDER"
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The pre-incarnate Christ does not take sides; He **is** the side. He is in command of a battle far greater than Jericho. The ultimate question of the Great Controversy is not "Is God with us?" but "Are we with God?"
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a young lieutenant running up to the supreme allied commander on the battlefield and asking, "Sir, are you here to help my platoon take that small hill?" The commander's vision is the entire war. The lieutenant's duty is not to recruit the commander, but to get his platoon perfectly aligned with the commander's overarching strategy.
    -   **Foundation Texts 4 & 5:** Joshua 5:14b-15
        -   Reading/Challenge: "And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped... 'What does my Lord say to His servant?' ...'Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.' And Joshua did so."
        -   [WB]: `Worship → Surrender → Obedience`
        -   Practical Step: This is the unchanging sequence for victory. **Worship** (recognizing His authority), **Surrender** (laying down our plans), and **Obedience** (doing exactly as told). This is the character posture that aligns us with heaven.
        -   [EGW]: "It was not Israel, but the Captain of the Lord’s host that took Jericho. But Israel had their part to act to show their faith in the Captain of their salvation." (CC 117).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Practically speaking, what does it mean for you to 'take off your sandals' this week? What personal plan, right, or desire might you need to surrender to fully align with our Commander?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from Scripture that our earthly conflicts are part of the Great Controversy. God's ideal is to fight for us, but this victory is conditional on our alignment with Him.
    -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Based on our study today, what is the single biggest difference between asking God to be *on our side* versus ensuring we are *on His side*?"
-   Character Focus Recap: The character that is being perfected for heaven is one that has moved from asking God to join our cause, to one that daily falls on its face and asks, "What does my Lord say to His servant?"
    -   [WB]: `CHARACTER = ALIGNMENT`
-   **Illustration of Alignment:**
    -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a master surgeon performing a life-saving operation. A nurse doesn't walk in and say, "Doctor, I have my own idea for this procedure. Can you help me with it?" That would be disastrous. The nurse's entire value lies in perfectly aligning with the surgeon's plan, anticipating the next move, and handing over the right instrument at the right time. Our relationship with our divine Commander is the same. Our victory isn't in coming up with a plan and asking for His help; it's in surrendering our plan entirely to His masterful strategy.
    -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Thinking of the surgeon analogy, in what specific area of your life do you feel you've been presenting God with *your* surgical plan instead of simply asking, 'Commander, what is Your next instruction?'"
-   Call to Action/Decision: The battle for Jericho was won not by swords and spears, but by worship, surrender, and obedient marching. I appeal to you, stop asking God to help you knock down your wall, your way. Instead, follow Joshua's example.
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: "What does my Lord say?"
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The final movements of the Great Controversy are upon us. Our only safety, our only victory, is found not in our strength but in our complete surrender to the Captain of the Lord's Host, Jesus Christ, who has never lost a battle.
    -   [DQ]: *(Commitment - more rhetorical):* "As we close, what is the one 'Jericho' wall you will commit to stop pushing against on your own, and instead, begin marching around in obedient faith this week?"
    -   [WB]: Final Hope: "LOOKING UNTO JESUS" (Hebrews 12:2)
