## Giants of Faith: Joshua and Caleb

**Overarching Theme:** A Different Spirit: The Anatomy of Wholehearted Faith
**Central Focus:** To understand from Scripture the character of wholehearted, courageous faith that sees God as greater than any obstacle, and to cultivate this "different spirit" in preparation for entering the heavenly Canaan.
**Key Texts:** Numbers 14:6-9, 24; Joshua 14:6-14

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Have you ever been in a situation—at work, in your family, even at church—where the overwhelming majority felt one way, but you had a deep conviction from God to stand for something different? That moment of decision is where character is truly revealed.
-   Theme Introduction: Today we study two men, Caleb and Joshua, who faced that very test. The Bible says God honored Caleb because he had a **"different spirit"** and **"followed Me fully"** (Numbers 14:24). This lesson is a deep dive into what that spirit looks like and why it is the single most important quality for God's people living on the borders of the heavenly Canaan.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "A DIFFERENT SPIRIT"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: The Great Controversy is culminating. We face giants of doubt, worldliness, and compromise. God is not looking for a people who are perfect in their own strength, but for a people whose spirit is wholly and fully surrendered to Him, ready to move forward at His command, regardless of the apparent obstacles.
-   Roadmap: We will first go to the Bible to see the crisis at Kadesh Barnea that revealed this "different spirit." Then, we will look decades later to see the lasting fruit of this spirit in the characters of Caleb and Joshua.

### II. The Spirit of Faith vs. The Spirit of Fear (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** The entire nation of Israel stood at a fork in the road. Their response to a single report would determine their destiny. Here we see two clashing spirits—two ways of seeing the world—laid bare.

#### A. The Majority Report: A Perspective of Fear (7-8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Numbers 13:31-33
        -   Reading/Context: After 40 days of seeing God's promised blessings, ten of the twelve leaders came back with a report of doubt. Read v. 31-33.
        -   [WB]: "We are not able to go up..."
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Their report was a subtle mix of truth (there were giants) and soul-destroying unbelief (God is not able to overcome them). They measured the giants against themselves, not against God. Their conclusion: "we were like grasshoppers in our own sight."
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Unbelief is like looking through binoculars the wrong way. The promises of God appear small and distant, while the obstacles right in front of us appear massive and overwhelming. The ten spies were looking through the wrong end of the binoculars.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "The spies said they were 'like grasshoppers in our own sight.' How does our self-perception, the way we see ourselves, directly impact our faith in God's power?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Numbers 14:1-4
        -   Reading/Connection: The people's reaction was immediate and catastrophic. They wept, murmured, and wished for death in Egypt. They even chose a new leader to take them back to bondage.
        -   [WB]: GIANTS > GOD -> Murmuring & Rebellion
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The spirit of fear is contagious and always leads back to Egypt—back to the world and its bondage. It questions God's goodness and leadership. God is trying to form a nation of spiritual princes, but they insist on retaining the mindset of slaves.
        -   [EGW]: "These men, starting upon a wrong course, set their hearts against God, against Moses and Aaron, and against Caleb and Joshua. Every step they advanced in this wrong direction made them firmer in their design to discourage every attempt to possess the land of Canaan." `[EGW]` (CC 106.3).

#### B. The Minority Report: A Perspective of Faith (8-10 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Numbers 13:30
        -   Reading/Context: Before the tide of unbelief could sweep everyone away, Caleb stood up. His response was immediate, decisive, and full of faith. "Let us go up at once and take possession, for we are well able to overcome it."
        -   [WB]: "Let us go up AT ONCE"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Faith does not delay or debate when God has spoken. It acts on the promise.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Numbers 14:6-9
        -   Reading/Connection: Here, Caleb and Joshua lay out the theological foundation for their faith. This is the heart of the matter.
        -   [WB]: "If the LORD delights in us..."
        -   Deeper Insight: Their confidence wasn't in their military strength, but in their relationship with God. The real question wasn't about the size of the giants, but about the state of Israel's heart. They saw the Canaanites as "bread for us," a source of sustenance, because their "defense has departed." They saw with spiritual eyes.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "In Numbers 14:9, Caleb says the two crucial things are, 'do not rebel against the LORD,' and 'do not fear the people.' Why are rebellion against God and fear of the world two sides of the same coin?"
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Numbers 14:24
        -   Reading/Challenge: Here is God's own analysis of the situation. He pinpoints the exact quality that sets Caleb apart.
        -   [WB]: Different Spirit = Follows Me FULLY
        -   Practical Step: This "different spirit" is not a mystical feeling, but a conscious choice to "follow the Lord fully." This means no reservations, no compromises, no plan B. It is an all-in commitment.
        -   [EGW]: "And of Caleb He said, 'My servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed Me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.'" `[EGW]` (PP 391.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Following God 'fully' is a high calling. What are some seemingly 'small' areas of compromise in our modern lives that can prevent us from developing this wholehearted spirit?"

### III. The Fruit of a Different Spirit (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** A spirit of faith is not for a single crisis, but for a lifetime. Now we fast-forward 45 years to see the enduring character this spirit produces.

#### A. The Boldness of Enduring Faith: Caleb (8-9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 14:6-9
        -   Reading/Context: Caleb, now 85 years old, comes before Joshua. Listen to his testimony. He connects his actions 45 years prior to his present standing before God.
        -   Unpacking the Truth: His testimony is consistent: **"I wholly followed the LORD my God."** His long life was not an accident; it was the result of God's promise to one who was faithful.
        -   [EGW]: "Caleb's faith now was just what it was when his testimony had contradicted the evil report of the spies. He had believed God's promise that He would put His people in possession of Canaan, and in this he had followed the Lord fully." `[EGW]` (PP 512.3).
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 14:10-12
        -   Reading/Connection: Notice what he says about his strength. He gives God the glory. And then, he makes the most audacious request in the book.
        -   [WB]: "GIVE ME THIS MOUNTAIN!"
        -   Deeper Insight: He does not ask for a peaceful vineyard in a settled land for his retirement. He asks for the very stronghold of the giants, the place the other spies feared most. The spirit of faith doesn't shrink from challenges; it sees them as opportunities for God to show His power.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* This is like a decorated war hero, at the end of a long career, being offered any quiet estate he wants. Instead, he points to the last, most heavily fortified enemy bunker and says, "Give me that hill. The war isn't over until the enemy's greatest stronghold falls." This is the spirit of a true soldier of the cross.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "At 85, Caleb asked for another battle, not a retirement plan. What 'mountain' in your life—a difficult ministry, a broken relationship, a persistent sin—is God asking you to claim by faith, believing He will go with you?"

#### B. The Humility of Servant Faith: Joshua (7-8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 19:49-51
        -   Reading/Context: After all the land has been divided, after every single tribe and family has their inheritance, the book records one final allotment.
        -   [WB]: Leader -> Serves -> Inherits LAST
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Joshua, the commander-in-chief of all Israel, the successor to Moses, waits until everyone else is cared for. He takes his portion last. This is the other side of the "different spirit." It is not self-seeking.
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: True greatness in God's kingdom is measured by service, not status. Caleb's boldness and Joshua's humility are two expressions of the same spirit—a spirit that is entirely focused on God's will and God's people, not on self.
        -   [EGW]: "Joshua desired to lead them to serve God, not by compulsion, but willingly. Love to God is the very foundation of religion." `[EGW]` (CT 139.5).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Caleb's faith appears bold and confrontational, while Joshua's is expressed in quiet, servant leadership. How are both of these essential for a complete, Christ-like character?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We have seen from God's Word that the "different spirit" He desires is one of wholehearted faith. It is a spirit that chooses God's perspective over our circumstances. It produces both the boldness to claim God's promises and the humility to serve His people.
-   Character Focus Recap: This is the character God is seeking to develop in His remnant people. We must learn what it means to **"follow the LORD fully."**
    -   [WB]: Key Character Trait: `WHOLEHEARTED FAITH`
-   Call to Action/Decision: What report are you giving with your life? A report of fear, focused on the giants of this world? Or a report of faith, focused on the mighty God of heaven? The choice of perspective is ours to make, every single day.
    -   [WB]: Call to Action Keyword: `"FOLLOW FULLY"`
    -   Let us ask God to uproot the spirit of fear from our hearts and to fill us with that "different spirit" that enabled Caleb and Joshua to stand for Him.
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The same God who silenced the mob at Kadesh, who preserved Caleb for 45 years, and who gave him the mountain of giants is our God today. He promises to do the same for us as we stand on the borders of the heavenly Canaan. Our part is simple, but profound: to trust and obey.
    -   [WB]: Final Hope Phrase: ```"LOOKING UNTO JESUS" (Heb. 12:2)```
