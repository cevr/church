## In the Psalms: Part 1

**Overarching Theme:** Character Transformation for God's Presence: Becoming Fit
for Mount Zion **Central Focus:** Understanding the **biblical** standard for
dwelling with God, the **divine** source of transformation through Christ's
righteousness and God's revealed character (His Law), and the **practical**
outworking of this transformation in preparation for Christ's return. **Key
Texts:** Psalm 15, Psalm 24, Exodus 34:5-7, Hebrews 9:11-14, Revelation 14:1-5

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Imagine standing on Mount Zion, described in Revelation 14:1, with the
  Lamb, seeing the Father's name written on your forehead. What does that
  **truly** mean? It's far more than a label; it speaks of a deep, internal
  reality.
- Theme Introduction: Today, guided by the Psalms and other scriptures, we
  explore the **profound** biblical theme of **Character Transformation for
  God's Presence**. Understanding this is **CRITICAL** for us living in these
  last days.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Fit for Mount Zion: Character Transformation"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The Bible calls us not just to be forgiven,
  but to be **restored** into God's image (Gen 1:27, Rom 8:29). This process of
  sanctification, developing a character fit for heaven, is our preparation for
  Christ's soon return and dwelling eternally with Him. This is central to the
  Great Controversy.
  - [EGW]: "The central theme of the Bible... is the redemption plan, the
    restoration in the human soul of the image of God." (ST, Apr 18, 1906, par.
    1).
- Roadmap: We'll examine: 1) The **biblical** standard for God's presence
  (Psalms 15, 24). 2) The **divine** source of our transformation – God's
  character revealed (Exodus 34, Hebrews 9). 3) The **personal experience** of
  this transformation (Psalm 51, Revelation 14).

### II. The Standard for God's Presence: Who Can Ascend? (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The Psalms ask a vital question: Who is worthy to
  dwell in God's holy presence? Let's look at the **biblical** answer and see
  the high calling set before us.

#### A. The Unwavering Requirement ({Est. Time: 6-7 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Psalm 15:1-5
        -   Reading/Context: David asks, "LORD, who may abide in Your tabernacle? Who may dwell in Your holy hill?" (v. 1). He then lists the qualifications.
        -   [WB]: Ps 15:1 -> "Who May Dwell?"
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Read verses 2-5. Notice the emphasis on **actions** (walks uprightly, works righteousness), **speech** (speaks truth, does not backbite), and **integrity** (honors those who fear the Lord, keeps oaths). This describes a **perfected character**.
        -   [WB]: Keywords: Upright / Righteousness / Truth / Blameless
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "Looking at verses 2-5, what specific character traits stand out to you as requirements for dwelling with God?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Psalm 24:3-6
        -   Reading/Connection: Similar question: "Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? Or who may stand in His holy place?" (v. 3). The answer again points to inner purity and outward integrity.
        -   [WB]: Ps 24:4 -> Clean Hands / Pure Heart / Lifted Up Soul (to Vanity) / Sworn Deceitfully
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: "Clean hands" (actions) and "pure heart" (motives, thoughts). This standard seems impossibly high for fallen humanity. Who among us naturally meets this?
        -   [EGW]: Then we all cried out, “Who shall be able to stand? Is my robe spotless?” Then the angels ceased to sing, and there was some time of awful silence, when Jesus spoke: "Those who have clean hands and pure hearts shall be able to stand; My grace is sufficient for you." (EW 15.2).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "When you honestly compare yourself to the standard in Psalm 15 and 24, what realization comes to mind about your own ability to meet it?"

#### B. The Human Condition and the Only Hope ({Est. Time: 4-5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** 1 John 1:8
        -   Reading/Context: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."
        -   The Dilemma: The standard is perfection (Matt 5:48), but our condition is sinful. How can we bridge this gap?
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine trying to scale a sheer, impossibly high cliff face representing God's holy hill. Our own efforts (like faulty ropes and weak grips) inevitably fail. We need equipment and strength from outside ourselves.
    -   **Foundation Text 4 (Hope):** Hebrews 10:19-20
        -   Reading/Connection: "Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh..."
        -   [WB]: IMPOSSIBLE -> POSSIBLE (Through Christ's Blood)
        -   The Only Way: Access is not based on our perfect performance, but granted through Christ's sacrifice. **However**, this access is not merely positional; it initiates a **transformative** work within us, enabling us to *become* like the description in the Psalms.
        -   [EGW]: "Jesus accepts this disposition and effort [to obey] as man's best service, and he makes up for the deficiency with his own divine merit." (ST, June 16, 1890, par. 6).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How does understanding that access is *through Christ* (Heb 10:19-20), yet the standard *remains* high (Ps 15/24), motivate you in your daily walk with God?"

### III. The Source of Transformation: God's Character Revealed (10-12 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** If transformation is needed, where does it come
  from? The Bible reveals it comes from beholding and receiving God's own
  character, made possible by Christ.

#### A. God's Name, God's Glory, God's Character ({Est. Time: 6-7 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Exodus 33:18-19
        -   Reading/Context: Moses asks, "Please, show me Your glory." God responds, "I will make all My **goodness** pass before you, and I will proclaim the **name** of the LORD before you."
        -   [WB]: Glory = Goodness = Name = CHARACTER
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God equates His glory and His name with His character – His goodness, mercy, grace. This is the foundation.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Exodus 34:5-7
        -   Reading/Context: God fulfills His promise, proclaiming His name: "The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing the guilty..."
        -   [WB]: Ex 34:6-7 Keywords: Merciful / Gracious / Longsuffering / Goodness / Truth / Forgiving / Just
        -   Deeper Insight: This is the character—the "name"—that is to be written on our foreheads (Rev 14:1). It's a balance of mercy and justice, love and holiness. This character is the basis of His law.
        -   [EGW]: "God's glory, His character, His merciful kindness and tender love—that which Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel—were to be revealed to all mankind." (PK 312.3).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does understanding God's 'name' as His character (full of mercy, grace, truth, justice) impact how you view His commandments?"

#### B. Transformation Through Christ and the Indwelling Law ({Est. Time: 4-5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Hebrews 9:11-14
        -   Reading/Connection: Christ, our High Priest, entered the heavenly sanctuary "with His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption." Verse 14 asks: "...how much more shall the blood of Christ... cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?"
        -   [WB]: Heb 9:14 -> Blood Cleanses Conscience -> To Serve
        -   The Enabling Power: Christ's sacrifice doesn't just pardon; it **cleanses** the conscience, the inner person, enabling true service and transformation.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Hebrews 10:16-17 (quoting Jer 31:33)
        -   Reading/Context: "'This is the covenant... I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,' then He adds, 'Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more.'"
        -   [WB]: Law -> Heart & Mind
        -   The Mechanism of Transformation: This is how God's character gets "written" on us. His law (the transcript of His character) moves from external stone to internal principle, changing desires and thoughts.
        -   [EGW]: "The glory of Christ is his character, and his character is an expression of the law of God... In his humanity Christ was dependent upon the Father, even as humanity is now dependent upon God for divine power in attaining unto perfection of character." (ST, Dec 12, 1895, par. 2, 3).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a seal (God's character/law) being pressed onto softened wax (a yielded heart cleansed by Christ's blood). The impression left is a reflection of the seal itself. God desires to imprint His character onto us.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "What practical steps can we take daily to allow God's 'seal' – His character as expressed in His law – to be impressed more deeply on our hearts and minds?"

### IV. The Experience of Transformation: Cleansing, Truthfulness, and Witness [*] (10 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** What does this transformation look like in real
  life? Psalm 51 gives us a powerful picture of repentance and restoration,
  leading to the character seen in Revelation 14.

#### A. From Guilt to Cleansing and Joy ({Est. Time: 5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Psalm 51:7-10
        -   Reading/Context: David's cry after sin: "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow... Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me."
        -   [WB]: Ps 51:10 -> Create Clean Heart / Renew Steadfast Spirit
        -   The Personal Plea: This is the heart-cry for the transformation God promises. It acknowledges deep need and relies wholly on God's creative power for inner purity.
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Psalm 5:9, 11-12 (Contrast & Hope)
        -   Reading/Connection: Contrast the wicked ("no faithfulness in their mouth... inward part is destruction" v.9) with the righteous who trust God ("let all those rejoice who put their trust in You... let those also who love Your name be joyful in You." v.11-12). Cleansing leads to joy and alignment with God's character.
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Psalm 51 shows deep sorrow, yet Psalm 5 speaks of great joy for those who trust God. How are repentance and joy connected in the experience of transformation?"

#### B. The Fruit of Transformation: Truth and Witness ({Est. Time: 5 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Psalm 51:12-13
        -   Reading/Context: After asking for restoration, David promises: "Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners shall be converted to You."
        -   [WB]: Cleansed -> Restored -> Teach/Witness
        -   The Natural Outflow: Experiencing God's forgiveness and transformation creates a desire to share His ways with others. It's the foundation for effective witness.
        -   [EGW]: "No sooner does one come to Christ than there is born in his heart a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found in Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart." (SC 78.2).
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a spring deep in the earth. If it's polluted at the source, everything that flows out will be contaminated. But when God cleanses the heart (Ps 51:10 - "Create in me a clean heart"), He purifies the very source. Then, the words and actions that flow out—our witness—will naturally become pure, truthful, and life-giving, reflecting the character of the One who cleansed the spring. This is how "no deceit" is found in the mouth (Rev 14:5).
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 14:1, 4-5
        -   Reading/Connection: Back to Mount Zion. Who are these with the Father's name? "...These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes... And in their mouth was found no deceit, for they are without fault before the throne of God."
        -   [WB]: Rev 14: Name + Follow Lamb + No Deceit + Without Fault
        -   The End Result: This is the character produced by God's transformative work! Truthfulness ("no deceit") reflects the "pure heart" (Ps 24:4) and God's own character (Ex 34:6). Following the Lamb requires the "steadfast spirit" (Ps 51:10). This is fitness for God's presence.
        -   [EGW]: "But all who follow the Lamb in heaven must first have followed Him on earth, not fretfully or capriciously, but in trustful, loving, willing obedience..." (AA 591.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Revelation 14:5 says the redeemed have 'no deceit' in their mouths. How does cultivating absolute truthfulness in our words and actions, flowing from a cleansed heart (like the pure spring), reflect the character transformation God desires for us?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen the high **scriptural** standard
  for dwelling with God (Ps 15, 24), our inability to meet it alone (1 John
  1:8), and the **divine** provision through Christ's blood (Heb 9) and the
  revelation of God's character (Ex 34). This transformation involves His law
  written on our hearts (Heb 10), leading to cleansing (Ps 51) and a character
  reflecting truth and faithfulness (Rev 14).
- Character Focus Recap: God's purpose is **restoration** – His image, His
  character, His name – fully reflected in us. This **character perfection**,
  made possible only through His grace and power, is our fitness for His eternal
  kingdom and readiness for His soon return.
  - [WB]: Key Trait: `HOLINESS` / `TRUTHFULNESS`
- Call to Action/Decision: The call today is to fully surrender to this
  **biblical** process. Will we cooperate daily with the Holy Spirit, allowing
  Him to cleanse us, write His law on our hearts, and conform us to the
  character of Christ?
  - [WB]: Call to Action: `"BE YE HOLY" (1 Pet 1:16)` /
    `"FOLLOW THE LAMB" (Rev 14:4)`
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what specific
    aspect of His character (mercy, truth, faithfulness) will you ask Him to
    develop more fully in you this week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Time is short. Let us earnestly seek this
  transformation, looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our faith (Heb
  12:2).
  - [EGW]: "The little remnant who love God and keep His commandments and are
    faithful to the end will enjoy this glory and ever be in the presence of
    Jesus and sing with the holy angels.” (EW 66.2).
  - [WB]: Final Hope: `"LOOKING FOR THE BLESSED HOPE" (Titus 2:13)`
