## In the Psalms: Preparing to Stand on Mount Zion

**Overarching Theme:** The **profound** connection between reflecting God's revealed character (His "Name") and the qualification to stand with the Lamb on Mount Zion in the last days.
**Central Focus:** Understanding that true readiness for Christ's return involves a deep, heart-level transformation into His likeness, made possible only through His grace and High Priestly ministry, enabling obedience to His law.
**Key Texts:** Psalm 15:1-2, Psalm 24:3-5, Exodus 34:5-7, Revelation 14:1, Hebrews 10:16-22

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Ask directly, "The Psalms and Revelation ask a searching question: Who can stand in God's holy presence, especially in the final days?" (Ref. Ps 15:1, 24:3, Rev 6:17). This isn't just about location, but **qualification**.
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: Our study today, drawing from the Psalms and linking to Revelation, reveals that standing on Mount Zion requires reflecting the very character of God, His Name, written on our hearts. This is deeper than outward conformity.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Reflecting God's Character: Qualification for Mount Zion)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't theoretical theology; it's about the **essential character preparation** needed to meet Jesus face-to-face (Rev 22:4) and live eternally with Him. It's about sanctification and readiness.
-   Roadmap: We'll explore: 1. What God's character (His Name) truly is. 2. How sinful humans can possibly reflect it. 3. Why this reflection is critical for God's last-day people.

### II. What is God's Character? The Name on the Forehead (10-12 mins)
-   **A. God's Name = His Character Revealed:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: When the Bible speaks of God's "Name" (like on the foreheads of the 144,000 in Rev 14:1), it signifies His **character**, His very nature. It's not just a label.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Exodus 34:5-7 - When Moses asked to see God's glory (Ex 33:18), God proclaimed His **Name**, which was a description of His character: merciful, gracious, longsuffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving, yet just. This is the "glory" to be reflected.
    -   EGW Insight: "God's glory, His character, His merciful kindness and tender love—that which Moses had pleaded in behalf of Israel—were to be revealed to all mankind." (PK 312.3). His character is His glory.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: We often think of God's glory only as power or light, but its core is His **moral character**. Understanding this shifts our focus in sanctification.

-   **B. The Law: Transcript of His Character:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: God's Law (Ten Commandments) is not arbitrary rules, but a transcript of His character. To have His Law written on the heart (Heb 10:16) is to have His character imprinted within.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Psalm 119:55 ("I remember your name in the night, O LORD, and keep your law.") links Name (character) and Law. Romans 7:12 ("the law is holy, and the commandment holy and just and good").
    -   EGW Insight: "The glory of Christ is his character, and his character is an expression of the law of God... God's law is an exponent of his character, an expression of his holiness..." (ST, Dec 12, 1895, par. 2, 3).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Seeing the law merely as external rules hinders us from seeing it as the **pattern of Christlikeness** we are called to reflect through His power.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* A king's **signet ring** impresses his seal (his authority/identity) onto wax. Having God's name on the forehead is like His character being impressed upon our minds and hearts.
-   *Metaphor:* Like **family resemblance**. Children often resemble their parents not just physically, but in mannerisms or character traits. God desires His children to reflect His character.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* NAME = CHARACTER
-   *Diagram:* Exodus 34:6-7 <--> Rev 14:1 (Forehead)
-   *Verse:* Heb 10:16 ("laws into their hearts")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...glory... His character..." (PK 312)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Exodus 34, what words describing God's character stand out most to you?"
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it significant that God's 'Name' (His character), not just a title, is written on the foreheads of the 144,000?"
-   *(Application):* "How does understanding the Law as God's character, rather than just rules, change how we relate to it?"

### III. How Can We Reflect His Character? The Provision of Grace (10-12 mins)
-   **A. The Human Impossibility & Divine Solution:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Psalms 15 & 24 set an impossibly high standard for dwelling with God ("walks uprightly," "clean hands and a pure heart"). We **cannot** achieve this on our own (1 John 1:8). The solution is found only in the Lamb (Rev 14:1) and His High Priestly ministry.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Ps 15:1-5; Ps 24:3-5 (The standard). Heb 9:11-15; 10:19-22 (Christ's blood cleanses the conscience, provides access, enables the New Covenant promise). Ps 51:7-10 (David's plea for cleansing and a new heart).
    -   EGW Insight: David's life shows "sin can bring only shame and woe, but that God's love and mercy can reach to the deepest depths, that faith will lift up the repenting soul to share the adoption of the sons of God." (PP 754.3). It's God's work through faith.
    -   Application/Need Tackled: Addresses the discouragement of personal failure. Our hope isn't in self-effort but in **Christ's perfect righteousness imputed** and His **sanctifying power imparted**.

-   **B. Cooperation with Divine Power:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: While salvation and character transformation are God's work, He requires our **cooperation** – surrender, trust, and effort put forth in His strength.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Philippians 2:12-13 ("work out your own salvation... for it is God who works in you"). Hebrews 10:16 ("I *will put* My laws into their hearts") - God acts, but our hearts must be yielded.
    -   EGW Insight: "When it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts are put forth to this end, Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as man's best service, and he makes up for the deficiency with his own divine merit." (FW/ST June 16, 1890, par. 6).
    -   Application/Obstacles to Depth: Overcoming passivity or legalism. True faith actively lays hold of God's power for transformation.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Metaphor:* Trying to clean a **deeply stained garment** (our character) with just water (our effort) is futile. We need the powerful **cleansing agent** of Christ's blood (Ps 51:7 - hyssop).
-   *Analogy:* A **student learning from a Master Musician**. The student must practice (effort/cooperation), but the skill and beauty ultimately come from following the Master's instruction and example (reliance on Christ).

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keyword:* GRACE / CLEANSING / COOPERATION
-   *Diagram:* Cross -> Pure Heart (Ps 51)
-   *Verse:* Heb 10:22 ("draw near with a true heart")
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...faith will lift up the repenting soul..." (PP 754)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "According to Psalm 51, what did David ask God to *do* for him after his sin?" (Cleanse, create a new heart).
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is it crucial to understand *both* God's part and our part (cooperation) in character development?"
-   *(Application):* "What does 'drawing near with a true heart in full assurance of faith' (Heb 10:22) look like practically in your daily life?"

### IV. Why Reflect His Character? Readiness for Eternity (10-11 mins) [*]
-   **A. Qualification for God's Presence & Final Stand:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Reflecting God's character is the **necessary preparation** to stand without fault before His throne (Rev 14:5) and endure the final crisis. It's the evidence of genuine connection with Christ.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 14:1-5 (The 144,000 stand *with* the Lamb, have His Father's name, are without deceit/fault). Rev 22:3-4 ("His servants shall serve Him. They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads."). Ps 5:4-7 (Evil cannot dwell with God; the upright worship Him).
    -   EGW Insight: "But all who follow the Lamb in heaven must **first have followed Him on earth**, not fretfully or capriciously, but in trustful, loving, willing obedience..." (AA 591.2). Following = reflecting His character now.
    -   Application/End-Time Relevance: Connects character development directly to our fitness for translation and ability to stand firm during the time of trouble when probation closes.

-   **B. The Foundation for True Worship & Witness:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: A transformed character, reflecting God's love and truth, is the foundation for both acceptable worship (Ps 5:7 - worship in fear/reverence) and effective witness (Ps 51:13 - "Then I will teach transgressors Your ways").
    -   Biblical Foundation: Rev 14:6-7 (The everlasting gospel precedes the call to worship the Creator). 1 John 5:3 ("For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments"). Our lives must align with our message.
    -   EGW Insight: "No sooner does one come to Christ than there is born in his heart a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found in Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his heart." (SC 78.2). Transformation leads to mission.
    -   Application/Great Controversy Context: In the final conflict over worship (Rev 13 vs Rev 14), those who truly reflect God's character will stand as living testimonies to the truth and power of the everlasting gospel.

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* **Ambassadors** representing their home country. They must embody the values and speak the message of their government. We are ambassadors for Christ (2 Cor 5:20), needing to reflect His character.
-   *Hypothetical Example:* Imagine trying to enter a **secure, high-level meeting**. You need the right credentials and identification. Reflecting God's character is our spiritual "credential" for His kingdom.

-   *Question:* Fit for Heaven?

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "According to Revelation 14:4-5, what are some key characteristics of those standing with the Lamb?" (Follow Him, redeemed, no deceit, without fault).
-   *(Reflection):* "How does our personal character development impact our ability to truly worship God and share Him effectively with others?"
-   *(Application):* "Considering the urgency of the times, what is one area of your character you feel God calling you to surrender more fully to Him for transformation?"
