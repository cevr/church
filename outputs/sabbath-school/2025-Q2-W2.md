### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: "Have you ever thought about why understanding the *very first book* of the Bible is so **critical** for understanding the *very last*? What foundations laid in Genesis unlock the deep truths of Revelation and our preparation for eternity?"
-   Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: Genesis isn't just ancient history; it's the blueprint revealing the origins and unchanging nature of the Great Controversy between Christ and Satan, and the bedrock of God's amazing, unwavering plan of redemption. Understanding this foundation is vital today.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: Genesis: Foundation for the Great Controversy & Redemption)*
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about understanding the enemy's tactics (Gen 3) so we aren't deceived, grasping God's infinite love (Gen 22) to motivate our faithfulness, and building the **Christlike character** needed to stand firm in these last days. Our readiness depends on these foundational truths.
    -   EGW Insight: Prophetic history unites "link after link in the prophetic chain, even from Genesis to Revelation." (MR10, 171.1)
-   Roadmap: Briefly outline the journey: We'll explore how Genesis first reveals God's unchanging truth and love (the Lamb), the origin of sin and death (the Serpent's lie), and how this ancient conflict shapes our present reality and future hope.

### II. God's Unchanging Truth & Sacrificial Love: The Lamb Revealed (10-12 mins)
-   **A. The Steadfastness of God's Truth:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: In a world where truth seems relative ("truthiness"), Genesis establishes God's Word and character as **unchanging** and reliable from the beginning. This is the anchor for understanding prophecy and His promises.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Heb 13:8 ("Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever."); Mal 3:6 ("For I am the LORD, I do not change"); Isa 40:8 ("The grass withers, the flower fades, But the word of our God stands forever.") - God's foundational principles don't shift.
    -   Application/Problem Tackled: Counteracts the subtle modern temptation to doubt the Bible's infallibility or reinterpret foundational truths to fit changing culture. We need a firm anchor.

-   **B. The Nature of God's Love: Self-Sacrificing:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Genesis 22 gives us the first mention of "love" (ahabah) in the context of **ultimate sacrifice** – Abraham willing to offer Isaac. This foreshadows the **profound**, self-giving nature of God's love, culminating in the gift of His Son. It's the opposite of self-centered human 'love'.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 22:2, 12, 16 ("your son, your only son, whom you love"); John 3:16 ("God so loved... that He gave His only begotten Son").
    -   EGW Insight: "Oh, the mystery of redemption! the love of God for a world that did not love Him! Who can know the depths of that love which 'passeth knowledge'?" (PP 63-64). Heaven watched Abraham's test with intense interest, learning about the plan of salvation (PP 151).

-   **C. The Provision of God: The Lamb Provided:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Isaac's question, "Where is the lamb?" (Gen 22:7), echoes through Scripture. Abraham's answer, "God will provide for Himself the lamb" (Gen 22:8), points directly to Jesus, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world (Rev 13:8), first publicly identified by John the Baptist (John 1:29). Genesis lays the foundation for understanding Christ's **substitutionary atonement**.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 22:7-8, 13; John 1:29 ("Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!"); Rev 5:6-10 (The Lamb slain, worthy to redeem).
    -   EGW Insight: In the ram provided, "Abraham saw a symbol of Him who was to die for the sins of men." God desired to teach Israel that the gift reconciling them comes "from His own love." (DA 112-113).

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Analogy:* Just as a master architect's blueprint (Genesis) lays the essential foundation for a magnificent building (Plan of Salvation/Revelation), understanding Genesis is crucial for grasping the whole structure.
-   *Metaphor:* Abraham's willingness to give Isaac is a dim reflection of the Father's heart giving His **ultimate treasure**, Jesus, for us. It helps us glimpse the *cost* of God's love.

#### Whiteboard Visuals
-   *Keywords:* UNCHANGING TRUTH / SACRIFICIAL LOVE / LAMB OF GOD
-   *Diagram:* Heart (Love) → Cross (Sacrifice) → Crown (Redemption)
-   *Verse:* Heb 13:8 / John 1:29 / Rev 5:6
-   *Quote Snippet:* "...God will provide Himself a lamb..." (Gen 22:8)

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Observation):* "In Genesis 22, what phrase describing Isaac is repeated three times, emphasizing the depth of Abraham's (and God's) sacrifice?" (Your son, your only son, whom you love).
-   *(Reflection):* "How does understanding God's love as fundamentally self-sacrificing, shown first in Genesis, challenge the way our culture often portrays love?"
-   *(Application):* "When you feel uncertain about the future or God's promises, how can remembering His unchanging nature (Heb 13:8) and His ultimate sacrifice (the Lamb) strengthen your faith?"

### III. The Genesis of Sin, Deception, and Death: The Serpent's Strategy (10-12 mins)
-   **A. The Serpent's Lie: Doubting God's Word & Character:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Genesis 3 reveals the **serpent's core strategy**, used throughout history: casting doubt on God's Word ("Has God indeed said...?"), questioning His motives/goodness, and appealing to pride/self-exaltation ("You will be like God"). This is the foundation of all false worship and deception seen in Revelation.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 3:1-5; Rev 12:9 ("that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world"); John 8:44 (Satan is "a liar and the father of it").
    -   EGW Insight: Eve was deceived by the serpent's sophistry, reminding her of God's prohibition while denying the consequence, appealing to her desire for a "higher state." (PP 55). Satan's character is revealed in his efforts to destroy Christ (ST, Mar 26, 1894, par. 2).

-   **B. The Consequence: Sin, Separation, and Death:**
    -   Core Teaching Point: Genesis establishes the **dire consequence** of believing the lie and disobeying God: not enlightenment, but separation from the Life-giver, resulting in death (Gen 2:17). The first death (Abel, Gen 4:8) tragically illustrates sin's destructive reality – an intruder, not a natural part of life. This understanding is crucial for appreciating Christ's victory over death (Rev 1:18).
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 2:17 ("you shall surely die"); Rom 6:23 ("The wages of sin is death"); Gen 4:8; Rev 1:18 ("I have the keys of Hades and of Death").
    -   EGW Insight: Death is the "utter extinction of life," the result of being cut off from the tree of life. Immortality was forfeited and is only regained through Christ. (GC 532-533). Abel's murder was the first example of the enmity between the serpent's seed and the woman's seed (PP 77).

-   **C. The Unchanging Conflict: Enmity Established:** [*]
    -   Core Teaching Point: God Himself declared the **ongoing enmity** (Gen 3:15) between Satan's kingdom (deception, rebellion) and Christ's kingdom (truth, obedience). This conflict, originating in Genesis, is the central theme of the Great Controversy, culminating in Revelation. Understanding its roots helps us recognize its manifestations today.
    -   Biblical Foundation: Gen 3:15 ("I will put enmity..."); Rev 12 (War in heaven, dragon persecutes woman).
    -   EGW Insight: This enmity is not natural; sinful man is naturally allied with Satan. It is **Christ's grace** implanted in the soul that creates this conflict and enables resistance. (GC 505-506).

#### Illustrative Speaking Notes (Choose 1-2)
-   *Metaphor:* Satan's lies are like **poison disguised as attractive food or medicine**. It promises elevation but delivers death. Genesis unmasks the poison.
-   *Analogy:* Sin entering the world was like a **crack in the foundation** of a perfect building. It compromised the entire structure, leading to decay and eventual ruin, requiring the Master Builder (Christ) to intervene.

#### Whiteboard Visuals

-   *Verse:* Gen 3:4-5 / Rom 6:23 / Rev 12:9
-   *Question:* Recognizing the Lie Today?

#### Discussion Questions (Allow brief time)
-   *(Simple/Recall):* "What was the very first question the serpent asked Eve in Genesis 3, designed to create doubt?" ("Has God indeed said...?")
-   *(Reflection):* "Why is the lie 'You shall not surely die' (Gen 3:4) still so powerful and prevalent in different forms today (e.g., spiritualism, minimizing sin)?"
-   *(Application):* "Knowing the serpent's primary tactic is to make us doubt God's Word and goodness, what practical steps can we take this week to strengthen our trust in God's commands and character?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary: Reiterate that Genesis isn't just stories; it's the **essential foundation** for understanding the Great Controversy, the unchanging nature of God's truth and sacrificial love (the Lamb), the devastating reality of sin and death, and the serpent's deceptive tactics. These truths unlock Revelation and prepare us for the end.
-   Character Focus Recap: Emphasize that understanding these foundations is **CRITICAL** for character development. We need discernment (to recognize the serpent's lies), deep gratitude (for the Lamb's sacrifice), and unwavering faithfulness (rooted in God's unchanging love) to reflect Christ fully.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: DISCERNMENT / FAITHFULNESS)*
-   Call to Action/Decision: Challenge class members to **consciously choose** this week to view current events and personal struggles through the lens of the Great Controversy revealed in Genesis. Ask God for wisdom to discern truth from error and to rely wholly on the Lamb.
    -   *(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: STAND on the FOUNDATION)*
    -   *(Optional Final Question):* "Reflecting on Genesis as the foundation, what specific truth we discussed today will you ask God to make more real in your life this week?" (Lead into prayer)
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: End with the assurance that though the conflict began in Genesis and rages now, the Lamb wins! Christ holds the keys (Rev 1:18). He made provision from the foundation of the world.
    -   EGW Insight: Christ's death ransoms many, destroys Satan, recovers the kingdom, and blots out sin forever. (PP 64-65).
