---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Every sturdy building needs a solid foundation. Our faith, especially
  our understanding of last-day events in Revelation, rests firmly on the
  foundations laid in Genesis. What happens when a foundation is ignored or
  misunderstood?
- Theme Introduction: State the **profound** biblical theme: Genesis isn't just
  ancient history; it's the divine unveiling of the **Great Controversy**
  between Christ and Satan, the origin of sin and death, and the first glimmers
  of God's incredible **Plan of Redemption** centered on the Lamb. Understanding
  this **scriptural depth** is CRITICAL for navigating the present and preparing
  for eternity.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Genesis: Foundation of the Great Controversy
    & Redemption"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: This isn't just theology; it's about **us**.
  Genesis reveals the battleground for our hearts and minds. Understanding the
  enemy's tactics (Gen 3) and God's provision (Gen 3:15, Gen 22) is essential
  for **character perfection** (restoration of God's image) and readiness for
  Christ's soon return.
- Roadmap: We will explore how Genesis introduces (1) The Seed of Conflict and
  God's First Promise, and (2) The Lamb Foreshadowed as God's Ultimate Solution.

### II. The Seed of Conflict: Eden's Tragedy, Heaven's Promise (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Let's go back to the beginning, not just of the
  world, but of the conflict that engulfs us all. Genesis 3 reveals the enemy's
  strategy and God's immediate response.

#### A. The Serpent's Lie and Humanity's Fall ({Est. 8-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 3:1-5
        -   Reading/Context: Read the serpent's subtle questioning and outright contradiction of God's Word.
        -   [WB]: {Gen 3:1-5 / Serpent's Lies vs. God's Command}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Satan's core attack is against **God's character and His Word**. He introduces doubt ("Did God really say?"), misrepresents God's motives (restriction vs. protection), and offers false promises (godhood, no consequences). This is the essence of sin: **distrust** leading to **rebellion**.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Reflection):* "What specific doubts or lies did the serpent plant in Eve's mind? How are similar doubts sown today about God's Word or His goodness?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Genesis 3:6-8
        -   Reading/Connection: Read about the choice and its immediate aftermath – fear, hiding, broken relationship.
        -   [WB]: {Choice -> Sin -> Fear -> Separation}
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: Sin isn't just breaking a rule; it's breaking **trust** and **relationship**. It promised elevation but brought degradation and fear. Our inherent character flaw, inherited selfishness, makes us susceptible. We need God's intervention.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a perfectly clear stream (relationship with God). Sin is like dumping mud into it – the clarity is gone, connection obscured. Or, a cracked foundation compromises the entire structure above.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Adam and Eve hid from God. What are ways we try to 'hide' from God when we know we've failed? What does this reveal about our need?"

#### B. God's Judgment and First Promise ({Est. 7-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Genesis 3:14-15
        -   Reading/Context: Read God's pronouncement on the serpent, including the pivotal promise in verse 15.
        -   [WB]: {Gen 3:15 - "I will put ENMITY"}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the **Protoevangelium** – the first gospel promise! God Himself declares war between Satan ("serpent," "thy seed") and humanity ("the woman," "her seed" - ultimately Christ). This "enmity" (hostility) is not natural; it's **divinely implanted grace** to counteract our natural inclination towards sin.
        -   [EGW]: "It is the grace that Christ implants in the soul which creates in man enmity against Satan. Without this converting grace and renewing power, man would continue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his bidding." (GC 506.1).
        -   [WB]: {Grace -> Enmity against Sin}
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine being born with an allergy to something vital, like pure air (representing sin's natural appeal). God's grace acts like a divine intervention, creating a reaction (enmity) against that harmful element, enabling us to desire what is truly life-giving (God's way).
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "What does it mean that God puts 'enmity' between us and Satan? Why is this a hopeful promise, not just a declaration of conflict?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Revelation 12:9
        -   Reading/Connection: Connect the "serpent of old" in Genesis to the "dragon... who deceives the whole world" in Revelation.
        -   [WB]: {Genesis Serpent = Revelation Dragon}
        -   Practical Step & Character Focus: The battle lines drawn in Eden extend to the end of time. We are participants. Understanding the origin of the conflict helps us recognize the enemy's unchanging tactics (deception, accusation). Our character is formed as we choose daily, through God's grace, to nurture that God-given **enmity** towards sin and align ourselves with Christ ("her seed"). This requires **constant vigilance** and **dependence** on God.

### III. The Lamb Foreshadowed: Sacrifice and Substitution (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The conflict required a solution beyond human
  capacity. Genesis begins to unveil God's amazing answer, pointing forward to
  the Lamb who would resolve the crisis.

#### A. The Ultimate Test, The Pointing Question ({Est. 8-9 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Genesis 22:1-2
        -   Reading/Context: Read God's staggering command to Abraham. Emphasize the cost – "your only son Isaac, whom you love."
        -   [WB]: {Gen 22:2 / Mt. Moriah / Test of Faith}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This wasn't arbitrary cruelty. It tested Abraham's **faith** and **surrender**, but more profoundly, it foreshadowed the Father's sacrifice of His **own beloved Son**. It reveals the depth of God's love and the terrible cost of sin.
        -   [EGW]: "Before the Father He pleaded in the sinner's behalf... yet it was a struggle, even with the King of the universe, to yield up His Son to die for the guilty race. But 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son...'" (PP 63.3-64.1).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "What does Abraham's willingness (though agonizing) teach us about the kind of faith and surrender God desires as He works to perfect our character?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Genesis 22:7-8
        -   Reading/Connection: Read Isaac's poignant question and Abraham's faith-filled answer.
        -   [WB]: {Isaac: "Where is the lamb?" / Abraham: "God will provide..."}
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This is the central question echoing through the Old Testament: Where is the sacrifice sufficient for sin? Abraham's answer points prophetically to God's own provision. Our character need is to **trust** God's provision even when we don't see the answer yet.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine owing an impossibly large debt you could never repay. Then someone infinitely wealthy steps in and says, "I will provide the payment." That's what God promised regarding sin's debt.

#### B. The Lamb Provided, The Lamb Revealed ({Est. 7-8 mins})

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Genesis 22:11-14
        -   Reading/Context: Read about the divine intervention and the provision of the ram caught in the thicket – the substitute.
        -   [WB]: {Ram = Substitute / "Jehovah-Jireh" (The Lord Will Provide)}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: God provided a **substitute**. Isaac was spared because another took his place. This powerfully illustrates the principle of **substitutionary atonement**. God Himself provided the sacrifice necessary.
        -   [EGW]: "...then light was shed upon the mystery of redemption, and even the angels understood more clearly the wonderful provision that God had made for man's salvation." (PP 151.2).
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Think of a courtroom scene. We stand guilty, facing a just sentence (death). Suddenly, someone innocent and infinitely valuable steps forward and tells the judge, "I will take their sentence. Let them go free." The ram was a picture of this divine exchange.
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "How does the ram caught in the thicket help us understand what Jesus did for us?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** John 1:29
        -   Reading/Connection: Read John the Baptist's declaration upon seeing Jesus. This is the direct answer to Isaac's question!
        -   [WB]: {John 1:29 -> "Behold! The Lamb of God!"}
        -   Deeper Insight: Jesus is the Lamb **God Himself provided**, foreshadowed on Mount Moriah, fulfilling centuries of prophecy. He takes away the sin of the world.
    -   **Foundation Text 5:** Revelation 5:6, 9-10
        -   Reading/Connection: Read the description of the Lamb in heaven – looking as though it had been slain, yet standing, worthy to open the scroll.
        -   [WB]: {Rev 5:6 / Lamb Slain, Yet Standing = Victorious}
        -   Practical Step & Character Focus: The Lamb provided in Genesis is the Lamb victorious in Revelation. He overcame sin and death through sacrifice. Our path to character perfection and eternal life is through **faith in His sacrifice** and **surrender to His Lordship**. We must allow the Lamb to take away *our* sin, daily choosing His way over self.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing Jesus is the Lamb provided *for you*, what specific burden or sin do you need to consciously surrender to Him this week, trusting His substitutionary death?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: Genesis lays the foundation: we see the tragic
  entry of sin and death through deception (Gen 3), but also God's immediate
  promise of conflict and victory (Gen 3:15), and the foreshadowing of His
  ultimate solution – the sacrificial Lamb He Himself would provide (Gen 22).
- Character Focus Recap: The Great Controversy, begun in heaven and revealed in
  Genesis, demands a choice. God calls us to **holiness**, to reflect His
  character, made possible only through the **Lamb of God**. This requires
  **faith**, **surrender**, and nurturing the **enmity against sin** He
  provides.
  - [WB]: {Key Traits: `FAITH`, `SURRENDER`, `HOLINESS`}
- Call to Action/Decision: Don't just understand the foundation; build your life
  upon it! Embrace Jesus, the Lamb of God who takes away your sin. Choose daily
  to stand with Him in this great conflict. Let His sacrifice transform your
  character.
  - [WB]: {Call to Action: `"BEHOLD THE LAMB"` (John 1:29)}
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what aspect of the
    Lamb's sacrifice or the reality of the controversy will you focus on in
    prayer this week for His transforming power?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The conflict is real, the end is near, but the
  Lamb has already won the decisive victory! Let us anchor our hope firmly in
  Him, the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, who is soon to return in
  glory.
  - [WB]: {Hope: `Rev 5:12 - "WORTHY IS THE LAMB"`}
