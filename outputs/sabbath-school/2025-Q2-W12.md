**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: "Have you ever felt pressured to compromise your beliefs, even in small ways? Imagine that pressure magnified globally, with life-or-death consequences. That's the reality prophecy foretells."
- Theme Introduction: State the **profound** theme: Unyielding Loyalty to God Amidst End-Time Coercion. This isn't just history (Daniel 3) or prophecy (Rev 13); it's about the **core** of our relationship with God.
  - _(Whiteboard: Write Main Theme Title: UNYIELDING LOYALTY)_
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The final crisis reveals character. Our daily choices now determine our stance then. Readiness isn't last-minute; it's a life built on faithfulness (Sanctification).
- Roadmap: We'll examine precursors (Daniel 3, NT persecution) to understand the coming test (Rev 13), focusing on the central issue of worship and the character required to stand firm.

### II. The Nature of the Test: Worship and Authority (12-15 mins)

- **A. The Demand for False Worship (Daniel 3):**

  - Core Teaching Point: Earthly powers, inspired by Satan, will demand worship and allegiance that belong only to God, setting human authority against Divine authority. Nebuchadnezzar's golden image represents this principle.
  - Biblical Foundation: Daniel 3:1-7, 13-15 - The command was absolute, the penalty severe (death). It forced a choice between the king's decree and God's command (Exodus 20:3-5).
  - EGW Insight: "How did that heathen king know what the Son of God was like? The Hebrew captives filling positions of trust in Babylon had in life and character represented before him the truth... in the form of the fourth in the midst of the fire the king recognized the Son of God." (PK 509.1). Their faithfulness _revealed_ God.
  - Application/Problem Tackled: The temptation to rationalize compromise ("Just bow physically," "God understands," "It's not worth dying for").

- **B. The Response of Faithfulness:**
  - Core Teaching Point: True loyalty doesn't calculate outcomes ("_But if not_...") but rests on God's character and commands, regardless of consequences. This requires deep-seated faith and courage.
  - Biblical Foundation: Daniel 3:16-18 - Their answer showed respect but absolute resolve. Their trust was in God, not necessarily in deliverance. Compare 2 Tim 1:7 - God gives power, love, sound mind, **not** fear.
  - EGW Insight: "Truth is to be obeyed at any cost... If you are loyal and true, that God who walked with the three Hebrew children in the fiery furnace... will go with you wherever you go." (ST May 6, 1897, par. 18).
  - Application/Obstacles to Depth: Fear of loss (social standing, possessions, life), desire for ease, lack of deep conviction built through daily relationship with Christ.

**_Illustrative Speaking Notes:_** (Choose 1-2)

- _Analogy:_ Counterfeit Currency - To spot the fake (false worship demands), you must intimately know the genuine (true worship of the Creator). The closer the counterfeit, the more discernment needed.
- _Hypothetical:_ Imagine a beloved teacher asking you to sign a statement you know is false to save their job. Loyalty to truth vs. loyalty to a person – the final crisis forces a choice between loyalty to God vs. loyalty to human systems demanding allegiance.

- _Verse:_ Dan 3:17-18 ("...we will not serve thy gods...")
- _Quote Snippet:_ "...but if not..." (Faith beyond deliverance)

**_Discussion Questions:_** (Allow brief time)

- _(Simple/Observation):_ "In Daniel 3, what was the specific command given by the king, and what was the penalty for disobedience?"
- _(Reflection):_ "Why is the temptation to compromise or rationalize ('just bow on the outside') so powerful in situations like the one the Hebrew worthies faced?"
- _(Application):_ "How can we cultivate the 'but if not' kind of faith in our _daily_ lives, before major crises hit?"

### III. The Final Test Foreshadowed: Revelation's Warning (10-12 mins) [*]

- **A. The Image and the Mark (Revelation 13):**

  - Core Teaching Point: Daniel 3 is a type, a precursor. Revelation 13 describes the final, global enforcement of false worship, centered around the "image of the beast" (apostate religious power influencing civil power) and its "mark" (sign of allegiance to that power's authority over God's).
  - Biblical Foundation: Rev 13:11-17 - Note the elements: deception ("miracles"), coercion ("cause... to be killed"), economic control ("buy or sell"). This mirrors Daniel 3 but on a worldwide scale. Compare Rom 1:25 - Worshiping the creature over the Creator.
  - EGW Insight: "Trial and persecution will come to all who, in obedience to the Word of God, refuse to worship this false sabbath. Force is the last resort of every false religion... The Papacy has exercised her power to compel men to obey her, and she will continue to do so." (ST May 6, 1897, par. 16).
  - Application/Character Trait Focus: Requires **discernment** (to see past deception), **courage** (to face persecution), and **integrity** (to refuse compromise).

- **B. Persecution Then and Now (Acts 12, Matt 12/John 5):** [*]
  - Core Teaching Point: Persecution of God's faithful people is not new. It often arises when faithfulness to God (like Peter's preaching, Acts 12:1-5) or obedience to His law (like Jesus healing on Sabbath, Matt 12:9-14; John 5:16) challenges human traditions or authority.
  - Biblical Foundation: Acts 12:1-5 (James killed, Peter imprisoned); Matt 12:14 (Pharisees plot death over Sabbath healing). The issues may differ slightly, but the conflict (God's way vs. man's way leading to persecution) is the same principle.
  - EGW Insight: "Though enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon walls cannot cut off the communication between their souls and Christ... angels will come to them in lonely cells, bringing light and peace from Heaven." (GC 626.2). God is present even when deliverance isn't immediate.
  - Application/End-Time Relevance: These accounts assure us God is aware and powerful, but also show that faithfulness may lead to suffering or death before ultimate deliverance. Our focus must be loyalty, not guaranteed earthly escape.

**_Illustrative Speaking Notes:_** (Choose 1-2)

- _Visual Metaphor:_ God's Seal vs. Man's Mark - Like an official seal authenticates a document, God's Seal (Sabbath) signifies His authority and ownership. The Mark is a counterfeit sign of allegiance to a rival power.
- _Analogy:_ Soldier's Allegiance - In wartime, a soldier's loyalty is tested under fire. Wearing the enemy's uniform (the Mark) is treason. Our allegiance must be clear _before_ the battle intensifies.

**_Whiteboard Visuals:_**

- _Keyword:_ MARK / SEAL / COERCION
- _Diagram:_ Rev 13 (Image/Mark -> Worship Beast) vs. Rev 14 (Commandments/Faith -> Worship Creator)
- _Verse:_ Rev 13:16-17 / Rev 14:7
- _Question:_ Whose Authority? (God vs. Beast Power)

**_Discussion Questions:_** (Allow brief time)

- _(Simple/Recall):_ "According to Revelation 13, what methods will be used to enforce worship of the beast and its image?"
- _(Reflection):_ "How does understanding these historical 'precursors' (like Daniel 3 or early church persecution) help us prepare for what Revelation describes?"
- _(Application):_ "If economic pressure ('buy or sell') is a key part of the final test, how can we cultivate dependence on God rather than material security _today_?"

### IV. Preparation for the Crisis: Character and the Sabbath Test (8-10 mins)

- **A. The Centrality of the Sabbath:**

  - Core Teaching Point: The final conflict crystallizes over worship, specifically testing loyalty to God as Creator through obedience to His sign of authority – the seventh-day Sabbath – versus allegiance to human-mandated worship (Sunday).
  - Biblical Foundation: Rev 14:7 (Worship Him who made...) linked to Exodus 20:8-11 (Sabbath commandment points to Creator). Rev 14:12 contrasts those who worship the beast (v. 9-11) with those who "keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."
  - EGW Insight: "The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially controverted. When the final test shall be brought to bear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who serve God and those who serve Him not." (GC 605.2).
  - Application/Problem Tackled: Viewing the Sabbath merely as a day off, rather than a profound sign of allegiance to the Creator God in the face of counterfeit worship.

- **B. Faithfulness in the Present:** [*]
  - Core Teaching Point: Standing firm in the great crisis requires a character built through daily faithfulness in "little things." Unwavering loyalty then depends on consistent surrender and obedience now.
  - Biblical Foundation: Luke 16:10 ("He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much..."). Our response to tests of integrity, honesty, and obedience today shapes our character for the ultimate test.
  - EGW Insight: "Since those who keep God's commandments are thus placed in contrast with those that worship the beast and his image and receive his mark, it follows that the keeping of God's law, on the one hand, and its violation, on the other, will make the distinction between the worshipers of God and the worshipers of the beast." (GC 445.3). The distinction is obedience rooted in faith.
  - Application/Need for God's Power: This standard is impossible in human strength. It requires daily connection to Christ, seeking His power for transformation (sanctification).

**_Illustrative Speaking Notes:_** (Choose 1-2)

- _Analogy:_ Building on the Rock vs. Sand (Matt 7) - A house built on sand (compromise, convenience, fear) collapses under the storm (final crisis). A house built on the Rock (Christ, His Word, daily obedience) stands firm. Our building is happening _now_.
- _Idiom:_ Showing Your True Colors - The crisis doesn't _create_ our allegiance; it _reveals_ the allegiance we've already chosen through our daily walk.

**_Whiteboard Visuals:_**

- _Keyword:_ SABBATH = SEAL / LOYALTY
- _Diagram:_ Daily Choices -> Character -> Final Stand
- _Verse:_ Rev 14:12 / Luke 16:10
- _Quote Snippet:_ "...great test of loyalty." (GC 605)

**_Discussion Questions:_** (Allow brief time)

- _(Simple/Observation):_ "According to Revelation 14:12, what two characteristics define God's people in the last days?"
- _(Reflection):_ "Why do you think the Sabbath, specifically, becomes the focal point of the final test of loyalty described in prophecy?"
- _(Application):_ "What is one 'small thing' in your life right now where being faithful to God requires conscious effort and reliance on His strength?"

### V. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary: Reiterate core takeaways: The final crisis is fundamentally about **worship** and **allegiance**. History (Daniel 3) and prophecy (Rev 13) show a coming global pressure to compromise God's law, specifically the Sabbath.
- Character Focus Recap: God calls us to **unyielding loyalty**, built not on fear, but on love, faith, and a character transformed by His grace through daily obedience. This is the essence of readiness.
  - _(Whiteboard: Key Character Trait: FAITHFULNESS / COURAGE)_
- Call to Action/Decision: The time to choose our allegiance is **now**. Don't wait for the crisis. Choose today to stand fully for Christ, to obey His Word completely, starting with faithfulness in the details of life and honoring His holy Sabbath.
  - _(Whiteboard: Call to Action Keyword: CHOOSE / STAND FIRM)_
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "What one step will you take this week to deepen your loyalty to Christ and His truth?" (Lead into prayer)
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The pressure will be immense, but God promises His presence and power (2 Tim 1:7). He _will_ have a people who stand loyal (Rev 14:12). Let us determine, by His grace, to be among them.
  - EGW: "All will take sides... All such are numbered with the enemies of Christ; for Christ says, 'He that is not with me is against me...'" (ARSH Feb 7, 1893, par. 12).
  - _(Whiteboard: Final Verse Ref or Hope phrase: Rev 14:12 / "He Gives Strength!")_
