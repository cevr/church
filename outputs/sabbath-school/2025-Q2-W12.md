# 2025 Q2 W12 - June 14-20

## Precursors

**Overarching Theme:** Unwavering Loyalty to God Amidst the Final Crisis
**Central Focus:** Cultivating the character of absolute faithfulness to God's
commands (especially regarding worship and His Sabbath) as revealed in
Scripture, empowered by His Spirit (power, love, sound mind), in preparation for
the final test and the restoration of His image in us. **Key Texts:** Daniel
3:17-18; Revelation 14:12; Matthew 12:9-14; Acts 12:5

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

---

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)

- Hook: Have you ever noticed how history seems to echo? Certain patterns,
  certain conflicts repeat. The Bible shows us that key events in the past are
  not just history; they are **precursors**, foreshadowing the final great
  controversy over God's authority and worship.
- Theme Introduction: Today, we explore the profound biblical theme of
  **Unwavering Loyalty to God**. This isn't just about ancient stories; it's
  about the **scriptural depth** of character God requires, especially as we
  face earth's final crisis.
  - [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Unwavering Loyalty to God"
- Connection to Character/Eternity: The Bible is clear: God is preparing a
  people to stand loyal to Him when the whole world is tested (Rev 14:12). This
  loyalty isn't just belief; it's a **character** reflecting Jesus, built
  through aligning our will with His. It's about the restoration of His image in
  us, making us ready for His return.
- Roadmap: We'll examine the fiery test in Daniel 3, see echoes in the early
  church's persecution and the Sabbath conflicts in Christ's ministry, and
  connect these directly to Revelation's final call for loyalty.

### II. The Fiery Test of Loyalty (Daniel 3) (15-18 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** Let's turn to Daniel 3. Here we see a direct
  confrontation between human authority demanding false worship and God's
  faithful servants choosing loyalty at any cost. This is a foundational
  precursor.

#### A. The Human Command vs. God's Law (Dan 3:1-12) (5 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Daniel 3:4-6 - "Then a herald cried aloud: 'To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, that at the time you hear the sound... you shall fall down and worship the gold image that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up; and whoever does not fall down and worship shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.'"
        -   Reading/Context: The king commands universal worship of an image he created, directly challenging allegiance to the Creator God. The penalty for disobedience is death.
        -   [WB]: {Dan 3:6 / Command: Worship Image OR Die}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This wasn't just about bowing; it was about ultimate allegiance. Who has the right to command worship? Only the Creator. This command forced a choice between human law and God's eternal law (Exodus 20:3-5).
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation):* "What elements in this command (Dan 3:4-6) made it particularly difficult to disobey?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Daniel 3:12 - "There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego; these men, O king, have not paid due regard to you. They do not serve your gods or worship the gold image which you have set up."
        -   Reading/Connection: Their loyalty to God was noticed and reported. Faithfulness often brings opposition.
        -   [WB]: {Accusation: "Not Paid Due Regard"}
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: The pressure was immense – public spectacle, music, threat of horrific death. Compromise would seem easy, rationalizable. This reveals the need for **conviction** rooted deeply in God's Word, not circumstance.

#### B. The Character of Unconditional Faithfulness (Dan 3:16-18) (7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Daniel 3:16-18 - "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-Nego answered and said to the king, 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. **But if not**, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up.'"
        -   Reading/Context: Their response is respectful but resolute. Their loyalty is **not** conditional on deliverance.
        -   [WB]: {Dan 3:17-18 / "Able to deliver... BUT IF NOT... we will NOT serve"}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: This is the heart of unwavering loyalty! They believed God *could* save them, but their obedience wasn't based on that outcome. Their allegiance was to God Himself, His character, His law, regardless of personal cost. This is the character God seeks to perfect in His end-time people.
        -   [EGW]: "How did that heathen king know what the Son of God was like? The Hebrew captives filling positions of trust in Babylon had in life and character represented before him the truth... They had told of Christ, the Redeemer to come; and in the form of the fourth in the midst of the fire the king recognized the Son of God." ([PK 509.1]).
        -   [WB]: {EGW: "represented... the truth"}
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How does the phrase '**but if not**' challenge the way we sometimes think about faith and prayer?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a soldier deeply loyal to their country's constitution. Even if given an unlawful order by a superior officer, their ultimate allegiance is to the higher law, even if it means facing court-martial. The Hebrews' allegiance was to Heaven's constitution, God's Law.
        -   Connecting to Life: We face pressures to compromise God's standards daily – perhaps subtly. This account calls us to examine where our ultimate loyalty lies, even in small things (Luke 16:10).

#### C. God's Presence in the Fire (Dan 3:25) [*] (3 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Daniel 3:25 - "'Look!' he answered, 'I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire; and they are not hurt, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.'"
        -   Reading/Challenge: God didn't prevent the trial, but He joined them *in* it.
        -   [WB]: {Dan 3:25 / "Fourth is like the Son of God"}
        -   Practical Step: God promises His presence (Isaiah 43:2). Our part is to choose loyalty; His part is to sustain us through the trial, refining our character for His kingdom. This requires **conscious reliance** on Him moment by moment.
        -   [EGW]: "As His witnesses were cast into the furnace, the Saviour revealed Himself to them in person, and together they walked in the midst of the fire. In the presence of the Lord of heat and cold, the flames lost their power to consume." ([PK 508.4]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "Knowing God promises His presence *in* the fire, how does that change our perspective when facing difficult trials for our faith?"

### III. Echoes in the Early Church & Christ's Ministry (15-17 mins)

- **Introduction to Section:** The principles of Daniel 3 didn't end there. We
  see the same conflict over loyalty, worship, and God's law playing out in the
  New Testament – precursors to the final events.

#### A. Persecution and Divine Deliverance (Acts 12:1-17) (7 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Acts 12:1-5 - "Now about that time Herod the king stretched out his hand to harass some from the church... he proceeded further to seize Peter also... Peter was therefore kept in prison, but **constant prayer was offered to God for him by the church**."
        -   Reading/Context: The early church faced state-sanctioned persecution. James was killed, Peter imprisoned. The response? Earnest prayer.
        -   [WB]: {Acts 12:5 / Persecution -> Constant Prayer}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Loyalty to Christ provoked opposition. But the church understood their powerlessness and turned to God. Prayer is our lifeline, acknowledging our dependence and His sovereignty.
        -   [EGW]: "Will the Lord forget his people in this trying hour? ... Though enemies may thrust them into prison, yet dungeon walls cannot cut off the communication between their souls and Christ... angels will come to them in lonely cells, bringing light and peace from Heaven." ([GC 626.2]).
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Why is 'constant prayer' so crucial when God's people face opposition, according to Acts 12 and the EGW quote?"
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Acts 12:6-11 - Peter's miraculous deliverance by an angel.
        -   Reading/Connection: God intervened directly in response to prayer and Peter's faithfulness.
        -   [WB]: {Angelic Deliverance / God Hears Prayer}
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: God *can* deliver miraculously. But like Daniel 3, deliverance isn't guaranteed (James was martyred). Our loyalty must be rooted in God Himself, not just His potential interventions. This requires **trust** in His wisdom, even when we don't understand.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a child holding their father's hand in a storm. They trust the father's strength and wisdom, whether he calms the storm instantly or guides them safely through it. Our trust is in our Heavenly Father's hand.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How can we maintain unwavering trust in God, like Peter sleeping soundly (Acts 12:6), even when facing uncertain or dangerous outcomes?"

#### B. The Sabbath: A Battleground for Loyalty (Matt 12:9-14; John 5:1-16) (8 mins)

    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Matthew 12:9-14 - Jesus heals a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath. The Pharisees' response: "they went out and plotted how they might kill Him."
        -   Reading/Context: Jesus demonstrated the true, merciful purpose of the Sabbath, God's holy day.
        -   [WB]: {Matt 12:14 / Sabbath Healing -> Plot to Kill}
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** John 5:16 - "For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath."
        -   Reading/Connection: Again, acting in accordance with God's will for the Sabbath brought deadly opposition.
        -   [WB]: {John 5:16 / Sabbath Act -> Persecution}
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The conflict wasn't truly about Sabbath *breaking* (Jesus upheld the law), but about **authority**. Whose interpretation and commands would be followed – God's revealed will (love, mercy, rest in Him) or human traditions that distorted it? This foreshadows the final conflict where the Sabbath will be the central point of loyalty.
        -   [EGW]: "The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially controverted. When the final test shall be brought to bear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who serve God and those who serve Him not." ([GC 605.2]).
        -   [WB]: {EGW: Sabbath = Great Test of Loyalty}
        -   [DQ]: *(Interpretation):* "Based on these passages (Matt 12, John 5), what was the real issue the religious leaders had with Jesus regarding the Sabbath?"
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "How might the principle of choosing God's authority over human traditions regarding His Sabbath apply to us *today*, even before any final law?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)

- Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen in Daniel, Acts, and the Gospels a
  consistent biblical pattern: God calls for **unwavering loyalty** to His
  authority and His law, especially concerning worship, even amidst persecution
  and pressure to compromise.
- Character Focus Recap: The scriptures reveal the character needed for the last
  days: **faithfulness** like the Hebrews ("but if not..."), **trust** like
  Peter, **courage** rooted not in self but in God's Spirit (2 Tim 1:7 - power,
  love, sound mind), and **obedience** to God's commandments, including His
  Sabbath. This is the reflection of Jesus God desires to perfect in us.
  - [WB]: {Key Traits: `FAITHFULNESS` / `TRUST` / `COURAGE (2 Tim 1:7)`}
- Call to Action/Decision: The final test, foreshadowed by these precursors,
  will demand absolute loyalty (Rev 13 vs Rev 14). The time to cultivate this
  character, to settle into obedience to **all** of God's Word through His
  power, is **now**. Where is God calling you to deeper loyalty today?
  - [WB]: {Call to Action: `"CHOOSE LOYALTY NOW" (Rev 14:12)`}
  - _(Optional Final Question):_ "Based on God's Word today, what one specific
    area will you ask God to strengthen your loyalty and faithfulness this
    week?"
- Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: The conflict is real, the stakes are eternal.
  But God has not given us a spirit of fear! He offers power, love, and a sound
  mind to stand firm. Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and finisher of
  our faith, who endured the cross for the joy set before Him (Heb 12:2). He is
  coming soon for a people whose character reflects His own.
  - [WB]: {Final Hope: `"LOOKING UNTO JESUS" (Heb 12:2)` / `Rev 14:12`}
