**Key Texts:** Joshua 22:10-12; Numbers 25:1-9; Proverbs 15:1; John 17:21

**(Estimated Time: 45 Minutes Total)**

### I. Introduction (5-7 mins)
-   Hook: Imagine you see a fellow church member doing something that appears to be a serious violation of our faith—a clear compromise with the world. What is your very first, gut-level impulse? Is it to correct them immediately? To investigate quietly? To report it to leadership? This exact, high-stakes dilemma is what the nation of Israel faced on the banks of the Jordan.
-   Theme Introduction: Today’s study is not simply about conflict resolution. We will go deeper into the biblical account to explore a profound theme: **"Guarding the Purity of the Remnant: The Peril of Misguided Zeal."** It's about how God’s people, in their sincere desire to remain faithful, can nearly destroy one another through suspicion when zeal is not mingled with Christ's love.
    -   [WB]: Write Main Theme Title: "Guarding the Remnant: Zeal vs. Love"
-   Connection to Character/Eternity: In these last days, as the Great Controversy comes to its climax, Satan's most effective strategy is not always open attack from without, but creating division from within. Our very readiness for Christ's return depends on our cooperation with Him in developing a character that is fiercely loyal to His truth **and** fiercely loving toward His children.
-   Roadmap: We will journey into God's Word to examine the *root cause* of this near-holy war, the *divine principles* that defused it, and the *character transformation* God requires of us as we await His coming.

### II. The Anatomy of a Holy War: When Zeal Becomes a Weapon (15-18 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Let's first analyze the biblical record to understand *why* the western tribes reacted with such speed and ferocity. This was not a simple misunderstanding; it was a response born from a holy fear of corporate sin and its devastating consequences.

#### A. The Alarming Act & the Extreme Reaction (6 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 22:10-12
        -   Reading/Context: After years of faithful service, the eastern tribes head home. But on the border, they build "a great altar to see to." The moment the other tribes hear of it, "the whole congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them."
        -   [WB]: Altar Built -> WAR!
        -   Unpacking the Truth: Notice the immediacy. There was no delegation sent to ask questions, no letter of inquiry. The first response was to gather for war. This reveals a deep-seated conviction that a great sin, a rebellion against God, was underway.
        -   [DQ]: *(Observation/Interpretation):* "At first glance, does this reaction from the western tribes seem righteous or reckless to you? Why?"

#### B. The Unhealed Trauma of Past Apostasy (9 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Joshua 22:17
        -   Reading/Connection: Phinehas, leading the delegation, doesn't just accuse them of a new sin. He immediately connects it to the past: "Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD...?"
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Numbers 25:3-4, 9
        -   Reading/Context: Let's turn back to see what Phinehas was referencing. "And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel." God commanded the leaders to be executed, and a plague swept through the camp, killing **twenty-four thousand** people.
        -   [WB]: Sin of Peor = 24,000 Dead
        -   Deeper Insight & Character Need: This was not just a historical event; it was a deep, unhealed national trauma. They had learned a terrible lesson: open sin in the camp separates the whole nation from God and invites His judgments upon everyone. Their zeal for purity was correct, but it was driven by fear and suspicion.
        -   [EGW]: The sin at Peor showed them that "the poison had spread, like a deadly infection, through the camp of Israel. Those who would have conquered their enemies in battle were overcome by the wiles of heathen women... they separated them from God." [PP 454].
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "How can past church failures or even our own past sins (our 'Baal Peors') make us suspicious or harsh when we see something questionable in a brother or sister today?"
    -   **Illustration & Application Bridge:**
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* Imagine a family that almost lost their home to a fire caused by a single faulty wire. For years afterward, they are hypersensitive to any flicker of the lights or strange smell, fearing another disaster. Israel's fear of apostasy was like this—a spiritual post-traumatic stress.
    -   **Foundation Text 4:** Joshua 22:20
        -   Reading/Challenge: Phinehas adds another example: "Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on **all** the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity."
        -   [WB]: Achan's sin = National Defeat
        -   Practical Step: They understood the principle of corporate responsibility. They believed they were their brother's keeper. This is a divine principle. The danger, and the test of character, comes when our methods for keeping our brother are devoid of humility, patience, and love.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "As God's remnant people, we feel a responsibility for the purity of the church. Where is the line between righteous concern for holiness and the sin of harsh judgment?"

### III. The Character of a Peacemaker: When Grace Defuses a Crisis (15-17 mins)
-   **Introduction to Section:** Now let's examine the beautiful, Spirit-led response that averted a civil war. Here we find the very character traits God is seeking to develop in His people to prepare them for heaven.

#### A. The Supernatural Power of a Gentle Answer (7 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 1:** Joshua 22:21
        -   Reading/Context: The eastern tribes are facing their brethren, armed for war and leveling the most serious charge possible: treason against God Himself. Their response was not a counter-accusation. They simply "answered and said..."
    -   **Foundation Text 2:** Proverbs 15:1
        -   Reading/Connection: This is the divine principle in action: "A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger."
        -   [WB]: Accusation -> SOFT ANSWER -> Peace
        -   Unpacking the Truth: The natural, carnal heart, when falsely accused, responds with pride, indignation, and self-defense. To respond with meekness is a supernatural act—it is evidence of a heart being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
        -   [EGW]: "Even under false accusation those who are in the right can afford to be calm and considerate. God is acquainted with all that is misunderstood and misinterpreted by men, and we can safely leave our case in His hands... Those who are actuated by the spirit of Christ will possess that charity which suffers long and is kind." [PP 519, 520].
        -   [WB]: "...afford to be calm..." - PP 519
        -   [DQ]: *(Reflection):* "Sister White says the innocent can 'afford to be calm.' From your experience, why is it often *hardest* to be calm when you know you are innocent and have been wronged?"

#### B. Clarifying Motive, Not Just Defending Action (8 mins)
    -   **Foundation Text 3:** Joshua 22:24-27
        -   Reading/Context: They don't just deny the charge. They open their hearts and reveal their deepest fear: "Because we were afraid... for fear lest your children should speak to our children in time to come, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of Israel?" The altar was not for sacrifice, but a **"witness"** that they were one people.
        -   [WB]: Altar ≠ Sacrifice. Altar = A WITNESS
        -   Deeper Insight: This is the key that unlocked peace. They moved the conversation from the **action** (building an altar) to the **motive** (fear of being cut off from God's family). When the western tribes understood their brothers' hearts, the crisis ended.
        -   [SN]: *Illustration:* It's like a child who quietly takes a photograph from a parent's wallet. The parent might accuse them of stealing. But the child tearfully explains, "I was just going to school and I was scared, and I wanted to have you with me." The motive changes everything.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "In a church or family misunderstanding, what is one practical step we can take to move the conversation from 'what you did' to 'why you did it'?"
    -   **Foundation Text 4 & 5:** Joshua 22:31 & John 17:21
        -   Reading/Promise: Phinehas declares, "This day we perceive that the **LORD is among us**, because ye have not committed this trespass." This fulfills the spirit of Christ's ultimate prayer: "...that they all may be one... that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."
        -   [WB]: Unity = Evidence of God's Presence
        -   Practical Step: Unity is the condition for God's manifest presence among His people and the power of our witness to the world. Preserving it is not optional; it is central to our mission.
        -   [DQ]: *(Application):* "According to Christ's prayer in John 17, what is the ultimate consequence for our mission when God's people are divided?"

### IV. Conclusion & Appeal (5-8 mins)
-   Summary of **Biblical** Truths: We've seen from God's Word that sincere zeal for truth, when not governed by the Spirit of Christ, can become a weapon that nearly destroys God's people. We learned that the trauma of past sin can breed a spirit of suspicion. But we also saw the glorious power of a gentle, honest answer to restore peace and confirm God's presence among His people.
-   Character Focus Recap: The final test of character is not just believing the right doctrines, but reflecting the loving character of Jesus in how we treat our brethren. God is calling us to develop the patient spirit of the eastern tribes and the humble spirit of the western tribes, who were willing to listen and rejoice when they were proven wrong.
    -   [WB]: ZEAL + LOVE = TRUE HOLINESS
-   Call to Action/Decision: The Bible calls us to "follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord." This week, when you are tempted to assume the worst about a brother or sister, will you commit to choosing courteous inquiry over quick condemnation? Will you pray for them before you judge them?
    -   [WB]: Call to Action: "SEEK PEACE, AND PURSUE IT" (Psalm 34:14)
-   Final Thought/Urgency & Hope: Our unity is not merely a nice idea; it is a divine command and the condition for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. As we prepare for the imminent return of Jesus, let us plead with God for a character that possesses both the righteous zeal of Phinehas and the all-encompassing love of Christ for His church. Only then can the world see Him in us.
    -   [WB]: Final Hope: "That they all may be ONE." (John 17:21)
